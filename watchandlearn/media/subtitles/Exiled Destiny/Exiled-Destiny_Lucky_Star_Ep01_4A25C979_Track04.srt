1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,134
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater

2
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,435
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater
Okay, let's do this!

3
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,470
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater
Let's go!

4
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,037
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater
- Grr!

5
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:04,504
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater
- Quit screwing around and start!
- Grr!

6
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
Kagami Yoshimizu Theater
- Quit screwing around and start!

7
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,009
The ambiguous 3cm?
Does that mean it's plushy? Wait!

8
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,345
The wrapping is a uniform, argh,
it's not an act, pooh

9
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,047
Gotta do your best, gotta just do it

10
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,548
That's time to catch 'n' release, eek

11
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,650
Between sweat (whoop)
sweat (whoop)

12
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,619
Darlin', darlin', freeze!

13
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,593
Kinda lethargic,
something's kinda comin' out

14
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,561
I love you... Oh wait,
one of those was different

15
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,796
Worrywarts, high metal bars

16
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,598
Tasty thoughts... And that's enough!

17
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,400
The heated body of that
flying you-know-who

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,135
It's what you call a normal girlie

19
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,036
Am I the only one surprised?

20
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,404
Seconds on pork-bone broth ramen
with wire-hard noodles

21
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,336
Da da da da da

22
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,379
Pom-poms cheer squad

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,081
Let's get cherry pie

24
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,582
Happy fun welcoming party

25
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,151
Look up! Sensation

26
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,154
Yeah! Feeling of existence,
dot dot small planet

27
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,755
Collided and it melted away,
in total awe

28
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,524
Go all out to sing, shi-ranger!

29
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,691
Take it away!

30
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:03,163
I should be the one who'll be
laughing in the end

31
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:10,370
Because I have the sailor suit
<- This is my conclusion

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,372
It's only Monday!

33
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,109
Already in a bad mood? What to do?

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,882
I really prefer the summer outfits
<- kya! wah! good! (cute!) <3

35
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,119
Until we approach 3 pixels,
no hesitations please *

36
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,554
Do your best, be energetic

37
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,749
My darlin', darlin' please!

38
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,820
On your mark, get set...

39
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,071
Nothing less from Kona-chan!
Amazing!

40
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,542
You're so good at sports.

41
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,145
Why don't you join any
of the athletic teams?

42
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,814
Because if I join any of the teams,

43
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,484
I won't be able to watch any of
the prime-time anime shows.

44
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,453
The Girl Who Dashes Off

45
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,453
Hey, Tsukasa, which end of
a choco-cornet do you eat first?

46
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,234
From the head end first, right?

47
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,166
I see...

48
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,404
By the way, which end is the head?

49
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,167
The fatter end, or the thinner end?

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,744
I think this end,
the thin side, is the head.

51
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,612
I see... I thought that
the fatter end was the head.

52
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,551
So, why is the thinner end the head?

53
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,820
I mean, doesn't this look
like a type of seashell?

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,156
Why do you think it's
the fatter end, Kona-chan?

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,522
'Cause it looks like a caterpillar.

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
A caterpillar?

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,789
Well, but when you think about it,
the seashell gives a better image.

58
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,605
Um...

59
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,316
You can also tear the thin end off,

60
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,513
and dip it in the extra chocolate
cream on the fatter end.

61
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,481
I get it!

62
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,928
Nothing less from Miyuki-san!
You're so smart!

63
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,498
No... Each person has their
own way of eating, so...

64
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,659
How do you eat a cream puff?

65
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,869
A cream puff?

66
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,305
Let's see... I start off by

67
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,273
splitting it into two, taking the lid,

68
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,609
and dipping it into
the cream in the pot area.

69
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,413
Then, after that, I start
eating the pot area.

70
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,683
That way, no cream spurts out,

71
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,210
and I can eat both the pastry and
the cream in a balanced way.

72
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,358
There are some that have both
custard and whipped cream, right?

73
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,261
How do you eat those?
Do you mix them?

74
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,397
No, I don't go out of my way
to mix the two.

75
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,266
Wait, how exactly would you
mix them together?

76
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,335
No, I was just asking.

77
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,837
When do you eat the strawberry
on top of a strawberry shortcake,

78
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,706
or the chestnut on top
of a mont-blanc?

79
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,341
Let's see...

80
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,576
That depends on the amount
of strawberries

81
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,912
that are sandwiched between
the two layers of sponge cake.

82
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,715
I try to think about the pace
in which I eat the strawberries,

83
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,851
the whipped cream,
and the sponge cake.

84
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,810
So the timing in which I eat the
strawberry on top always differs.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,920
That's well thought out.

86
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,961
I always save it for last,

87
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,965
but sometimes, I get so full
that I can't eat it after all,

88
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,934
or someone in my family
takes it away from me.

89
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,070
You have to eat your favorite
food at the beginning, after all.

90
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,939
Come to think of it,
I don't think I've ever seen

91
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,275
my big sister having her
strawberry taken from her.

92
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,310
That's Kagami for you.
Doesn't leave herself open.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,714
Can you eat the last bite
on a popsicle without dropping it?

94
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,349
Does it drop?

95
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,907
When you don't eat it right...

96
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,421
It drops off, doesn't it?

97
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,322
Yes.

98
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,556
How do you go about it, Kona-chan?

99
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,325
I lick it up to the end.

100
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,092
Wow...

101
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,029
Why not keep turning it around
while you eat, like this?

102
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,563
Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

103
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,532
I'm not really one for
soft-serve ice cream.

104
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,299
Why not?

105
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,105
I dislike being left with
just the cone in the end.

106
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,475
Right, right! You always have
just the cone left in the end!

107
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,444
I always try to push the ice cream

108
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,345
further and further
into the cone as I eat.

109
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,949
How do you push it down?

110
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,349
As I eat, like, with a push and shove.

111
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,278
A push and shove, is it...

112
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,090
Yuki-chan, you're always concerned
about balance, aren't you?

113
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,358
I suppose so.

114
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,460
Then how do you eat curried rice?

115
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,362
Do you mix the curry roux
with the rice when you eat?

116
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,831
No, I don't mix the two,

117
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
but I always try to have
an equal amount left.

118
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,501
I mix them up.

119
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,536
What about you, Kona-chan?

120
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,937
It depends on the curry.

121
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,406
When I pour on some sauce,
or drop a raw egg on it,

122
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,075
I tend to mix it up, I guess.

123
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,476
Sauce? On curry?

124
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,777
Yeah. It's tasty.

125
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,013
Do you use sauce on fried eggs too?

126
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,482
No, it's soy sauce for fried eggs.

127
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,118
I see... I use mayonnaise.

128
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,088
On fried eggs? Not hard-boiled eggs?

129
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,858
Yeah. Mayonnaise goes well
with basically every egg dish.

130
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,393
You put it on curry too?

131
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,561
Yeah.

132
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,664
Of course, I do on plain white rice too,
but also on beef bowls.

133
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,566
It goes well with that sweet broth.

134
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,401
It's also good on
chicken and egg bowls.

135
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,737
You know how egg and chicken
are child and parent, right?

136
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,140
So, I put some mayonnaise
that's made from eggs on it,

137
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,337
and call it the Relative Bowl.

138
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,646
That, and I used to hate natto beans,

139
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,648
but I can eat them when
I put mayonnaise on them.

140
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,517
Ew, I can't even imagine that.

141
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,886
Oh, but the tastiest thing must be

142
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,789
when you put mayonnaise
on soft-boiled eggs.

143
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,417
In our house, even
the fried eggs are half cooked.

144
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,528
That's how my dad likes it.

145
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,865
I guess he likes sucking on the yolk.

146
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,802
So if you fry the yolk too much,
he can't suck it out anymore.

147
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,670
How do you eat chicken skewers?

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,838
What do you mean, how?

149
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,507
Do you eat it right off the skewer?

150
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,675
Or do you take the meat off
the skewer with chopsticks?

151
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,144
Let's see.

152
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,179
When I eat the entire
skewer by myself,

153
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,414
I'll eat it as is,

154
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,816
but when I'm eating in a crowd,
I separate it from the skewer.

155
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,720
Oh, yeah, don't you feel awkward
when one last morsel is left?

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,056
Yes. The very last piece is very
difficult to put your hands on.

157
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,786
And with nobody eating it,
time passes,

158
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,097
and it gets all dry and obviously
not so tasty looking,

159
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,932
and nobody really wants it anymore.

160
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,801
But when the server tries
to take the plate away,

161
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,703
you say, "Oh, we're still
eating that," and stuff.

162
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,440
And yet, we sometimes go home
without eating it after all.

163
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,041
It's such a waste.

164
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,838
I feel sorry for it...

165
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,212
Oh, you know, I also feel sorry for

166
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,080
that one piece of meat
that's left on the grill

167
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,849
and turns into charcoal when
you go for Korean barbecue.

168
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,050
Well, with Korean barbecue,

169
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,519
you're always eating and
chatting at the same time,

170
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,221
so you end up pretty busy.

171
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,256
Salted beef tongue with green
onions roasts really quickly,

172
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,925
so it's especially hurried.

173
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:43,729
You're right. It's already done
by the time you flip it over once.

174
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,162
You flip it over?

175
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,866
Salted tongue with green onions?

176
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,500
- Yeah.

177
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,900
- You shouldn't flip those over!
- Yeah.

178
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,027
- You shouldn't flip those over!

179
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,604
Is that so?

180
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,839
I mean, when you flip it over,

181
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,241
all the green onions on top
fall into the grill!

182
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,742
Oh, you're right.

183
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,478
You don't need to flip it over.

184
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,545
You just roast one side,

185
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,614
and enough heat is distributed
over the meat naturally.

186
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,217
I see. I'll do that from now on.

187
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,552
You absolutely, positively
shouldn't flip it over.

188
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,753
Is that so?

189
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,821
Yeah.

190
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,118
No kidding...

191
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,794
Anyway, the fatter end
and the thinner end,

192
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,058
which end is the head
of a choco-cornet?

193
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:17,964

A mega bad boy!

Confined for Two Months
[Princess Confinement]
"I wanted to enslave..."

196
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,768
There sure are a lot of
confinement crimes lately.

197
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,568
Like, having a girl call you
"Master" and stuff.

198
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,542
You know, isn't that more
because of guys playing

199
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,678
too may dating sims and erotic games,
rather than just moral degeneration?

200
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,514
That's a really common situation.

201
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,744
You're really talking about yourself!

202
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,621
Wait a second. Why do you know
what goes on in those adult games?

203
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,952
You're in eleventh grade, right?

204
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,088

First Trimester Midterm Results
3rd: Miyuki Takara

206
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,253
You're amazing, always
at the top of your class.

207
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,631
Miyuki-san, do you have
any faults at all?

208
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,537
I am embarrassed to say,
but sometimes,

209
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,607
I tend to think things out too much,
or just plain space out.

210
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,943
- Sometimes I slice my finger
using a vegetable slicer,

211
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,677
- Ouch!
- Sometimes I slice my finger
using a vegetable slicer,

212
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:04,944
- Ouch!
- or trip over my own feet
and fall down,

213
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,214
- or trip over my own feet
and fall down,

214
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,809
or get one end of my tote bag
caught in the train door.

215
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,185
Miyuki-san, you don't call those faults.
You call them "moe points".

216
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,691
- Moe?

217
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:18,925
- Clumsiness is your element?
- Moe?

218
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,725
- Clumsiness is your element?

219
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,329
What kind of images are running in
your head right now, Kona-chan?!

220
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,332
Miyuki-san, you're attractive enough.
Why do you wear glasses?

221
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,568
You can only target a certain breed
of people like that, you know?

222
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,169
Target?

223
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,572
Putting aside whether
she's popular with guys,

224
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,206
why don't you switch to contacts?

225
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,909
I hear that eyeglasses tend
to make your vision worse.

226
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,845
Well, it's embarrassing to say now
that we're in high school and all,

227
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,849
but, well, I...

228
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,719
I'm afraid of contact lenses!

229
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,156
Or rather, I'm scared of
putting anything into my eyes.

230
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,825
I can't even open
my eyes underwater.

231
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,784
Damn, she's really cute.
A natural airhead...

232
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,990
Oh, isn't that Miyuki-san?

233
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,166
Yoshimizu Optometrist

234
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,169
Yoshimizu Optometrist
Maybe she came to get
an eye exam for contacts?

235
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:03,897
Yoshimizu Optometrist

236
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,075
Maybe Miyuki-san is better
off like that forever.

237
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,176
That looks painful...

238
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,110
She's a living national monument.

239
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,315
Kagami's sick at home
with a cold today?

240
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:20,119
Yeah. At least it doesn't seem
like she's got the flu.

241
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,782
I'm an idiot, so I have no worries
about catching the flu and stuff.

242
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,192
I hear that about a cold often enough,

243
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,683
but that works for the flu too?

244
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,999
Colds and the flu are different things?

245
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,267
I thought the flu was just
the deluxe version of a cold.

246
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,803
I think it's different...

247
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,102
But when you ask me like that,
I'm not really so sure myself anymore.

248
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,310
The difference between
influenza and a cold?

249
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,678
Yup, yup.

250
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,213
Well, let's see.

251
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,715
Influenza is viral,

252
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,885
and has many full-body symptoms
such as fever and muscle aches,

253
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,821
and furthermore can
have complications.

254
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,289
On the other hand, a cold is mainly

255
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,225
inflammation of the throat
and a runny nose,

256
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,327
and your fever doesn't
end up that high.

257
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,463
The detailed symptoms
are different as well.

258
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,464
Hmm...

259
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,661
So these two are different illnesses.

260
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,666
Really...

261
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,838
But...

262
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,408
Well, there are a lot of
common aspects as well,

263
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,178
so you could still say the flu
is a scaled-up model of a cold.

264
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,236
I see!

265
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,251
Kona-chan, what's with that
serious look on your face?

266
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,119
Well, it's nothing big,

267
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,221
but something's been on my mind
about this morning's conversation.

268
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,757
You mean about the cold and the flu?

269
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,327
Tsukasa, you didn't deny it even once
when I said I was an idiot.

270
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,727
It's not like that!
That's not what I meant...

271
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,937
Oh, welcome, Konata.

272
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,106
She came by to visit Sis.

273
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,208
Oh, thank you for
coming all the way out.

274
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,733
No problem. Excuse me!

275
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,085
Heh, Kagami's face is unexpectedly
cute when she's asleep.

276
00:11:59,085 --> 00:11:59,819
- What?! What are you
doing here?! Go home!

277
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,878
- Oh, she's up, she's awake.
- What?! What are you
doing here?! Go home!

278
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,758
A visit? You? All the way
out here just for me?

279
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,859
That's right.

280
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,794
But I'd feel bad if you
caught what I have,

281
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,763
so I'll just take the sentiments.

282
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,299
What's with this? It makes me happy.

283
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,870
A new type of virus is going around,
so she's worried about me?

284
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,874
I thought that the only things she
thinks about were games and anime.

285
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,739
I'm kind of touched now.

286
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,481
Well, I'd like to copy that
homework we got the other day.

287
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,349
That, and you showed me
a really cute sleeping face,

288
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,751
so don't worry about it.

289
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,740
Go home!

290
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,855
Kagami, Miyuki is here to visit you!

291
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,458
Okay...

292
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,860
Excuse me.

293
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,028
Oh, I'm sorry to trouble you
on a holiday.

294
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,397
Is it all right for you to be up?

295
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:45,898
- I brought this as a get-well gift.

296
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,832
- Thanks!
- I brought this as a get-well gift.

297
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,467
I'm almost completely well.

298
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,336
I took some medicine,
so my fever is down too.

299
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,370
Here.

300
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,773
Flowers and fruit! I'm so happy!

301
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,874
Oh, do sit down.

302
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,809
Thank you so much.

303
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,513
I had thought of visiting
right away with Izumi-san,

304
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,882
but I couldn't find the time
to do so yesterday...

305
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,247
It's all right, it's fine.

306
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,920
I was entrusted with the
committee meeting minutes.

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,512
Oh, thank you!

308
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,091
If you can take a look at it,

309
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,993
though not so much as to
worsen your condition...

310
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:14,860
Sure.

311
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,130
That, and these are the budget
requests for each club...

312
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,801
And what else did I have... Let's see...

313
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,172
Oh, if you're not feeling well
right now, I'll go home now.

314
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,574
This is what a visit
really should be like!

315
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,810
Had something happened?

316
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,472
Actually, Konata came by yesterday...

317
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,182
Oh, brother.

318
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,820
Perhaps that was Izumi-san's way
of caring for you?

319
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,888
About the homework, perhaps
she was goofing around

320
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,192
in an effort to cheer
you up, Kagami-san.

321
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,029
And your sleeping face might
have been an inevitable result

322
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,131
of trying not to make noise.

323
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,066
Is this girl a saint or something?!

324
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,101
I can't think of it that way at all!

325
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,139
Come to think of it,
is Tsukasa-san out today?

326
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,441
Morning...

327
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,207
Sis, are you feeling any better?

328
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:13,279
See for yourself. She lives
a more relaxed life than the ill.

329
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,022
Well, I'm not always like this.

330
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,059
Today, it's like that "One sleeps
late in the spring" thing.

331
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,628
Oh, it's a little late to
say this, but welcome.

332
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,996
I know how that is.

333
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,599
I have trouble waking up
in the morning myself lately.

334
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:30,002
Isn't that it? I'm so sleepy lately...

335
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,439
That's true. It's especially
warm out today.

336
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,040
Yeah, yeah. Like that.

337
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,675
You can't help it.

338
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,245
The holiday we had the other day
was really warm too, right?

339
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,145
Yes.

340
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,982
When I woke up, it was already dusk.

341
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,150
I spent most of the day asleep.

342
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,953
It's better to rest when you can.

343
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,123
In the end, I spent that
entire day in my pajamas.

344
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,216
Oh, I guess the same goes for today.

345
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,088
Is what you have on
right now your pajamas?

346
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,963
Yeah, it is.

347
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,133
That is very cute! They don't
look like pajamas at all!

348
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,034
Really?

349
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,035
Yes.

350
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,904
Is it all right for me
to stay in this outfit?

351
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,239
Yes. I think you could walk
around outside like that.

352
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,606
- Maybe I can head to the
convenience store like this?

353
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,174
- Man, it's an endless wait
for the punch line...
- Maybe I can head to the
convenience store like this?

354
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,676
- Man, it's an endless wait
for the punch line...
- Yes, I think it would
probably be all right...

355
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,075
Nurse's Office

356
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,603
A slight increase...

357
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,049
No, that's not it!

358
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,052
The bra I'm wearing today has
underwires and a large pad in it,

359
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,687
so I'm heavier by that much!

360
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,723
Right, that's it. I wonder
how much it is in grams?

361
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,158
If I can subtract that much...

362
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,147
Nurse's Office

363
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,529
It's over...

364
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,231
I screwed up!

365
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,066
I forgot that the physical exam
was today,

366
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,735
so I wore character-print
underwear today!

367
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,635
I'm so embarrassed!

368
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,370
Nurse's Office

369
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,507
I haven't grown!

370
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:41,973
Nurse's Office

371
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,973
Dammit! Why are you
the only one looking confident?!

372
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,147
S'up? I'm here.

373
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, Sis.

374
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,973
Just a thought...

375
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,186
Kagami, you come here
to hang out a lot.

376
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,188
Don't you have friends in your class?

377
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,023
Don't put me in the same boat as you.

378
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,124
Are you picking a fight with me?

379
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,627
What, I thought that you were
shunned by your classmates.

380
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,095
Before you worry about others,

381
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,397
why don't you worry about yourself?
You have zero social skills!

382
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,499
I have no worries about that.

383
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,336
I may look like this, but I have
about a hundred friends,

384
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,639
and my social and bargaining
skills are pretty high,

385
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,937
and I join a party every night.

386
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,044
With my allies, I work to bring
back the glimmer in crystals

387
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,046
to prevent the world
from falling to ruin,

388
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,147
and rescue the kidnapped princess...

389
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,016
Wait, you're talking about a game!

390
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,318
I haven't seen that guy
around for a while...

391
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:26,986
- Who?

392
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,319
- She's talking about one of
her game buddies, I'm sure.
- Who?

393
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,116
- She's talking about one of
her game buddies, I'm sure.

394
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,991
Yeah. He was
a soldier-type character,

395
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,492
but he wanted to raise
his combat skills,

396
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,561
and he left saying
he was going to train

397
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,654
in an area with a lot of monsters...

398
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,033
And he hasn't come back since.

399
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,635
I heard he's camping out
in the underground nest.

400
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,372
But I wonder if he's all right,
acting all hermit-like?

401
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,273
Everyone's getting pretty worried.

402
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,175
A hermit inside a game?

403
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,013
I don't know the details,
but from the login info,

404
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
it looks like he's been
playing the game nonstop.

405
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,117
A hermit, both in real life
and in virtual life!

406
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,486
Well, it's the same guy doing it, so...

407
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,354
By the way, how did you two get to
know each other, Tsukasa, Konata?

408
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,294
Tsukasa was about to be taken away
by some suspicious big foreign guy,

409
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,730
and just then I arrived on the scene
in the nick of time!

410
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,433
And I used my strong moves, the
front punch and the whirlwind kick,

411
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,702
ever so gracefully to rescue her!

412
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,471
Why does she end up talking about
games in every conversation?

413
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,275
Well, actually, I just showed
my skills as a martial artist.

414
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,477
I don't approve of
starting off with violence,

415
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,112
but that's one of your
good points, I guess.

416
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,548
Actually, the foreigner was
just asking for directions,

417
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,583
but I didn't understand
what he was saying at all,

418
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,619
and was troubled when
Kona-chan came by...

419
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,054
Wait, that's no good at all!

420
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,089
Why are you acting like
you won the battle?!

421
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,286
The time has finally come again...

422
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,061
Is something going on?

423
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,164
Well, pro baseball season has started.

424
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,567
Kona-chan, you don't like
watching sports and stuff?

425
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,402
You seem to be good
with anything athletic.

426
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,538
I thought you'd be the type that
would like watching that stuff.

427
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,207
But when extra innings delay
all the following programs,

428
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,199
it throws off the recording times
for all the late-night anime,

429
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,214
and at worst, the broadcast
itself gets cancelled.

430
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,217
It sucks to have something
you like disappear.

431
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,885
Kagami, when do you
eat the strawberry

432
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,454
on top of a strawberry shortcake?

433
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,188
- Why?

434
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:09,455
- I was wondering if you were the type
- Why?

435
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,656
- I was wondering if you were the type

436
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,524
that saves your favorites
until the end.

437
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,160
It's true that I eat
my favorite stuff last,

438
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,329
but when it comes to
strawberries, it depends.

439
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,320
Then do you roast both sides of
salted tongue with green onions?

440
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,390
Salted tongue with green onions?

441
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,869
They roast very quickly to begin with,

442
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,904
but when you roast both sides,
it gets done even faster.

443
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,273
You shouldn't!
The green onions will fall off.

444
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,176
I thought you put the green onions
on top after the meat's all roasted!

445
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,445
If you do that, the green onions
don't get roasted at all.

446
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,381
Aren't the green onions acting
as a condiment in the first place?

447
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,117
You don't get it at all...

448
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,244
Well, maybe both ways are all right.

449
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,188
Which side of a choco-cornet
do you think is the head,

450
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,122
the fatter end, or the thinner end?

451
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,255
The fatter end?

452
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,228
You're agreeing with me.

453
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,162
Seriously?

454
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,096
Then which end do you eat first?

455
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,266
Aren't you supposed to
tear off the thinner end,

456
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,200
and dip it in the leftover chocolate
cream in the fatter end?

457
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,270
Really...

458
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,294
Yeah.

459
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,845
Have you ever made friends
in real life other than us?

460
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,818
I used to have a really good friend
back in junior high.

461
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,786
Oh, you actually had one.

462
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,723
I haven't contacted her in a while...

463
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,748
I wonder what she's
been up to lately?

464
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,963
She had written in the junior
high graduation literature book

465
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,732
that her dream was
to become a Mage...

466
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,892
In the end, birds of a feather
are flocking together?!

467
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,167
Lucky Star!

468
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,195
Lucky Channel!

469
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,274
Morning Luckies!

470
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,177
Now Lucky Channel has finally begun!

471
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,913
We're on TV now! All right!

472
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,981
Hello to all the people seeing me
for the first time on TV!

473
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,784
I'm Akira Kogami, your navigator!

474
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,547
Oh... and I'm Shiraishi.

475
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:49,988
Who?

476
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,290
A joke! Just kidding!

477
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,594
This is Minoru Shiraishi-san, who
will be helping me out from now on!

478
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,895
Ta-da-da-da!

479
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,331
Oh, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi,

480
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,334
and I will be the assistant
for Akira-sama...

481
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,268
Nice to see you.

482
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,004
Oh? You're a bit tense, Shiraishi-san?

483
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,574
Come on, you're finally on TV now,

484
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,709
loosen up a bit more! Just kidding!

485
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,477
I'm sorry, I'm just not used to this.

486
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,947
Now, I know this is early,
but we already have

487
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,848
letters of congratulation
from our viewers!

488
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,684
Oh, yes... well...

489
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,987
A letter from "I Love
Berry-Kou" in Osaka.

490
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,823
Congratulations on the TV
debut of Lucky Channel!

491
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,891
That's a thank you!

492
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,360
By the way, I have
a question for Akira.

493
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,396
Akira, you're recognized as
a super-idol by yourself and others,

494
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,632
but how much money
does an idol earn?

495
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,963
Please tell me.

496
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,271
How much money?

497
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,203
Yes.

498
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,742
Kind of a personal question here.

499
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,512
You know... What's the point of
asking me something like that?

500
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,647
Akira-sama?

501
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,250
Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.

502
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,517
Honestly, it really depends.

503
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,286
There are some events
that are really cheap,

504
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,289
but since I'm still getting a set
amount from my production company,

505
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,259
I don't know how much they're
deducting for company profit at all.

506
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,594
On top of that, I've been in this
business since I was three,

507
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,297
so all my earnings still get deposited
into my parents' bank account.

508
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:10,302
I only get a small allowance
from them. And it's really small.

509
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,336
Hey, come to think of it,

510
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,905
Mama's been buying pricey
brand-name bags left and right lately.

511
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,308
Maybe that was the money
I earned from this TV show?

512
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,909
You're freakin' kidding me!

513
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:18,777
- Am I Cinderella or something?!

514
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,678
- Wait a minute!
- Am I Cinderella or something?!

515
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:19,878
- Wait a minute!
- Just because Dad stopped sending

516
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,779
- Just because Dad stopped sending

517
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,613
- living expenses ever since
they got separated,

518
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,381
- Well, uh, you really don't need
to go that far in describing...
- living expenses ever since
they got separated,

519
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,406
- Well, uh, you really don't need
to go that far in describing...
- she shouldn't be totally
relying on me for money!

520
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,587
Oh, no, it's time for us
to say goodbye!

521
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,322
Akira's so lonely!

522
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,990
And so, in this segment,

523
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,293
please send all sorts of
questions and praise to me,

524
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,729
as well as opinions you have
about the show as a whole!

525
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,865
A word from you as well,
Shiraishi-san, please!

526
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,302
Oh... then, I hope you will see us
again in the next episode.

527
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,826
See ya!

528
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,807
That's right... Are you serious about
getting a part in the main show?

529
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,934
Oh, where did you hear about that?

530
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,380
Going to karaoke with
four people is unusual.

531
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,417
I hardly ever come to places like this.

532
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,887
Come on, we only have two hours,
so all of you, sing up a ton!

533
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,522
You don't have to be so enthusiastic.

534
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,790
We have plenty of time!

535
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,326
You know, this makes my heart race.

536
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,994
It's so much fun.

537
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,862
And when you sing, you end up
with such a clear conscience...

538
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,331
Hey, where's the catalog?

539
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:12,964
- Catalog?

540
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:13,432
- Yeah, the catalog.
- Catalog?

541
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,333
- Yeah, the catalog.

542
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,367
The catalog?

543
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,602
You know, the one that
lists all the song numbers.

544
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,338
Oh, you mean this? Here.

545
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,872
Then I'll go first!

546
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,142
That was fast... Wait, you already
entered three songs?!

547
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,576
It's such a waste of time if you
don't put in tons of songs!

548
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,414
Test, test, test.

549
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,049
What song is this?

550
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,752
Space Iron-Men Kyoudain!

551
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,721
You just have to start off
with this one!

552
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,488
I don't know this one...

553
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,422
Da da dadadada on planet Dada
I don't know this one...

554
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,990
Da da dadadada on planet Dada
Go for it, Kona-chan!

555
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,758
Da da dadadada on planet Dada
Konata, that's too loud!

556
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,426
A robot army to take over the Earth
Konata, that's too loud!

557
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,461
A robot army to take over the Earth

558
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:42,961
A robot army to take over the Earth
I'm telling you,
turn down the volume!

559
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,363
Fly, fly, Skybill the older brother
I'm telling you,
turn down the volume!

560
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,931
Fly, fly, Skybill the older brother

561
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,533
Fly, fly, Skybill the older brother
How the hell does she
know a song like this?

562
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,634
Fly, fly, Skybill the older brother

563
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:56,441
Run, Granzel the younger brother

564
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,845
Metal arm scrums against another arm

565
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:06,585
Sparks of giant galaxies flash

566
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,888
Go, go, jet! Go, go, car!

567
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:16,817
Space Iron-Men Kyoudain!

Konata here! Sleepy!

571
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,506
Konata here! Sleepy!

572
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,941
Why is it that on the nights
that you slept so much,

573
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,577
you're especially sleepy
in the morning?

574
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,046
It kinda defeats the purpose
of getting a good night's sleep.
