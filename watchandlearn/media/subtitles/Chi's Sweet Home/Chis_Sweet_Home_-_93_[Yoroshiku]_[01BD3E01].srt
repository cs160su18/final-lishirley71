00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,130
It's Blackie!

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,320
Where are you going?

4
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,180
Are you going to wander aimlessly again?

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,160
Wander aimlessly?

6
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,980
Chi will go too!

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,580
Don't follow me.

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,460
Where are you going?

9
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,680
Huh?

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,440
Mom, where's Chi?

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,200
She's not here?

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,220
What?!

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,650
Oh, no!

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,450
I forgot to push it completely closed!

15
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,290
She couldn't have gone outside?

16
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,750
She's not here.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,800
What should I do?!

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,770
If someone sees her, it'll be bad!

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,370
I need to look for her!

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,750
Oh?

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,120
Coming!

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,730
There we go.

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,680
There we go.

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,440
Hey, hey, what are you going to do?

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,940
If you're going to follow me, keep quiet.

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,440
Okay.

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,470
Good things!

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,830
Don't get side-tracked.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,420
That's the story.

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm asking every household whether cats have caused any damage.

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,180
Is that so?

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,860
Don't do anything unnecessary!

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,990
It smells good!

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
Let's hurry and go back.

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,260
Chi too!

36
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,160
Hot!

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,910
Take this, and this, and this!

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,260
What are you doing?

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,420
Hurry up!

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,910
Would you like some tea?

41
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,920
Oh, if you don't mind...

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,430
Hurry! Run!

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,460
Take this, and this, and this!

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,460
I was actually just thinking about having lunch...

45
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,110
Hello!
