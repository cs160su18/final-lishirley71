00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,510
I wonder if Chi will be okay.

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,160
Did we put away those knives?

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,880
We put them away.

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,930
What about the vase?

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,420
What about the bath lid?

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,100
We put everything away that could hurt her or get broken.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,450
What about the door to my room?

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,830
It's okay. It's closed.

10
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,980
Let's go quickly!

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,500
What's that?

12
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,630
You attacked me by surprise, so take this!

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,140
Chi took it down!

14
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,320
Outside!

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,500
Outside! Outside!

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,130
Outside!

17
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,670
Outside! Outside!

18
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,210
Outside!

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Huh?!

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,570
What is this thing?!

21
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,820
What is it?!

22
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,940
H-How's that?

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,870
HUH?!

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,870
I-It's hopeless...

25
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,880
H-E-L-P ME!

26
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,880
I wonder if Chi is okay.

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,200
She's fine.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,470
That's right.

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,390
Somebody...

30
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,940
Somebody help me!
