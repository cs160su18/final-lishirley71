00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,290
Blackie's gone.

3
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,250
He disappeared.

4
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,280
No!

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,140
No no no!

6
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,200
No!

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,400
No!

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
I don't like it!

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,900
It oinked!

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,110
It went "swee"!

11
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,560
It reinflated?

12
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,540
It's smiling!

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,610
What are you doing there?

14
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,080
The little ducks are waiting!

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,780
The big duck is over there!

16
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,280
It's over there!

17
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,290
Huh?

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,400
Huh?

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,590
Oh?

20
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,260
You can't see her, but she's there!

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,980
Chi, what's the matter?

22
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,870
Youhei! Mom! Dad!

23
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,300
Chi?

24
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,480
He's there!

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,730
Blackie's there!

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,720
It looks like Chi's finally feeling better!

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,380
That's great.

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,410
I can't see him, but...

29
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,770
He's there!
