00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,310
Thanks for inviting me.

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,010
No, not at all.

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,590
Let's hide here, okay?

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,350
Oh! What I wanted to talk to you about...

6
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,820
is a cat.

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,810
A cat?!

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,440
Yes...

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,020
Huh?

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,350
Propping your screen door?

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,070
Th-That's because...

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,070
Is it because of that cat?

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,010
So, just as I thought.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,240
That bear cat enters your house too, doesn't it?

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,750
Bear cat?

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,060
Suzuki-san is also propping his door.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,380
He says that the bear cat enters by opening the screen door.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,990
O-Oh, is that so?

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,010
We're safe.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,240
This is fun!

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,030
No, stop it, Chi.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,890
Huh?

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,900
I wonder what that is.

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,230
U-Umm, Youhei is cleaning the bathroom.

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,900
Huh?

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,810
Right, right, his favorite thing now is cleaning.

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,910
K-Kids are mysterious.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,280
Really, they are mysterious.

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,910
This is nice.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,040
Chi!

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,960
He's quite enthusiastic.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
Umm, could you tell me the rest?

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, yes!

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,080
Rumor says that someone in this apartment complex is keeping that bear cat.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,830
Do you know anything about it?

36
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,300
No.

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,300
Nothing.

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,540
No!

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,770
Hush.

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,490
Thanks for the tea.

41
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,770
If you hear anything, tell me.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,280
Youhei-kun, are you all right?

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
There is...

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,110
She found it.

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,180
This is bad.

46
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,250
So you're cleaning the walls too, Youhei-kun.

47
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,610
You really are an impressive boy.

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,210
Well, see you.

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,640
We're safe.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,770
Chi, there you go.

51
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,800
Yay!

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,460
This is fun.
