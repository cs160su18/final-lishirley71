00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,420
Chi, where are you?

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,260
Chi.

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,340
Chi?

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,080
Chi.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,260
I wonder where she went.

7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,520
Did she...

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
go out?

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,200
I couldn't get a souvenir.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,000
There'll be other chances.

11
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,660
What's this?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
It's my territory...

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
Get out of my territory!

14
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,780
Geez.

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,480
My car!

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,730
Run!

17
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,530
Wait!

18
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,710
Hey!

19
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,330
Where did she go?

20
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,290
Is she all right?

21
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,700
Did she get lost?

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,050
There are cars and other dangers outside.

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,110
There are scary dogs...

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Chi!

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Dad, I'm home!

26
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,950
Where on earth have you been?

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,910
You made me worry.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,680
That black bear of a cat!

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,680
Was it here again?

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,560
Yeah.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
It ran away in that direction.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,970
It's a black cat.

33
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,440
And there was another.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,610
A small cat was with it.

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,990
I wonder if it's still around here.

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,990
Those two ran in that direction.

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,430
Let's definitely find them.

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,450
Right.

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's find them.

40
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,140
What did it do?

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,050
It peed on my car.

42
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,150
Oh my.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,120
Come to think of it, that happened to someone else a while ago.

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,650
We're saved.

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,430
See ya.

46
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,770
Let's get a souvenir next time.

47
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,100
Yeah!

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,250
See you again!
