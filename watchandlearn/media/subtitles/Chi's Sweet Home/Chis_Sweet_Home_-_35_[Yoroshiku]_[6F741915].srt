2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,000
Outside!

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,160
Just a little bit more!

4
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,820
I got up!

5
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,820
I can see!

6
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,240
I can see!

7
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,960
I can see outside!

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,340
No!

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,350
You'll be found!

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,780
We're probably safe.

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,430
I didn't think she'd be able to get up on the bay window.

12
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,110
It's only a matter of time until she's found.

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,350
What should we do?

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,150
If it's come to this, I'll have to prevent you from going into Dad's room.

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,760
Okay?

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,610
No more going into Dad's room.

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,110
Open it!

18
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,460
No way!

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,080
Cats are forbidden!

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,580
I could see outside!

21
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,200
I said no!

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,380
I could see. Open it!

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,170
Open it!

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,730
No way!

25
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,420
I'm home.

26
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,000
Welcome home.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,210
Where's Mom?

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,390
Shopping.

29
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,390
Where's Chi?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,490
So she could sit on the bay window?

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,000
It's because she's not allowed in Dad's room.

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,980
Oh well, it can't be helped.

33
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,040
What's that?

34
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,540
Ah, this?

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,290
It was an impulse buy.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,750
It's really cute.

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,720
What's that?!

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,720
Hey, Chi.

39
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,530
Boring!

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,560
Oh, no! She's really stubborn.
