00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,510
Chi...

3
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,760
Oh, that's nice.

4
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,260
I think I'll be able to take a cute photo.

5
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,770
You don't need to come here.

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,060
What's this?

7
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,650
Not that...

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,030
Okay, Chi.

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,340
Just like that, just like that.

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,320
Huh?

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,320
This pose is good too.

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,700
Just the tail.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,420
Dad, it's prey!

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,410
I'll capture this facial expression.

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,180
I'm home!

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,750
Did you take a photo?

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,560
A photo?

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,000
Remember how Juri-chan in Hokkaido said she wanted us to send her a photo of Chi?

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,060
Show me!

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,620
Huh?

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,070
What's this?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,070
The little black thing on the bottom is Chi's shadow.

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,770
You should capture Chi.

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,580
When I try to take her picture, she runs away.

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,880
Huh?

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,080
They ran away.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,790
That's it!

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,050
Youhei, it's up to you.

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,600
Huh?

30
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,190
Daddy, like this?

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,420
Is this okay?

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
Cute!

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,800
This is great!

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,960
Oh, my...

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,430
Chi...

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,490
Youhei, what are you doing?

37
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,470
Chi, over there, over there.

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,190
Huh?

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,690
Not there, over there, Chi!

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Here!

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,700
Huh?

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,080
Leave this kind of thing to me.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,080
Chi, you're cute.

46
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,080
Here's my chance!

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,430
This is the only one I could get of her face.

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,050
That surprised me.
