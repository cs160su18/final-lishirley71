00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,480
Chi?

3
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,890
You surprised me!

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,930
Run!

5
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,900
Huh?

6
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,370
Youhei isn't here.

7
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,870
Chi.

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,720
Chi, what are you doing?

9
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,550
I see! You're playing hide and seek, right?

10
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,600
This is fun!

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,820
Chi.

12
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,890
Huh?

13
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,270
Chi.

14
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,080
Boo!

15
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,590
I found you!

16
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,880
Hide!

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,190
Where should I hide?

18
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,760
Where should I hide?

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,800
A place to hide...

20
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,810
This is it!

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,830
I won't be found if I'm in here.

22
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,160
I win this game of hide-and-seek.

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,120
I found you, Chi.

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,260
I've been found.

25
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,240
Chi.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Where is he? Where is he?

27
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,240
Where is Youhei?

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,620
I found you, Youhei!

29
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,010
I've been found.

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,830
Hide-and-seek is fun!
