00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,050
This is cool! This is cool!

3
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,310
That's right, it's a kitten.

4
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,700
Is that so...

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,020
No, thanks anyway.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,770
No good, huh?

7
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,520
I can't think of any other places to call.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,860
Yeah, we shouldn't abandon Chi at this point, but...

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,070
I'll catch it again!

10
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,530
But cats and dogs are prohibited in this apartment.

11
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,870
Ah! I hadn't called this person yet!

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,180
This is Yamada. We went to the community seminar together.

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,380
Yes, the truth is...

14
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,010
Eh?! Really?!

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,980
What is it?

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,230
What's the matter?

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,680
Okay, talk to you later.

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,250
Is it really true?

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,770
They said they wanted a kitten. They'd been looking for one.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,010
What?

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,470
What? What?

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,980
But, it makes me sad.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,910
They said they'll come to see Chi soon...

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,900
I see.

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,030
S-So cute!

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,420
What, what?!

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,030
It's a good kitty, it can even go to the toilet properly.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,240
It knows its own name too.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,750
Chi.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,460
Who is this?!

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,840
It seems to be a little nervous, eh.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,920
A stranger came around, so maybe it's surprised?

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,590
Th-That surprised me!

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Usually it's affectionate with people.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,130
Yeah. Chi-chan is really cute!

36
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,440
By all means I'd like it to be mine.

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,730
Eh?

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
Thank goodness.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,860
That's a relief.

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,260
Ah, but this comes after talking with my husband,

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,750
and it was actually my husband who said, "I want to have a cat."

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,280
Well then, I'll call this evening.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,870
Okay.

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
See you, Chi-chan.

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,990
I'll see you soon too, Youhei-kun.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,960
Well then, I'll be on my way.

47
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,850
Hey.

48
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,100
Is Chi going to that lady's house?

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,390
Eh?

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,990
What's wrong, everybody?
