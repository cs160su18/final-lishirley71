00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,000
What's this?

3
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,470
H-Hey, Chi.

4
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,570
Are you okay?

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,540
Yeah.

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,830
I'll figure something out.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,480
So take Youhei.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,630
Well then, we're off.

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll be back.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,290
Have a safe trip.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,980
Now then, Chi-chan.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,150
And then you know...

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,220
Good morning.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,630
Good morning.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,270
Ah, good morning.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,490
Have a safe trip.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,790
And you know, it really looked like one.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,990
What did?

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,490
Chi, let go.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,410
Listen, Chi.

21
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,050
Pets are forbidden in this apartment complex.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,050
It'll be a world of trouble if you're found.

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,010
Wait!

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,230
Wait! Wait!

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,370
Huh?

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,230
Where did it go?

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Good morning, Yamada-san.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,990
Good morning.

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,030
Say, have you heard?

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,000
About what?

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,800
It seems someone is keeping a cat in this apartment complex.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,290
Eek.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,720
What should I do?

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,050
We've been exposed!

35
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,890
I heard that it came along the veranda.

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,550
A cat this big.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Eh?

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,050
A big one?

39
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,890
That's right.

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,870
A cat this big.

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,750
That big?

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,060
Surprising, isn't it?

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,060
Safe.

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,560
I didn't know.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,150
Since cats are forbidden in this apartment complex, right?

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,270
Right.

47
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,900
Oh my, what's wrong?

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,760
Umm, just a little something...

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,040
You look pale.

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,560
Ah, that's right!

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,510
I left a pan on the stove.

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,960
See you later.

53
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,170
Mom, this is amazing!

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,210
You can see outside!

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,970
Safe.

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,060
You can't do that, Chi.

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,000
If you're found, it'll be a world of trouble.

58
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,230
Outside!

59
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,510
Outside! Outside!

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,940
Outside!
