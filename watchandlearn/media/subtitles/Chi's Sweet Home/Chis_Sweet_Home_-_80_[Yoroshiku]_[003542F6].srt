00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,050
Hide and seek with Chi?

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,690
Yes...

4
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,640
I wonder where Chi is hiding.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,020
We'll soon find her if we all look together.

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,200
Huh?

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,790
Where am I?

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,070
I wonder what I was doing.

9
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,110
Umm...

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,030
Yes! It's hide and seek!

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,880
Youhei still hasn't found me.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,680
Huh?

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,080
It's different from a while ago.

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,540
What's going on?

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,410
What?!

16
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,240
I can't get through!

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,590
I won this game!

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,240
Chi isn't anywhere.

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,830
It's going to be all right.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,950
Let's think about this calmly.

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,860
Yeah.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,310
Places that Chi likes...

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,820
Enclosed places like boxes or bags...

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,590
Behind doors or under laundry...

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,230
She likes narrow gaps like this.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,200
Anyway, let's search some more.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,120
Chi?

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,400
Chi.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,580
Chi!

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,570
I'm hungry.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,230
We really couldn't find Chi.

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,930
What should we do?

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,540
Let's think about it some more.

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,240
Places like boxes.

35
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,310
Gaps this narrow...

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,190
Oh!

37
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,440
Could...

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,690
that...

39
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,070
be...

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,490
Eh?

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,150
I don't like it!

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,010
I want to lose!

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,750
I want to lose!

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,630
Huh?

45
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,960
There you are!

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,400
I've been found!

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,170
Chi's great at hide and seek.

48
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,150
Sorry for forgetting you, Chi.

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,350
You win at hide and seek, Youhei!

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,890
I lost.
