00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,760
Dad, what's that?

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,700
This?

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,520
It's a board for Chi to sharpen her claws on.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,400
What do you think, Chi?

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,860
What's that?!

7
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,360
If you use this, you can sharpen your claws as much as you want.

8
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,440
Do you like it, Chi?

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,360
What?

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,490
This is cool!

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,630
Why doesn't Chi use the stuff we buy, no matter what it is?

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,090
I think all we can do is to teach her patiently.

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,710
This really is cool!

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,460
Chi.

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,210
Not that.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,710
This.

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,690
Look.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
What's this?

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,300
That's right.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,270
That's where you sharpen your claws.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,410
This is a nice bed!

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,610
Chi's playing.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,240
Chi.

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,520
Look.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,970
Watch me.

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,740
Put up your nails like this.

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,250
And this way you can sharpen your own claws.

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,890
There.

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,160
You try it too, Chi.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,840
Chi's not sharpening them.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,760
Clean! Clean!

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
Not that.

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,760
Look.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,850
Like this...

35
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,850
And then...

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,150
you do this.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,310
What are you doing?

38
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,250
Okay, you understand now, right?

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,180
Chi's paw...

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,410
Dad squeezed...

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,820
Ouch!

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,350
Oh my.

43
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,900
She got you.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,450
She got mad at me.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,920
Chi's still mad.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,830
What should I do?

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,130
Somehow or other, we need to trim Chi's claws.

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,430
Dad, would you please do that?

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,220
Eh?

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,300
Well...

51
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,150
I'll give it my best and see how it goes.

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,630
I wonder if Chi will let me trim her claws quietly...
