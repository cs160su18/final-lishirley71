00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,130
Chi.

3
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,270
For your sake, we're going for a health checkup.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,970
That's right.

5
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,150
Be a good kitten, Chi.

6
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,310
What's going on?

7
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,500
Well then, we're counting on you.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,030
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,290
I'll be going to the animal hospital as fast as possible.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,400
Hello.

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,980
L-Landlady!

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,490
What are you doing together like this?

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,820
Are you on your way out?

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,530
W-Well, you could say so.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,120
No. It's just Dad who's leaving for work.

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,140
Oh, is that so?

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,840
Lovely weather we're having.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,760
You could say it's an ideal day for working...

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,090
Yes.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,030
But it's going to get cloudy this afternoon.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,630
Is that so?

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,140
Then perhaps I should bring in the laundry.

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,600
That's right.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,920
It would be a bother if the dry laundry got wet again.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,380
I should bring those in too.

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,500
W-Well then, I should be on my way.

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,420
Have a safe trip.

28
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,000
And then-

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,340
I just heard a cat crying...

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,290
I wonder where it is?

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,330
It sounded like it was very close.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,710
Somebody might be keeping one here!

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,170
It's all over...

34
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,720
We'll be driven out of our home.

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,720
What should I do?

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,340
Oh! It was Youhei?

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,370
I thought it was a real cat!

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,340
D-Dear, your customers are waiting.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,940
Eh?

40
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,490
Ah! That's right, my business.

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,750
Well then, excuse me.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,750
Sorry for interrupting you.

43
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,180
We're safe.

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,700
Let me out!

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,740
Will we be all right from here on?
