00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,550
Hmm?

3
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,550
I wonder what that is?

4
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,510
Oh my!

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,480
Youhei!

6
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,690
Youhei!

7
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,230
What?

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,400
You left these in your trouser pockets.

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,410
Put them away properly.

10
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,570
Okay!

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,910
Youhei, let's play!

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,830
Chi?

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Huh?

14
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,270
Ugh, it got away.

15
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,610
Aw, it went in.

16
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,530
Ball!

17
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,950
Ball!

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,320
Gimme!

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,120
Hey, gimme!

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,910
Gimme!

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,750
Ouch!

22
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Amazing!

23
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,810
Wait!

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,060
Wait! Wait!

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,810
Wait!

26
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,740
What's that sound?

27
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,870
This is quite a ruckus.

28
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,790
Hurry and clean up the super balls!

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay!

30
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,930
Making the place this untidy...

31
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,520
Chi is dangerous with a super ball.

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,850
Ball! Ball!

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,980
That's true.

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,070
This is fun! This is fun!

35
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,240
Chi?

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,900
I heard that your manga's about to come out!

37
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,950
Chi's book?

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,290
The latest comic, volume 5 and "Neko-moto nya."

39
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,090
On sale Wednesday this week!

40
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm happy!

41
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,930
I'll be waiting at bookstores all over Japan!

42
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,050
Koudansha!
