00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,220
Dad, these are cool!

3
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,230
After the animal hospital, Chi wouldn't ever come near me, but...

4
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,080
now Chi is so tame.

5
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,850
B-But, these jeans are expensive.

6
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,730
They're vintage!

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,940
I'd finally bought them!

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,240
Ah, what should I do?

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,050
It's all right, isn't it?

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,090
One pair of tattered jeans.

11
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,750
It's not all right!

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,750
Sorry, Chi.

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,810
What's up with Dad?

14
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,000
Who knows?

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,760
Oh my...

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,260
How about these, Chi?

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,760
If you use these jeans, then...

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,100
you can scratch them as much as you like.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,280
Not these.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,820
Huh?

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,140
Apparently she only likes the jeans from before.

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,910
But...

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,820
Ah!

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,330
No!

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,710
Chi, the sofa is a no-no!

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,620
Goodness me.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,260
I wanna scratch.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,210
Ah!

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,760
Not that.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,310
Dad, let go!

31
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,020
Let go!

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,260
Mum and Dad are getting in Chi's way!

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,130
Chi seems to be sulking.

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,980
But it'll cause problems if she leaves scratches here and there.

35
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,170
That's it!

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,530
So you're looking for a kitty scratching post.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,630
We have some made of cardboard that are long and slender or round.

38
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,780
And some that are covered with cloth or carpet.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,680
Also some thin mats, shaped like a house or a doll.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,940
What were you looking for today?

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,540
The most common one please.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay!

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,810
Thank you for your continued patronage.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,710
Chi!

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,690
Hold out just a little bit longer.

46
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,220
I'll be home soon.

47
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,290
Huh?

48
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,170
Chi!

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,570
Dad's vintage jeans!

50
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,270
Just as I thought, these are cool.
