00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,460
Hide-and-seek!

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,180
Are you ready?

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,930
Huh?

5
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,980
Are you ready?

6
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,730
Where is it?

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,690
Where is a place I won't be found?

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,160
Found it!

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,700
You're ready, right?

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,070
Where is Chi?

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,410
Is she here?

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,790
Is she here?

13
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,790
Huh? Where is she?

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,440
Is she here?

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,570
What? She isn't here.

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,420
Huh!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,830
I've got it! You must be there!

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,690
Huh?

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,110
She isn't here either.

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,700
Yay!

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,770
I wonder where she is.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm home.

23
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,560
Mom, welcome back.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,210
Your snack today is pudding.

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,110
Pudding?

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,880
After you eat it, brush your teeth and take a nap.

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,300
Okay.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
Youhei hasn't come.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,020
I win.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,970
I win.

31
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,750
Oh, I forgot to close it.

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,510
Huh?

33
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,160
Hey, do you know where Chi is?

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,370
Chi?

35
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,490
I forgot.

36
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,430
I win...
