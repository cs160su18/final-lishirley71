00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,560
Ah, this is great.

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,430
It really is delicious.

4
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,500
A yummy thing?

5
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,610
Yuck!

6
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,070
A yummy thing?

7
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,280
Not yummy...

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,990
You shouldn't do that, Chi.

9
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,700
This isn't your dinner.

10
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,460
A yummy thing...

11
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,850
A yummy thing...

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,450
Ah, not again.

13
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,720
This isn't your dinner.

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,020
Chi's food tastes the best.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,540
Youhei, your snack is ready.

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,000
Huh?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,420
That's a nice smell!

18
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,780
I put plenty of butter on it.

19
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,180
It looks delicious!

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,940
Let's eat!

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,890
Is it yummy?

22
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,400
Youhei.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,370
If Chi wants some hot cake, only give her a little bit.

24
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,000
Is it delicious, Chi?

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,970
Yummy!

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,490
I can't believe something this yummy exists!

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Huh?

28
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,600
That's mean, Chi.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,150
Yummy!
