Here, here, Yamada-san!

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,340
Eh?

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,050
Hey, did you see, did you?

5
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,360
See? The second floor...

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,560
That's what they get for keeping a cat!

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,630
Apparently, there was no way they could give it up.

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,960
They decided to move.

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,850
Moving?!

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,010
That's right!

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,900
They were just loading their boxes.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Surprising...

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
It's so sudden, after all.

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,240
What's everyone doing?

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,840
The black bear cat's family chose their cat over their house, didn't they?

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,560
Yeah...

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,610
That's right.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,920
Outside!

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,650
I'm so sorry.

20
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,170
As the landlady, I had no choice.

21
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,840
No, same here.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
We're sorry.

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,080
Well then, take care.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,370
Oh!

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,070
You were keeping two cats, right?

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,080
Where's the kitten?

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,900
We only have this black cat.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,710
Eh?!

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,080
Ah, then, that kitten?

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,800
Then, excuse us.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,170
Thanks.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,520
It's Blackie!

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,020
Hey! Hey!

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Where will that black bear cat go?

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,220
A faraway place?

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,410
I wonder.

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,760
Chi won't be able to see the black bear cat anymore?

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,040
They were getting along so well.

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,340
Oh!

40
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,090
What an amazing way to go out!

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,140
See you later!

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,150
See you later!

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,540
See you later!

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,740
See you later!
