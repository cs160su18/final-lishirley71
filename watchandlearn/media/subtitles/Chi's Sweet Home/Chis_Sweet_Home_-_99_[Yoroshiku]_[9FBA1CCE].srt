00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Chi...

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,660
I want to play with Blackie.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,810
Outside...

5
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,320
Chi...

6
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,950
Chi wants to go out so much.

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,320
But she has to be kept in the house.

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,540
We're just trying to hide her so she doesn't get caught.

9
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,780
Isn't that different from when she got out so suddenly?

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,690
Also, Chi already knows about the outside world.

11
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,380
That's true, but...

12
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,680
I wonder if it's okay this way.

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,180
Then what do you suggest we do?!

14
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,500
What to do?

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,420
Should we have Juri-chan take her to Hokkaido?

16
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't know.

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
I just don't know.

18
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,300
But...

19
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,180
we need to decide...

20
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,490
what would be best for Chi's happiness.

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,880
Chi...

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,130
So you're still here?

23
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,640
Chi...

24
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,230
Outside...
