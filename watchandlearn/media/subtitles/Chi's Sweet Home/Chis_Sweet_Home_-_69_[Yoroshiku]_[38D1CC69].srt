00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,070
Huh?

3
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,930
There, it's milk.

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,870
Milk?

5
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,940
Is it all right to give a cat milk?

6
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,960
It's all right if it's not that much.

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,190
Yummy!

8
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,190
I want some more!

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,300
Thanks for the meal.

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,370
Huh?

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,890
Milk!

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,220
What should I do?

13
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,880
Youhei.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,980
Which one do you want for your snack?

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,200
This one.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,090
Wait a second.

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,920
Mom, could you get milk for me?!

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,760
Please give it to me!

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,060
Mom, hurry.

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,720
Yes, yes.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,510
Huh?

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,770
Where's my milk?

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,770
Yay!

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,240
Oh!

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,240
Oh, my.

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,950
Chi, you are clever.

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,190
I brought my plate.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,950
Could you pour some milk?

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,870
Yes, yes.

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,410
Milk.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,200
Huh?

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,790
You like crunchies a lot, right?

33
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,130
Good for you.

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,210
This isn't it.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,180
I'm home.

36
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,370
Oh!

37
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,350
I-I-I-It's milk!

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,860
Mom, I definitely want milk.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
I'll give you that.

40
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,670
Milk!

41
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,500
Huh?

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,570
Huh?

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,040
You like plastic bags a lot, don't you?

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,080
No!

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,940
This isn't it!

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,460
I want milk!

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,260
Anyone else want to drink milk?

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,950
Yes!

49
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,680
Me too.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,710
This is nice!

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,340
Hey Chi. Don't you want to drink?

52
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,850
What's this? What's this?

53
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,300
She's so absorbed in playing, she can't hear you.
