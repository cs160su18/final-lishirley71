00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,150
Hey, is Chi going to the vet?

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,780
It's time for her vaccinations.

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,020
She has to be injected so she won't get ill.

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,600
Youhei, let's play!

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,820
S-Scary.

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,490
No!

9
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,650
Ah! Chi!

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,660
Safety check before going out.

11
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,400
Yay!

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,800
The landlady is...

13
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,610
If now's the time, then...

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,230
Do your best.

15
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,890
All right.

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,640
Oh my, Yamada-san.

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,440
On your way out in such a hurry?

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,220
Ah, no.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,400
It's not that, umm...

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,480
Oh my.

21
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,830
Huh?

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,780
I was just wandering around here,

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,500
and I thought, "The trees and grass are pretty."

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,670
I agree that the foliage is nice.

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,450
This is cool!

26
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,160
Well, then...

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,620
What is it?

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,890
L-Lovely weather today, isn't it?

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,020
That's true.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,720
Well, then...

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,600
Is there something else?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,980
Umm, well, err, umm...

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,440
It's nothing.

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,690
Well, then...

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,320
I-It's over!

36
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,910
Ah!

37
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,460
Ah! That cat!

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,120
Hey! Wait!

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,340
Wait right there!

40
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,500
We're saved.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,290
We were saved by that black bear of a cat, of all things.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,320
Amazing!

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,050
The black one caught something good.

44
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,860
Huh?

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,010
What was Chi doing?

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,970
I wonder what it was?

47
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,520
Gotcha.

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,370
Huh?

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,590
I wonder what it was?
