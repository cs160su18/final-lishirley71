00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,060
It's a souvenir.

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,470
Open it and see.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,970
Oh, wow!

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,300
I'm scared to hold it.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
What, what!

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,310
Chi.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,810
Huh?

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,570
It's weird!

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,160
A crab.

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,570
Huh?

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,080
A-Amazing!

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,790
Juri-chan's amazing.

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,080
This is nothing.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,830
I feel like I'm going to lose...

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,090
Huh?

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,500
Here!

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,290
I won't lose!

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,440
Juri-chan...

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,450
Don't surprise Chi so much, okay?

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:27,900
Okay.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,690
There.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,360
Chi!

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,070
Come here!

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,820
She's on a rampage.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,380
I need to be careful.

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,830
What are you doing?!

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,830
Juri-chan, what are you doing?

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,330
Animals like it when you pet around their necks.

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,590
Is that so?

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,520
See?

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,700
Our horse and dog say it feels good too!

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,590
Eh?

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,820
Thank goodness.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,390
It was just petting.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,600
Chi!

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
I have a way to make you even happier!

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,310
What are you doing?!

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,610
There, there, there, there.

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,230
There!

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,610
What are you doing?!

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,800
Chi, you're cute!

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,610
There, there, there.

44
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,610
Juri-chan, stop.

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,540
There, there, there.

46
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,620
Our dog really likes this!

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,150
There!

48
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,430
See? She's happy!

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
Huh?

50
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Juri, you can't be rough with Chi-chan.

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,320
She's just a kitten.

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
Chi?

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,180
That was fun!
