00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,810
What?

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,050
Humans are not comrades.

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,140
Yeah, they're not comrades.

5
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,550
Yeah.

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,040
I knew it.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,790
See ya.

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,560
Huh?

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,800
Where are you going?

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,840
I'm going back home where my humans live.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,020
It's time for my meal.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,510
What?

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,530
Even if they're not comrades?

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,580
And everyone is waiting for me.

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,530
What?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,340
Well, it's something called a give-and-take relationship.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,840
What?

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,570
I'm back here just to have a meal.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,070
Yay! It's temaki sushi.

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,450
Oh, Chi!

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,280
You were a good girl, putting up with the injection.

23
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,280
Huh?

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,030
This is a reward.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,500
Do you want some?

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,060
Come here, Chi.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,200
There.

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,760
Chi, it's tuna.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,380
Huh?

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,580
I have fried egg.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
I have salmon roe.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,220
I prefer tuna first.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,120
This is mine.

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,750
It tastes good.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,740
Chi.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,150
Wasn't that nice?

37
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,410
Chi, it's nice, isn't it?

38
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,130
Chi, did you like it too?

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,380
It was nice, everyone.

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,180
So it tasted good to you as well?

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,990
Good for you, Chi.

42
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,000
If you'd like it, I'll be your comrade!
