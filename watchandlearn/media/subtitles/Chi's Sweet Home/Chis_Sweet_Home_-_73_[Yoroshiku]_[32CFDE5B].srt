00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,790
Huh?

3
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,420
Is this Chi's fur?

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,960
Chi, what's up?

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,340
Are you itchy?

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,140
Oh my, Dad.

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,280
What happened to your back?

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,140
Huh?

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,520
Huh?!

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,100
Well, there's a lot of fur.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,950
I guess it's her season to shed.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,950
Do we have to brush her?

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,650
Maybe.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,010
Huh?

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,790
I got some sweets as gifts, so I thought you might like some.

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,250
Thank you very much.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,530
Then can I come in?

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,130
Eh?

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,220
In?

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,750
U-Umm...

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,500
It's quite messy.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,640
I don't mind.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,930
U-U-Umm...

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,710
It'll be bad if she sees we have a cat.

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,490
Where should I hide Chi?

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,600
Dad, what are you doing?

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,130
Excuse me.

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,400
Oh?

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,190
W-Welcome.

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,900
Nice to see you.

31
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,400
Your house is in good order.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,490
Take a seat on the sofa.

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,830
You two take a seat, too.

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,050
This is really nice.

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,580
I'm on a diet.

36
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,830
Why, surely you can have one?

37
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,670
Yes, of course.

38
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,210
Oh! What a beautiful bird.

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,460
Eh?

40
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,840
Look there.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,550
Eh? Where?

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,760
Can't you see it?

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't see any bird.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,170
Good morning.

45
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,520
Youhei, take care of her.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Eh?

47
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,020
This is really nice.

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,110
Thanks.

49
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,030
Oh! I forgot to make some tea.

50
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,540
Hush.

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,070
Thank you for the sweets.

52
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,270
Well, say hello to Youhei-chan.

53
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,940
U-Umm...

54
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,310
Eh?

55
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,450
Chi's fur...

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,580
Th-There's some dust...

57
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't care.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,380
These are my everyday clothes.

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,910
It won't take long.

60
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,920
I wonder if she noticed Chi.

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,980
I assume it's okay.

62
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,990
But we have to do something about this fur.
