2
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,960
Dad sure is late.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Even though I have to go shopping for dinner soon.

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,190
Youhei.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
What is it?

6
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,190
I think Dad will be home soon, so be a good boy with Chi until then.

7
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,170
Okay!

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,870
Well then...

9
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,700
I'm off.

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,700
Ch-Chi...

11
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,340
A walk?

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,400
Going out?

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,710
Chi go!

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,260
Chi is house-sitting with me.

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,360
Do you understand?

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,340
Okay?

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,880
Let's go out!

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,370
Ch-Chi.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,210
I can't go shopping like this.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,190
Chi, dinner time.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,400
Let's eat!

22
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,750
It's a chance to...

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,790
You shouldn't do that, Chi.

24
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,890
This tactic doesn't work.

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm home!

26
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,880
Great timing!

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,910
What's wrong?

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,930
Well then, if you can go and get these.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,750
Yeah. The side dishes for dinner, right?

30
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,920
Take care of that for me.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,740
Have a safe trip!

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,480
Going out!

33
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,980
Now, now, Chi.

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,970
Thanks for your continued patronage.

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,300
Soba noodle shop here.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,750
In the end we couldn't go shopping.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,390
We have to teach Chi soon.

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,610
Teach her what?

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,410
House-sitting.

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,480
House-sitting?

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,420
I wonder if Chi will be okay alone...

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,290
Well, Chi seems to be getting used to this house.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm sure she'll be fine soon enough.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,800
That's right!

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,450
Let's do that!

46
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,060
All right.

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,530
Now that we've decided.

48
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,840
Next Sunday will be Chi's first house-sitting!

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,100
Yeah!

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
What?
