00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,150
Umm, excuse me.

3
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,930
Yes?

4
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,230
Where is the kitty litter?

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,740
Oh! Kitty litter, is it?!

6
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,340
Here! Right this way!

7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,210
This way!

8
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,230
Over here we have paper litter, cypress litter, soy pulp litter, gravel litter.

9
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,360
Litter you can put in the burnable garbage.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,490
Litter you can flush down the toilet.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,120
Clumping litter.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,290
Non-clumping litter.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,250
Odorless litter.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,180
Anti-bacterial litter.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,740
What were you looking for today?

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,710
S-So many varieties!

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,510
U-Umm...

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,210
Yes?

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,820
Umm.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,560
What should I buy?

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,290
This is your first time, isn't it?

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,040
That's right. It's bewildering, isn't it?

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,510
I was like that too.

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,720
First, tell me about how you're keeping it.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,060
Okay.

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,020
Litter you can flush down the toilet?

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,400
It's easier because it's flushable.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,390
After all, dogs and cats are prohibited in this apartment complex.

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,520
Ah, I see.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,540
And we can't put kitty litter in the garbage!

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,420
Yeah.

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,610
Huh?

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,740
Kitty, we bought something great, okay?

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,720
What?

35
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,540
Huh?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,920
My play bed got all lumpy!

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:56,870
Huh?

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,990
Huh?!

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,020
Yay!

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,140
Play! Play!

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,420
Gotta pee!

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,520
Ah!

43
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,450
It peed again in a place like this!

44
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,340
Pee! Pee!

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,710
You're supposed to pee in the toilet, right?

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,310
That's right.

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,660
Where are you going?

48
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,490
To kitty's toilet.

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,080
P-Pee in a place like this...

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,590
Even though it was my play bed!

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,980
Even though it was my play bed!
