00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,310
Okay then, Chi.

3
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,600
Aren't you a good girl?

4
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,510
Now stay calm.

5
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,430
Dad, what are you doing?

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,310
Let's see...

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,440
It says if you hold the root, the claw will emerge.

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,320
I've never clipped a cat's claws before.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,110
My heart is racing.

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,220
It's shining.

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,580
What's this?!

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,580
No! No!

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,080
Ah, Chi. Don't move.

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,960
No!

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,500
Let go!

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,540
What are you doing?!

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,630
Please stay still.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,390
What if you hold her tighter?

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,890
A-All right!

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,390
Give it your best, Dad!

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,400
I cut the transparent part on the end of this, right?

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,900
It says if you cut the colored part, it will bleed.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,290
Eh?

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,320
It will bleed?

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't do it!

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,170
I'm so scared that I can't clip them.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,260
Let me go!

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,700
Huh?

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,720
Chi, be quiet, okay?

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,230
What are you doing?!

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,970
Hooray!

32
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,480
You cut it well.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,520
Yeah.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,050
I finally cut one.

35
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,530
Ouch...

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,920
Only nine more to go...

37
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,990
That hurt...

38
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,500
It was rough, but we trimmed Chi's claws properly.

39
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,260
Isn't that great?

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,650
I wonder if she hates me again.

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,590
Chi!

42
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,840
Chi.

43
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,100
Let's make up.

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,840
I hate Dad!
