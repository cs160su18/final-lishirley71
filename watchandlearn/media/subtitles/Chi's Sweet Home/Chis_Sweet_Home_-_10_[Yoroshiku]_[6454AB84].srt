00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,630
You don't happen to know someone who could keep it, do you?

3
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,010
Hmm...

4
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,450
Mama! Mama!

5
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,840
Mama!

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,930
Mama!

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,430
Mama!

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,340
Mom!

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,780
Chi's sound asleep.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,650
Sure is.

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,780
Babies sleep well, don't they?

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,660
We can't keep Chi, but we can't seem to find someone to take it.

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
Now then, it's beddy-bye for you too, Youhei.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,720
Night night!

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,260
Yup, good night.

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,650
Mom! Let's sleep together!

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,880
Okay, okay.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,980
You still can't be by yourself?

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,750
Huh?

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,140
Huh?

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,940
Where's Mama?

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,280
I'm scared, Mama!

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm scared, Mama!

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,200
I wonder if Chi can survive alone.

25
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,700
We can't find anyone to take it.

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,710
Dogs and cats are prohibited in these apartments,

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,170
but it's still that kind of baby kitty, right?

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,710
That's true.

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,760
We even gave it a name,

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,100
and abandoning it would be unbearable.

31
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,090
I slept well!

32
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,720
Huh?

33
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,440
Are you worried about something?

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,110
I suppose we'll have to keep it.
