00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,850
Hey!

3
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,390
Ah, Chi.

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,930
Want to play?

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,230
Come here.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,230
Dad will take me to a horrible place, so I hate him!

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,700
Is she still angry about the animal hospital?

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,490
Man, she scratched it this much!

9
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,780
Oh dear.

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,160
Did Chi do this?

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, she did.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
She was scratching away with a grinding sound.

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,290
Oh well, it's all right.

14
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,330
It's not all right!

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,500
Note: Just under $500.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,500
This sofa cost fifty thousand yen!

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm itching to do something.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,430
Scratching this is no good.

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,190
This is no good either.

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,810
It doesn't stand out that much.

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,150
It does!

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,110
Huh?

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,820
Shouldn't I wash those jeans?

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,320
They're all torn!

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,370
The torn look is in!

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,200
Don't you know anything about vintage jeans fashion?

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,500
Ah, Chi!

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,000
These are cool, Dad.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,880
Is Chi the only one that gets it?

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,670
This feels good!

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,260
Please stop!

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,260
Hey!

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,800
Hey, Chi!

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,430
Stop it! Stop it!

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,810
Swing! Swing!

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
No! No!

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,310
These are vintage!

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,520
Chi!

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,110
Chi, are you okay?

40
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,660
Let's tear them one more time!

41
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,120
You shouldn't do that.

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,670
I said you shouldn't do that.

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,080
Dad!

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,170
Chi, no!

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,880
Chi likes Dad's jeans.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,470
Isn't that good, Dad?

47
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,640
You've made up with Chi.

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,100
These are cool, Dad.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,520
Although these are more expensive than the sofa...
