00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,590
We're finally here, the animal hospital.

3
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,050
Let me out!

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,600
It's open!

5
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,590
Huh?

6
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,200
Chi!

7
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,380
What is this place?!

8
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,910
Chi.

9
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,040
Chi, come on out.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,340
It's Dad!

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,630
Dad, I was so scared!

12
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,840
There, there.

13
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,790
As a precaution, please don't let it out of the cage.

14
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,300
S-Sorry.

15
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,760
Yamada-san!

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,460
Yamada Chi-san!

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,270
Ah, yes.

18
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,310
Dad, I don't like it here!

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,530
Let's go home!

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,690
Dad, let's go home!

21
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,760
Huh?

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,320
You took it in, you said?

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,420
Let's see.

24
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,450
Two or three months old I'd say.

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,640
It's a girl.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,300
Oh, a girl?

27
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,840
What on earth is this place?

28
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,050
Her ears are clean.

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,350
There's no sign of conjunctivitis.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,850
Her teeth and gums are both clean too.

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,580
Right, I'll take her temperature.

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,840
Hold her down please.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,360
Okay.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
No! No! No!

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,550
What are you going to do with me?

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,850
I never want to come here again.

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,120
It says "Ms. Yamada Chi"!

38
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,900
Isn't that amazing, Chi has a surname.

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,040
"Ms" as well.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,300
It was really tough.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,260
Right, Chi?

42
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,410
I hate Dad!

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,110
Chi hates me.
