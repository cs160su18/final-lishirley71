00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,200
Chi.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,170
Wanna play?

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,510
I'm busy at the moment!

5
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,050
Huh?

6
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,970
Chi, let's play!

7
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm home.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,620
I'm home.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,520
Welcome home.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,490
A postcard from Grandma has come.

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,900
A postcard?

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,150
Hey, read it!

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,650
It says, "I've gone to Kyoto with Grandpa."

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,150
Kyoto?

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,860
There are lots of old temples and shrines. It's a lovely place.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,580
Look.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,210
Is Youhei-kun well?

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,830
Yeah! I'm well!

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,420
That's nice. Kyoto, huh?

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,360
We went there a long time ago.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,830
Eh? I don't remember this place.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,520
What are those three doing by themselves?

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,030
It was before you were born, Youhei.

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,890
There's a temple called Kiyomizudera and...

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,370
Kiyomizudera?

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,730
It's really high.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,010
It's scary looking down.

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,230
Huh?

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,730
But the scenery is great.

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,030
I'm the only one being left out.

31
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,240
That's it!

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,680
I want to go and see it too!

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,260
Chi is here!

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,790
It's been a while since we went traveling.

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,100
I want to go somewhere!

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,840
That's true.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,100
Once in a while, it's nice to go on holiday together.

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,720
Umm...

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,290
Umm...

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,600
Is there somewhere you want to go, Youhei?

41
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,070
Hmm...

42
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,230
How about that?!

43
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,230
I want to go and check out that place.

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,730
Where is that?

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,120
Is it some place I know?

46
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,210
I suppose Youhei could enjoy that too.

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,090
That's true.

48
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,240
I don't want to be left out!

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,610
Chi!

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,300
We can't see the postcard.

51
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,810
Chi doesn't want too much attention,
but she doesn't want to be neglected.

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,680
After all, she's the type that wants to be right in the middle.
