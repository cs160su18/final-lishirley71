00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,620
I'm going home, Mama.

3
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,610
Huh?

4
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,430
Where is this?

5
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,520
Kitty is moving!

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,030
You're the one that fell at the grassy place!

7
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,820
Why are you here too?

8
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,700
Oh, you've woken up?

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,150
Are you feeling better?

10
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,320
It's a dead end!

11
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,490
Oh dear.

12
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,220
I wonder if we scared it?

13
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,210
What's that?

14
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,260
I thought it might be hungry.

15
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,470
I wonder if it will drink.

16
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,810
I smell something yummy!

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,470
Oh! Milk!

18
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,380
Are we keeping kitty?

19
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,150
Well you see, dogs and cats aren't allowed in our apartment.

20
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,920
It won't work here, so we'll have to find someone to take it.

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,870
I'm full!

22
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,150
I'm going home!

23
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,870
Kitty, do you want to go outside?

24
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,390
Home! Home! Home!

25
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,320
Home! Home! A-Ah...

26
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,720
Youhei!

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,910
It will be caught by the landlord, right?

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,540
What's wrong?

29
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,050
I'll hide here just a little bit longer.
