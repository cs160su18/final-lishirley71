00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,970
Chi?

3
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,280
This is fun!

4
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,040
You just spilled some tea, didn't you?

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,220
Change into this.

6
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,370
Eh, change me!

7
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,620
Goodness me.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,610
There.

9
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,920
It's bright!

10
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,630
But...

11
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,290
the wind is rustling.

12
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,040
Can you keep a kitty?

13
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,950
We've taken one in, but we can't keep it here.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,510
Milk is yummy!

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,040
Mama!

16
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,200
I see.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,210
Bye.

18
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,050
Another no...

19
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,050
I'm going!

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm going home!

21
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,770
Huh?

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,940
Home! Home!

23
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,210
Home! Home! Home!

24
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,880
Home! Home!

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,700
Home!

26
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,790
Oh, Chi!

27
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,010
It's dangerous to be in a spot like this.

28
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,170
It's gonna fall!

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,910
Just as I thought, this fellow couldn't survive outside.
