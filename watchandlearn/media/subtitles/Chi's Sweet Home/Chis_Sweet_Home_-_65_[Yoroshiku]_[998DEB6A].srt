00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm home.

3
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,050
Welcome back.

4
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,710
Chi, here's a present for you.

5
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,280
What's that?

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,060
It's a kanikama, a cat snack.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,640
Snack?

8
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,370
There, Chi.

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,560
It's nice.

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,740
There.

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,980
It tastes good!

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,150
So you think it tastes good.

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,910
I want to give her one too!

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,900
Here.

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,300
Dad, more!

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,420
Okay, okay.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,930
There.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,380
This tastes good!

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,900
If she has too many snacks, she won't eat her dinner.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,950
Youhei and Chi are similar that way.

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,220
Yeah, you're right.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,060
Chi, you can have more tomorrow.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,910
Dad, more!

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,910
This is the last one for today.

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,900
Dad.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,990
Y-Yes, I know.

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,310
Dad, gimme more! Gimme more!

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,250
There, Chi. Here's your dinner.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,840
Huh?

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,090
I don't want this.

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,330
Chi.

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,160
It's because you gave her too many snacks.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,100
Sorry.

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,610
No, no.

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,730
Chi.

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,690
If you're not going to eat your dinner, I'm going to put it away.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,940
Gimme the yummy stuff!

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,880
Have it your own way!

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,690
Good night.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,620
I'm hungry.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,800
Chi.

42
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,900
You're hungry, aren't you?

43
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,880
There.

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,040
Mom.

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,300
Don't eat just snacks.

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,060
If you also eat nutritious food, you'll get big and strong.

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,490
This tastes good,

48
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,900
Mom!
