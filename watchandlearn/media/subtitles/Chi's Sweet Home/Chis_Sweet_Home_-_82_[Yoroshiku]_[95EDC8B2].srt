00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,580
Chi.

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,260
It's time for your meal.

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,390
Chi.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,180
Huh?

6
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,930
The screen door is open.

7
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,940
Walking is fun.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,200
Are you going to follow me?

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,030
I'll follow you.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,640
There are some games.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,620
There are some games!

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,880
Huh?

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,560
You mustn't let them sense you.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,090
Sense?

15
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,950
See?

16
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,300
It's a game!

17
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,250
It ran away.

18
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,640
The game is still here.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,260
This won't even make a souvenir.

20
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,780
Souvenir?

21
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,800
A game you take back home.

22
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,240
That's cool.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,260
I want to take a souvenir to Dad!

24
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,100
It's a game.

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,960
What?

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,030
Wait, wait!

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,790
Wait!

28
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,960
You're my game!

29
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,190
I'm going to get a souvenir!
