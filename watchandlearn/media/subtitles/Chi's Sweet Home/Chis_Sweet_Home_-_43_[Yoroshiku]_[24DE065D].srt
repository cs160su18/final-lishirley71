00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,560
It ate Chi's dinner.

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,690
Chi isn't dinner!

4
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,190
It's no good...

5
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,690
Eh?

6
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,200
It was eaten?

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,160
At once! All in one go!

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,110
It ate my salmon steak in a split second with its big mouth.

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,390
It really is a bother.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,960
Indeed.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,210
Cats really are a nuisance, aren't they?

12
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,710
I-Indeed...

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,560
There you go.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,490
Huh?

15
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,580
What?

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,680
It picked me up.

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,940
That's Chi's chew toy!

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,110
No!

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,370
That's Chi's!

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,080
What are you doing?!

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,620
Huh?

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,100
It's grooming me.

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,990
It's nicer than it appears.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,680
But...

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,320
It ate Chi's dinner!

26
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,830
See you.

27
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,670
Lately, there's a lot of talk at our apartment complex about a black cat.

28
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,090
Oh my.

29
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,180
She ate it all.

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,350
I wonder if she fell asleep on a full stomach.

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,990
I'm exhausted.
