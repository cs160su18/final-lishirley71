00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,330
Here I come,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,110
Gon!

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,360
Bring it!

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,950
Ko!

6
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,760
Gon!

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,870
Are you okay?!

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,610
I'm just fine!

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,770
The hell you are...

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,550
I used Ko to harden my arms and head,

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,020
but my legs couldn't take the impact.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,900
However,

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,690
next time,

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,730
I'll catch it!

15
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,030
Guts x And x Courage

16
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,170
An intense dodgeball match has begun.

17
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,340
Gon was injured by Razor's throw,

18
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,080
but his eyes burn with fire.

19
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,920
Estimating the ball's likely drop point...

20
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,360
Play will resume with Team Gon's
inside players controlling the ball.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,480
But as the ceiling is considered
an extension of the floor,

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Gon is out.

23
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,750
I'm going to use Back.

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,810
But you're...

25
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm doing it!

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,690
He won't listen to us...

27
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,190
Fine... However!

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,830
Don't use Back until we're
down to two inside players!

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,390
Got it?

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Now let's start.

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,330
Gon, get patched up.

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,110
It isn't against the rules to keep
passing the ball like this, is it?

33
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,540
That is okay.

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,240
All right, I'm good now.

35
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,770
Hey!

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,950
I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.

37
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,130
Time for payback, Razor!

38
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,820
Take this...

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,840
Black Goreinu!

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,690
So he can swap the black
one with other people?

41
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,960
You got me good...

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,930
That's what you get.

43
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,580
You're out of there!

44
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,640
He's out, but he's still able to return inside.

45
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,340
At least we can force him to use up his Back.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
And the ball is in our outside territory.

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,850
Huh?

48
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,430
What?

49
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,490
Goreinu!

50
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,450
You have an interesting ability.

51
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,080
You should use it wisely.

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,870
Hold on! What was that?!

53
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,120
There's no rule against passing
the ball to an opponent.

54
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,120
And you're allowed to hit
people in the face here.

55
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,880
So his attack was also legal.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,020
Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out.

57
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,260
Once the user's unconscious,
the Nen beast disappears.

58
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,510
As I suspected, his ability works with
his direct control, not automatically.

59
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,080
If he regains consciousness,

60
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,370
the black ape may begin inside the court.

61
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,660
I don't anticipate that happening, though.

62
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,020
If the interior players are reduced
to zero before Goreinu wakes up,

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,670
the match will be decided.

64
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,300
It's impossible...

65
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,920
Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,180
to remake his Nen beast right away.

67
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,560
Inside the court, it's three versus three.

68
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,060
But we're obviously outmatched.

69
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,820
Half our players are gone,

70
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,490
and we only have one
injured kid on the outside.

71
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,450
Our opponents have a solid outside team,
so they can attack from anywhere.

72
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,420
Razor is still inside,
without needing to use Back.

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,580
And the ball rebounded to our opponents.

74
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,210
We're at a clear disadvantage!

75
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,420
Well, then...

76
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,340
Who is

77
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,800
up next?

78
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,420
Me?

79
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,220
What do I do?

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,040
It's impossible! I can't catch that!

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,110
I have to dodge!

82
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,820
It made a sharp turn?

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,780
Hisoka!

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,790
Bungee Gum!

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,640
That bastard...

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,570
He got us good.

87
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,560
He faked going for me,

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,570
when his real goal was taking out
Bisky and Hisoka in a straight line.

89
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,180
Actually, he could have

90
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,710
gambled that I'd dodge left.

91
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,100
Had I done that...

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,860
Bisky is out!

93
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,610
Move to the outside court.

94
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,030
What?

95
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,110
Didn't she dodge?

96
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,360
My own fault.

97
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,370
Huh?

98
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,620
This means your clothes count
as part of your body, right?

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes.

100
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,250
I was certain she'd dodged it...

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,420
We're down to two!

102
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,010
You can't let them get the ball!

103
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,260
Back!

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,760
Gon has used Back.

105
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,510
He may move back inside.

106
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,020
Can we really trust a kid with this?

107
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,650
He's no ordinary kid...

108
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,150
He's the only one who's even
tried to catch Razor's throw.

109
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,760
Are you all right?

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah.

111
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,590
Listen to me.

112
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,450
Do not overdo it!

113
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,160
Yeah.

114
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,880
What's one plus one?

115
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,790
Yeah.

116
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,290
This is hopeless.

117
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,190
Okay!

118
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,150
Beat him, even if it kills you!

119
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,040
Osu.

120
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,510
You okay?

121
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,300
Yep.

122
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,840
I've discovered something.

123
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,930
If the ball travels outside the court,
it becomes much less powerful.

124
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,430
Without using Ko, I only injured a couple fingers.

125
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,760
Then if we avoid Razor's throws,

126
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,590
we will avoid any significant damage.

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
Exactly so.

128
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,690
That won't be a victory.

129
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,320
Huh?

130
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,230
Don't be stupid...

131
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,460
If we can't win no matter what
we do, all this is pointless!

132
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,250
You'd better cool down, stupid.

133
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,930
Aren't you mad?

134
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,710
Huh?!

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,710
If you'd dodged left, you could've died.

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,660
Right?

137
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,100
I'm really pissed off...

138
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,220
I won't settle for some cheap win.

139
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,980
We have to utterly destroy him!

140
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,910
You must have a plan in mind...

141
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,740
Yeah.

142
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,050
I've got this.

143
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,630
Killua, stand over there.

144
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,120
Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball.

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,130
Okay.

146
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,750
I get it!

147
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,650
First comes rock!

148
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,770
His aura just spiked!

149
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,690
Rock, paper...

150
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,420
Rock!

151
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,360
First comes rock!

152
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,800
His aura just spiked!

153
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,890
Rock, paper...

154
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,190
Rock!

155
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,310
Number 13 is out.

156
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,480
Catching the ball while touching the area
outside is illegal and does not count.

157
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,730
Play will resume with Team Gon's
outside players controlling the ball.

158
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,500
Wow!

159
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,900
He sent the biggest one flying.

160
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,860
Damn it...

161
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,360
That wasn't good enough!

162
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,920
He looks unhappy...

163
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,470
He's actually upset.

164
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,120
That kid's really got guts.

165
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,710
Not enough yet...

166
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,370
Not enough to defeat the real Razor!

167
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,990
I need more power!

168
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,180
Okay, let's do it again.

169
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,590
Give it to Razor good!

170
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah.

171
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,080
To beat Razor,

172
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll need a lot more power.

173
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,370
Ren.

174
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,720
What?

175
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,300
His aura is immense.

176
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,120
You may have chosen the wrong sport.

177
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,620
He has all the time in the
world to build up his power.

178
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,980
You might want to dodge this one.

179
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,630
You must be joking.

180
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,880
Focus all the refined aura

181
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,130
into my fist.

182
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,280
First comes rock!

183
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,580
Take this, Razor!

184
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,540
Rock!

185
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Paper...

186
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,080
Rock!

187
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,900
Perfect!

188
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,050
No way he'll catch that!

189
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,770
He's receiving it?

190
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,660
He used his own body to reduce its power.

191
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,450
Nice move.

192
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,170
That required perfect timing.

193
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,330
But he was able to pull it off.

194
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,420
This man truly is strong.

195
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,430
Amazing...

196
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,610
You can do more than just
dodge or catch the ball.

197
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,940
But I doubt that tip will help you.

198
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,630
That ball was as strong as Razor's,

199
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,200
but it didn't even reach the ceiling.

200
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,450
He managed to burn off enough
momentum with that receive.

201
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,660
Now the ball's directly over him!

202
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,580
Bungee gum.

203
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,710
Too bad for you.

204
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,010
You have to catch the ball, after all.

205
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,950
As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out.

206
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,970
Step to the outside.

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Back.

208
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,530
Razor has used Back!

209
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,850
He remains inside.

210
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,940
Both teams have used Back,
and it's three-on-two!

211
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,280
The tables have turned!

212
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,810
Really?

213
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,490
Our team is the one on the ropes.

214
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,400
Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.

215
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,140
No, he probably can't even hold
the ball with his right hand.

216
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,200
Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.

217
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,370
He should be starting to feel tired about now.

218
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,340
For him to be able to make another,
equally strong throw is unlikely.

219
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,810
So Killua is the only uninjured
player left on the inside?

220
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,580
No, you have it backwards.

221
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,290
He's probably sustained the most damage of all.

222
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,880
What do you mean?

223
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,930
You okay, Gon?

224
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,230
Yeah, but we need one more... I think.

225
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,790
I'll put everything into this one.

226
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,910
All right!

227
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,780
This time, end it.

228
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,490
One more throw...

229
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,040
I can take it.

230
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,350
Just hold out!

231
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,420
When Gon launched his ball,

232
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,790
Killua barely used any
protective Nen on his hands.

233
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,800
That's insane.

234
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,490
You saw the power of that launch...

235
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,760
Like a cannon opening fire!

236
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,270
Correct.

237
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,540
Essentially, he used his bare hands
to form the cannon's barrel.

238
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,640
Had Killua used a significant amount
of Nen to protect his hands,

239
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,290
his aura would have become a
barrier against Gon's punch,

240
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,310
reducing the power to the ball.

241
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,090
In order to avoid weakening the ball,

242
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,550
Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.

243
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,970
Killua's hands must be in far worse shape

244
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,290
than Hisoka's right hand.

245
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,120
Damn... I'm a fool!

246
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,560
How could I not be over there?

247
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,760
I know the technique.

248
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,130
And I can do it faster than Killua.

249
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,310
In the instant before Gon touches the ball,

250
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,460
you can apply a lightning-fast coat of
aura to your hands for protection!

251
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,570
Wait!

252
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,070
Time out!

253
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,820
Ref, I have a question.

254
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,040
What is it?

255
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,250
Can inside players choose
to move to the outside?

256
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,120
That doesn't violate any rules,

257
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,830
but you can't return inside.

258
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,850
Right... Come here!

259
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,720
Gon, if you come outside,
I can hold the ball for you.

260
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,290
Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.

261
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,480
I doubt he's in any condition
to hold the ball for you.

262
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,530
I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura

263
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,110
in order to protect my hands.

264
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,490
I'll hold the ball, and you can
take Razor out from here.

265
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,870
It's our only way to win.

266
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,340
We can't do that.

267
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,120
Yeah.

268
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,930
Wh-Why not?

269
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,420
Where's the problem?

270
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,330
It would be a cop-out.

271
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,280
Huh?

272
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,880
This isn't the time to worry about that!

273
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,380
Don't overdo it, pops.

274
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,350
You took a pretty big hit.

275
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm doing fine.

276
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,290
I'm not hurting as much as you think.

277
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,260
Then show me your hands.

278
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,610
I'm all right.

279
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,630
Look!

280
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,300
He can't feel anything but pain.

281
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,040
I can do this!

282
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,410
I can take one more ball.

283
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,670
Gon, I can do this!

284
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,040
It's impossible!

285
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,660
Gon, help me convince him.

286
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,520
I already knew...

287
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,320
I knew Killua's hands were messed up.

288
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,940
Tsezgerra-san,

289
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm sorry, but I won't move outside.

290
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,000
I need Killua to hold the ball.

291
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,120
He's the only one who can do it!

292
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,260
If Bisky or Hisoka held it,
I probably couldn't use my full strength.

293
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,080
The only reason I can focus
wholly on hitting the ball

294
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,710
is because Killua's holding it for me.

295
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,830
So, got it now, pops?

296
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,690
Go get some rest.

297
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,370
I understand.

298
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,850
I'm counting on you!

299
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,300
Hisoka, give me the ball.

300
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,170
We will now resume the match.

301
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,200
Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,870
Now we're even.

303
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,750
Brilliant!

304
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,990
She hit him at just the right angle
so the ball would rebound to us.

305
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,380
Number 2 is out!

306
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,510
That leaves only...

307
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,980
Razor alone!

308
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,020
Gon, we need to regain
the ball from Razor first.

309
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,350
Of course.

310
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,270
One sec.

311
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,540
I understand. That sounds interesting.

312
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,470
I'm not sure it'll work, though...

313
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,790
Oh, but I would so love to try it.

314
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,070
Let's give it a shot, Killua.

315
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,400
Okay.

316
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,270
Then it's settled.

317
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,700
Man, you always come up
with the craziest ideas.

318
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,080
Counting on you, Killua.

319
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,650
We will resume the match now.

320
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,780
Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.

321
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,150
What sort of team play will emerge

322
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,120
when their friendship is backed
by the addition of Hisoka?

323
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:08,150
G.I. Tutorial

324
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

325
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,130
Today, we introduce the card Contact.

326
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:18,750
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]

327
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,100
It uses your Binder to let you
contact any player you've met.

328
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,180
What are you doing?

329
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,530
Contacting aliens.

330
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,980
Wow, it worked!

331
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,870
Continue!

332
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,580
Next time: Bargain x And x Deal.

333
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,010
Let's do this, Killua!

334
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,560
Are you ready, Hisoka?

335
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,260
Yes.

336
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,760
Unite!
