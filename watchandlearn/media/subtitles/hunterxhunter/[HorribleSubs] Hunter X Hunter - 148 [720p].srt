2
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,710
He abandoned you when you were still just a baby.

3
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,960
But you still want to...

4
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,900
He was willing to abandon his own kid for it.

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,660
That's how amazing it is to be a Hunter!

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,560
You really are his son...

7
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,540
The last test to be accepted
by Ging-san is to find him.

8
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,940
It's a task more difficult than any Hunt.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,010
As far as I know, he's the greatest Hunter there is.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,170
There's something that I want.

11
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,790
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.

12
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,550
Catch me if you can.

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,970
You are a Hunter, aren't you?

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,270
Ging...

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Past x And x Future

16
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
You want to climb the tree?

17
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,980
No one under the age of eighteen
can go beyond this point.

18
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,030
Unless you have some special
license or certification...

19
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,220
A pro Hunter?

20
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,470
At your age?

21
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,140
Excuse me, then.

22
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,260
Go right ahead.

23
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,980
But I'll need you to sign this first.

24
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,250
Even a president would have to sign it.

25
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,990
It's just the usual thing that says you
don't care if you die during the climb.

26
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,750
Here's some advice!

27
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,260
Don't trust any of the grips or footholds
left behind by previous climbers.

28
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,990
Those who make it to the top
usually do it bare-handed.

29
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,050
That's how the guy who's at
the top right now did it.

30
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,520
Got it! Thanks!

31
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,320
Well, if you feel you're in trouble,
just press that button.

32
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,870
Our rescue team is skilled.

33
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,670
If you can hold on to the tree for ten minutes—

34
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,910
He fell?!

35
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,790
Hey!

36
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,270
Hey!

37
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,570
He's already up there?

38
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,630
I still have a long way to go...

39
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,330
This tree is incredible.

40
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,080
I can entrust myself to it.

41
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,380
The moment my fingers touch it,

42
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,390
I can feel that there's life there,

43
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,070
and that it flows throughout the entire tree.

44
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,720
I can do this!

45
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,450
So long as I heed the tree's whispering as I climb...

46
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,310
Help...

47
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,360
Help me...

48
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,760
Almost there.

49
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,060
The top looks funny.

50
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,100
They're huge!

51
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,980
That scared me...

52
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,740
Hi!

53
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,930
Yo.

54
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,940
I was tired of waiting.

55
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,890
Ging...

56
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,260
How long did it take you to get
here from the 500-meter point?

57
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,220
Uh...

58
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Around twenty minutes?

59
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,710
Well, I guess that's acceptable for your first time...

60
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,980
Eat up.

61
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,270
Yep!

62
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,980
Beautiful view, right?

63
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,750
On overcast days, it's like a sea of clouds.

64
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,650
Yeah!

65
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,290
Hey, Ging...

66
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Hmm?

67
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,190
Can I ask you something?

68
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,990
Sure. I might not give you an answer, though.

69
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,530
What is it that you want?

70
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,000
That which I can't see in front of me right now.

71
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,500
That which you can't see in front of you?

72
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,560
I wanted to become a Hunter because...

73
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,300
Shut up!

74
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,570
I wanted to become a Hunter because,

75
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,490
at the time, it was the most practical way

76
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,580
to get into the place I wanted to go.

77
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,760
That place was used as a certain
royal family's burial ground.

78
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,590
To enter, you had to belong to
a trustworthy organization,

79
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,600
and to agree never to speak of it.

80
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,290
And you had to pay all expenses out of pocket.

81
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,850
In other words, you couldn't really explore it at all.

82
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,320
You won't find anyone willing to spend

83
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,670
the resources and receive nothing in return.

84
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,290
But I saw it as my chance.

85
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,640
If I became a trusted pro Hunter,

86
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,820
getting the money wouldn't be a problem.

87
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
When I turned fifteen,

88
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,040
I set up a special nonprofit organization

89
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,090
to explore and repair the tomb.

90
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,040
Before that, I'd spent the two
years after getting my license

91
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,450
surfing archaeology buffs' websites and blogs online.

92
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,020
To create the nonprofit, I needed about ten oddballs

93
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,770
who didn't need money or fame,
but only wanted to know the truth,

94
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,690
and who could be trusted to keep secrets.

95
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,760
I'm always going after what I need.

96
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:33,510
I'm so focused, I stop caring about
the ultimate goal that lies beyond.

97
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
Too hard to understand?

98
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,050
Then I guess I'll keep going.

99
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,230
The people I recruited online and
befriended in offline meetings

100
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,810
were all older than me.

101
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,260
They were regular office workers,
graduate students, and job-hoppers.

102
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,100
After I told them my background and plan,

103
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,120
they helped with the various tasks
to create the nonprofit,

104
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,940
and they even gave donations
from what little money they had.

105
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,270
When our dream was realized and
we stepped inside for the first time,

106
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,300
the best part for me

107
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,000
wasn't when I finally witnessed the truth of the tomb.

108
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,230
It was when I looked

109
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,850
at my colleagues' faces and shook their hands.

110
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,230
To this day, they still work for the
nonprofit with zero compensation,

111
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,620
providing me with viable information.

112
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,000
The secret of the tomb

113
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,610
was nothing compared to the relationships I built.

114
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,560
What was truly important came
to me before what I wanted.

115
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,450
And now?

116
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,900
Huh?

117
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,650
What are you after now?

118
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,490
Right now?

119
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,720
It'll take some time to explain...

120
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
Gon,

121
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,090
what is this tree we just climbed?

122
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,770
Huh? It's the World Tree.

123
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,860
That's right.

124
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,430
Down below, how did they describe the tree?

125
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,930
At 1,784 meters, it's the world's tallest tree.

126
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,180
Technically, that's right.

127
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,630
But the truth is that this tree

128
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,690
is a young sapling that's stopped growing.

129
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,890
A World Tree that

130
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,450
didn't receive enough nutrition,
and could only grow this tall.

131
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,210
A real World Tree

132
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,270
would take in magma,

133
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,530
embed its roots in the mountains,

134
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,270
and continue to grow after leaving the atmosphere.

135
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,220
Outside this world.

136
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,610
This world?

137
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,110
The world map that you're familiar with.

138
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,540
The Ants that you and the chairman fought

139
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,300
were a non-native species from outside this world.

140
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,800
That's the truth they don't teach you in school.

141
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,440
Adults with common sense

142
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,790
choose not to go near Pandora's Box.

143
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,280
In other words, the world that we know

144
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,600
is nothing but a small part of a much bigger world.

145
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,120
There are records showing that a chosen few,

146
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,640
from a select time and place,
were able to make it outside.

147
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,210
Understand now?

148
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,100
I still want the same thing I always have.

149
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,440
Something that I can't see in front of me.

150
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,530
There are many requirements to go outside.

151
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,710
At least four are required before
you can even start the journey.

152
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,780
Authorization,

153
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,220
the means,

154
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,210
qualification,

155
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,220
a contract.

156
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,450
I still haven't obtained a single one.

157
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,870
But I'm in no rush.

158
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm enjoying the journey.

159
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,560
So if our paths happen to cross in the future...

160
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,740
You should enjoy the little detours.

161
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,360
To the fullest.

162
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,790
Because that's where you'll find the things

163
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,730
more important than what you want.

164
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,230
Oh!

165
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,720
Ging...

166
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,590
Here.

167
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,580
Kite asked me to return this to you.

168
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,640
Oh, okay.

169
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,310
The scar's still on my shoulder.

170
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,410
See? Right here.

171
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,560
And then, there was a huge boom!

172
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,530
And what popped out was
another coffin, just this big.

173
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,350
They're called the Testing Gates,
and you have to open them to go inside.

174
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,550
Marshal

175
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,550
Spy

176
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,420
You should enjoy the little detours.

177
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,340
To the fullest.

178
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,650
Because that's where you'll find the things

179
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,540
more important than what you want.
