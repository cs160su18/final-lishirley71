2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:11,490
Shroud

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,200
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,270
Oh...

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,520
Don't look at me like that.

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,030
Schwing

25
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,030
I'm getting turned on.

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,030
A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick

27
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,170
Gon was able to land a solid
punch to Hisoka's face.

28
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,440
Will he be able to win the match?

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,300
Critical!

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,670
Two points for Gon!

31
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,180
Amazing! Gon managed
to land a critical hit!

32
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,590
He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,310
Gon is on top!

34
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,450
However,

35
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,320
it appears that his punch hasn't
dealt much damage to Hisoka.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,570
I have to question the referee's decision...

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,580
The referee is entitled to award
points as he pleases.

38
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,660
Huh?

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,440
Some referees award points based
on the amount of damage done,

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,380
while some base scores on
strategy and technique.

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,250
I believe the referee in this case
was rewarding the fighter for

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,340
using the stone block in his attack.

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,190
I see...

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,420
So, who are you?

45
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,600
Okay!

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,490
O-Oh...

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,060
For the first time in this fight,
Hisoka has moved!

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,760
And he's smiling ever so slightly.

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,250
Is he finally getting serious?

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,260
What was that about?!

51
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,530
I have no idea!

52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,170
How much have you learned

53
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,050
about Nen?

54
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,050
All of the basics.

55
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,540
I see.

56
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,520
You must be an Enhancer.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,210
H-How did you know?

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,220
You're so adorable...

59
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,070
You should do a better job
of keeping a secret.

60
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,390
Shut up!

61
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,070
How did you know?

62
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,290
I used a method similar to the
blood type personality test.

63
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,240
And it's just as unreliable.

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,580
I devised my own way of using
personality to classify aura.

65
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,030
Enhancers are simple and earnest.

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,710
He nailed it.

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,460
He's right.

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,520
By the way, I'm a Transmuter,

69
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,210
fickle and dishonest.

70
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,470
It fits.

71
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,590
He nailed it.

72
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,970
Emitters have short tempers.

73
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,650
Specialists are independent.

74
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,940
Conjurers are high-strung.

75
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,860
Manipulators are argumentative.

76
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,300
The two of us are quite compatible.

77
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,040
Our opposing personalities attract.

78
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,860
We could become very intimate.

79
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,240
But you should take care,
because Transmuters are fickle.

80
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,750
It takes a mere second for
treasure to turn to trash.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,510
So...

82
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,010
Do not disappoint me, Gon.

83
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,440
He's fast!

84
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,180
Wh-What a strong kick.

85
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,590
He sent that stone block flying
all the way to the entrance!

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,180
Fast, fast, fast!

87
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,810
Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.

88
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,960
Critical for Hisoka!

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,130
Add points.

90
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,260
3-2!

91
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,840
His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,460
as a critical strike.

93
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,770
He's regained the lead.

94
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,820
Gon appears to be confused...

95
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,360
Does he have no way to fight back?

96
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,270
He's backing off.

97
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,870
Amazing...

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,280
Too amazing.

99
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,580
What's wrong?

100
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,230
Attack me.

101
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,540
Forget it.
I'm brainstorming!

102
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,300
I can just barely follow him by eye,

103
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,320
but the rest of my body can't keep up.

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,050
At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!

105
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,970
Very well.

106
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,310
Then I'll have to force you
to come over here...

107
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,560
Gon, use Gyo !

108
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,070
Crap!

109
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,700
Do you understand

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,080
what is happening?

111
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,180
Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!

112
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,120
This is my Elastic Love...

113
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,250
Also known as Bungee Gum.

114
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,260
It can expand and contract.

115
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,010
And attach and detach as I desire...

116
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,980
You won't be able to escape.

117
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,980
Critical and down.

118
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,860
Plus three points to Hisoka.

119
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,080
6-2!

120
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,910
Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!

121
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,330
Gon is down!

122
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,110
He turns his aura into a rubbery substance

123
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,090
capable of attaching to other objects.

124
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,590
Bungee Gum.

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,850
Tsk.

126
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,340
Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.

127
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,350
Stand up, Gon...

128
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,600
Damn.

129
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,330
The score is 6-2.

130
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,580
Hisoka increases his lead.

131
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,360
Will his undefeated record continue?

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,780
Stand up, kid!

133
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,240
Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!

134
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,270
You can do it!

135
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,400
Can you fight?

136
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,640
Of course.

137
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,310
Oh, Gon is standing...

138
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,270
But he's sustained significant damage!

139
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,580
Okay, I have a question for you.

140
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,090
Huh?

141
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,090
If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit.

142
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,340
What?

143
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,850
When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?

144
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,190
When did he attach his Gum?

145
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
One...

146
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,600
When I elbowed you.

147
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,830
Two...

148
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,710
When I landed a clean hit.

149
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,330
Three...

150
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,110
When I landed a critical strike?

151
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,610
When was it?

152
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,370
Three! When you hit me with both hands!

153
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,490
Wrong!

154
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,870
The answer is four.

155
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,210
When I was giving you my
aura personality analysis.

156
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,380
That's dirty!

157
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,890
Damn.

158
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,140
If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...

159
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,510
Now, I have a warning for you.

160
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,900
Had you been using Gyo,

161
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,010
you would have been able to notice my aura,

162
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,020
and you could have avoided it

163
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,410
during my aura personality analysis.

164
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,160
However, what about situations
one, two, and three?

165
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,100
Have you figured it out?

166
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,650
I could have also attached my Bungee Gum

167
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,170
while directly attacking you.

168
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,540
You only need to conceal your aura when you
wish to catch your opponent off guard.

169
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,810
Normally, you use your aura while attacking.

170
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,240
It doesn't matter if your
opponent sees your aura

171
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,940
when you're landing attacks.

172
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,950
He's right.

173
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,350
If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks,

174
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,630
using Gyo to see his aura won't help!

175
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,290
This is bad.

176
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,450
His power's far more difficult to
handle than I expected!

177
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,260
So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks

178
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,170
if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.

179
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,710
But if you're able to defend...

180
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,310
No, defending won't work.

181
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,470
Even if you block, he can still attach
his aura to the part you block with.

182
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,240
I can't escape.

183
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,810
What should I do?

184
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,050
Okay, that's enough talk.

185
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,980
Let us prepare for battle.

186
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,990
Resume.

187
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,990
If I can't escape,

188
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,750
I'll go to him!

189
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,250
Gon...

190
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,880
Gon!

191
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,190
Good...

192
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,510
You're so good.

193
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,010
Those eyes.

194
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,770
That look.

195
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,020
That spirit...

196
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,280
I can't wait

197
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,030
to break you.

198
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,540
But not yet...

199
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,490
More...

200
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,800
More!

201
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,930
Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.

202
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,050
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!

203
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,810
Once you've matured...

204
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,520
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!

205
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,520
Until you've reached soaring new heights...

206
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,730
I must wait.

207
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,010
A vicious rush!

208
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,900
Oh, not again!

209
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,250
Hisoka draws Gon into another
punch from his left fist!

210
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,510
Good.

211
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,280
I managed to block that!

212
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,690
I'm getting used to being dragged
around by his Bungee Gum.

213
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
This isn't over.

214
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,560
It's not over yet!

215
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,130
I'm scared...

216
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,770
But if I let my fear overcome me,

217
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,740
I'll never be able to beat anyone else!

218
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,710
Critical for both sides!

219
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,990
Plus two points!

220
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,980
Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!

221
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,740
What?

222
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,750
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!

223
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,200
I was never knocked down!

224
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,170
I got right back up!

225
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,250
I even blocked his attack!

226
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,240
What?

227
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,810
Something's wrong with this ref!

228
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,000
Are you blind?

229
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,900
Oh, we have another strange call.

230
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,340
In response to the ref's decision,

231
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,620
the crowd has filled the arena with boos.

232
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,210
Fight!

233
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,340
If he gets ten points, I lose.

234
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,770
I only have one point left.

235
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,280
He doesn't need to knock me down.

236
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,530
If I get hit by any attack, it's over!

237
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,280
You must be more vigilant, Gon.

238
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,160
Look to the right.

239
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh, sorry.

240
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,080
I meant my right.

241
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,390
Down, and clean hit!

242
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,220
Plus two points.

243
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,390
11-4.

244
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,400
The winner, by, TKO, is...

245
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,200
Hisoka!

246
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,130
Huh?

247
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,290
While you were complaining to the referee,

248
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,130
I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.

249
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,130
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!

250
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,930
Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.

251
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,810
So...

252
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,890
It's really over?

253
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,240
You've made incredible progress.

254
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,180
But you lack experience.

255
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,250
About ten more fights, and you
should stand a better chance.

256
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,750
If we're in Heavens Arena, at least.

257
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,510
Therefore,

258
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,570
I will not fight you here again.

259
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,510
Next time,

260
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,510
we'll fight in the real world,
without any rules to restrain us.

261
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,520
With our lives on the line.

262
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,030
He's so far away...

263
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,950
But he's not out of reach.

264
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,820
I need more training in Nen...

265
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,040
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!

266
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,070
With this victory, Hisoka has
earned his tenth win

267
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,330
and the right to challenge a Floor Master!

268
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,310
Gon has fought bravely, and we wish
him the best in his next match.

269
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,420
So that's all for now.

270
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,320
This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!

271
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,720
A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.

272
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,450
But given today's matchup,

273
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,060
I thought it prudent

274
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,040
to end the fight as quickly as possible,

275
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,200
even if it meant lowering my standards.

276
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,260
So he's a technical ref.

277
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,570
What does that mean?

278
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,370
If a ref believes that a
fight may get dangerous,

279
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,220
he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly.

280
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,690
You have to take that into
consideration when placing a bet.

281
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,230
Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0...

282
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,500
I have nothing to say to you
about the fight with Hisoka.

283
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,990
You were the one fighting him,
so I'm sure you understand best of all.

284
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,990
Understand what?

285
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,000
What he learned from that fight.

286
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,390
Yes!

287
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,610
Gon, what did you learn?

288
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,540
A secret.

289
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,500
Gon-kun, Killua-kun...

290
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,290
You will need to master
your own styles of Nen,

291
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,260
as you continue down your chosen paths.

292
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,580
Yes!

293
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,660
Yeah.

294
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm glad I was able to meet you.

295
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,650
You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!

296
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,160
You think you can pass us?

297
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,610
One day, for sure!

298
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,720
Won't happen.

299
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,680
I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi.

300
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,850
Osu!

301
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,590
Well, let's go.

302
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,440
Yeah.

303
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,160
Thank you for everything, Wing-san!

304
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,810
Yeah, same here.

305
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,910
Thank you.

306
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,570
Take care, you two.

307
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,990
Zushi, until we meet again!

308
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,140
Osu!

309
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,900
Well, you finally accomplished
your objective, right?

310
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,430
Uh-huh.

311
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,270
Then we don't have any more business here.

312
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,460
Gon, what are you going to do?

313
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,100
Go back to Whale Island.

314
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,690
Whale Island?

315
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Uh-huh.

316
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,970
I was able to return the favor to Hisoka,

317
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,450
so I want to go back to the island,
and show Mito-san my license.

318
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,200
It's been over half a year since I left...

319
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,050
I guess I'll come with you.

320
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,710
Huh?

321
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,360
I'd like to meet Mito-san.

322
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,340
Really?

323
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,000
Then let's go together.

324
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,340
Yeah, I'll just tag along.

325
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,890
Bye-bye, Heavens Arena.

326
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,730
Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka

327
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,680
and return the tag, as he'd promised.

328
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,850
Despite losing the fight,

329
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,780
Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.

330
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

331
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

332
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

333
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

334
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

335
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

336
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

337
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

338
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:19,960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

339
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,780
Today, we introduce...

340
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,380
Gon!

341
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,790
Gon learned that he still
has a ways to go,

342
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,910
Me?

343
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,620
Gon became my first friend,

344
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,240
after we met during the Hunter Exam.

345
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,020
but he also met his goal of
repaying an old debt.

346
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,570
He's fun to be around because

347
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,250
his expressions are always changing,

348
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,960
He's intent on getting stronger.

349
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,960
and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.

350
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,170
Next time: Ging x And x Gon!

351
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,310
Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?

352
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,050
I-I-I can't do much,
but thank you for letting me stay!

353
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,300
You're stuttering.
