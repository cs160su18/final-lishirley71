2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,410
He's so far away...

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,780
But he's not out of reach.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,970
I need more training in Nen...

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,240
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!

6
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,090
Mito-san!

7
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,090
Mito-san!

8
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,160
Mito-san!

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,180
Gon...

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,780
Gon!

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,330
Mito-san!

12
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm home, Mito-san.

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,130
Welcome home, Gon.

14
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,370
You must be Killua, right?

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,130
Ging x And x Gon

16
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,630
Sheesh,

17
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,630
you should have let me know
you were coming home.

18
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,140
I didn't have time to prepare anything.

19
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,640
It's not a big deal, whatever is fine.

20
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,400
What are you saying?

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,030
Your friend came all the
way out here to visit.

22
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,140
No, it's okay.

23
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,040
Honestly, you should have
said something first...

24
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,200
Are you listening to me?

25
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,910
Oh, that's right...

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,050
Take a bath while I make
something to eat.

27
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,140
And put out your dirty clothes.

28
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,260
I'll be doing laundry.

29
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,440
Okay, later.

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,160
Now!

31
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,670
You have ten seconds!

32
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,760
One.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,830
Two.

34
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,880
Three.

35
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,870
Is she always like this?

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,080
Four.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,060
Five.

38
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,430
Pretty much.

39
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,160
Six.

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,150
Let's move fast!

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
Seven.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,920
Eight.

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Nine.

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,970
Yeah, this is the life...

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,680
Okay, let's eat.

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,100
Wow!

47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,690
This looks delicious.

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,370
What are you doing?

49
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,370
Offering our thanks.

50
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,830
What does that mean?

51
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,370
All right...

52
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's dig in.

53
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,400
Please help yourself, Killua.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,250
Right.

55
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,050
Oh, right, Mito-san.

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,020
Look!

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,300
This is a Hunter License.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,900
Hmm...

59
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,750
It looks pretty normal.

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,070
There.

61
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,620
Hey, what are you doing?

62
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,260
Just kidding...

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,040
I would never do anything like that.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
Man, what if it doesn't work anymore?

65
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,310
Mito-san, I'm going to show
Killua around the island.

66
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,390
Won't that take a while?

67
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,180
Want me to pack some food for you?

68
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
That's okay!

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,430
We'll find something to eat in the forest.

70
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,150
Gon and his friend are rather late.

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,990
It's been a while since he
was last on this island.

72
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,530
And he's brought his first friend along.

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm sure they won't be back until it's late.

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,860
You're right...

75
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,680
Maybe I should take some
food out to them.

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,310
Hey, Gon.

77
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,310
What are you going to do now?

78
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,710
For now, I'll rest up here

79
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,100
while I gather information...

80
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,410
The information I'll need before I go
to Yorknew to look for my dad.

81
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,380
Oh...

82
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,930
What should I do?

83
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,660
Huh?

84
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,770
You should stay here and then
go to Yorknew with me!

85
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,530
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

86
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,510
That wasn't what I meant.

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,860
I was thinking you're sort of admirable.

88
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,970
There's nothing I really want to do...

89
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,900
I don't really have anything
I want to do like you do.

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Though there are plenty of
things I don't want to do.

91
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,410
I don't want to stay in that house...

92
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,780
Or inherit the family business.

93
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,540
I guess I'm a little jealous.

94
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,800
Killua...

95
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,430
I think it's fun to be with you.

96
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,060
Wh-What's that about?

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,430
Whale Island

98
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,450
is a place for fishermen to stay
during extended outings.

99
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,640
There aren't too many native residents.

100
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,710
There's one other kid here that's
around my age, and she's a girl.

101
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,820
So you're my first friend who's the same age.

102
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,200
My situation was similar...

103
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,370
Stuck in that house all day.

104
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,830
I spent all my time learning how to kill.

105
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,470
You were my first friend.

106
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,150
Do you have fun when we're together?

107
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,340
I guess, yeah.

108
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,140
Then let's stick together!

109
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,410
We can travel around and
see the world together!

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,300
Don't you ever feel embarrassed
saying that stuff?

111
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,480
I'll be looking for my dad.

112
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,140
You'll be looking for what you want to do.

113
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,110
It'll be a blast!

114
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,840
Yeah.

115
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,690
Doesn't sound too bad.

116
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,500
Okay!

117
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll help you look for your dad until
I discover what I want to do!

118
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,830
Okay!

119
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,900
Oh, what's your mom doing?

120
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,790
It's hard asking about my dad,
but asking about my mom is even harder.

121
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,300
Since Mito-san raised me by herself,

122
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,780
it would feel wrong to ask her that...

123
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,920
Is that how it works?

124
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,650
At first, Mito-san told me

125
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,430
my parents died in a traffic accident.

126
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,870
She was worried that I
might end up like my dad

127
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,020
if I learned he was alive and a Hunter...

128
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,940
And she was right.

129
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
When I found out about my dad,

130
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,490
I kind of figured that my
mom was probably dead.

131
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,620
That's pretty harsh!

132
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,310
So I've always thought of Mito-san as my mom.

133
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,520
She's the only mom I have.

134
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,950
So there's nothing for me to ask.

135
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,510
I don't need to.

136
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,730
I see.

137
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,590
Man,

138
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,780
I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...

139
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,140
She's the best!

140
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,980
Though she does nag a lot.

141
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,080
That's nothing...

142
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,720
My mom starts crying the second
I say I want to go outside!

143
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,610
She actually goes into hysterics!

144
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,730
Say...

145
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,760
What?

146
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,060
How long will you be staying?

147
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,440
Maybe a month?

148
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,450
After that...

149
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm going to look for my dad.

150
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,700
What's this?

151
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Something Ging left with me.

152
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,410
Huh?

153
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,100
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.

154
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,070
My dad left this for me...

155
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,220
I'll tell you

156
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,230
everything I know about Ging.

157
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,580
Ging is my cousin.

158
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,960
My oldest memory of him is of his back.

159
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,670
I was always running after him.

160
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,170
I think back then, I was three...

161
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,470
I have the feeling that I was
always looking at his back.

162
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,400
At age twelve, Ging left the
island to take the Hunter Exam,

163
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,230
just like you did.

164
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,770
He suddenly said that
he was leaving the island.

165
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,270
When I asked him why, he told me this...

166
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,400
"There's something that I want."

167
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,950
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.

168
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,590
We argued...

169
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,160
Actually, it was just me making a fuss.

170
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,550
But I never got to see Ging again
before he left the island.

171
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,170
You were originally told

172
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,670
that your parents died in a
traffic accident, right?

173
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,180
That was what happened to Mito's parents.

174
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,420
It happened right after Ging left the island.

175
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,620
After that,

176
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,310
Ging's father went missing on a fishing trip.

177
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,570
Both of my sons ended up passing away.

178
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,320
Yes...

179
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,690
All that happened after he left.

180
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,080
Ten years later, Ging returned to the island.

181
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,220
When he returned, he came carrying you,

182
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,090
and you were still a baby.

183
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,670
He just popped up, out of nowhere.

184
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,260
And he asked us to take care of you.

185
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,630
When I asked about your mother,
he'd only say that they were separated.

186
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,060
I was about to agree to look after you,
when I heard a loud,

187
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,650
"Don't be silly!"

188
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,200
I imagine everyone on the island heard it.

189
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,280
Grandma, you don't need to mention that!

190
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,700
Anyhow, I knew we couldn't
count on him to raise you.

191
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,850
So we don't know anything
about your mother.

192
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,790
Mito even yelled,

193
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,070
"Don't you ever come back!"
while she cried...

194
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,170
Grandma!

195
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,100
Anyway, Ging left this with us then.

196
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,970
This girl's tried to throw it away
so many times...

197
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,110
That's because you always
put it back where it was!

198
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,040
If you wanted to get rid of it,

199
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,300
you should have buried or burned it,
rather than tossing it in the trash can.

200
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,120
Do you understand?

201
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,810
That's it.

202
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,500
That's all I know about Ging.

203
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,640
Ging...

204
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,050
Ging, huh?

205
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,050
Ging... Ging...

206
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,860
Yeah, I'll use that.

207
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,130
Hey, Mito-san...

208
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,770
Tell me more about

209
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,890
what Ging was like when he was little!

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,810
Huh?

211
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,460
Does it sound weird for me
to use his name?

212
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,020
Somehow, it feels more natural.

213
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,790
No, that isn't it.

214
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,940
You want to hear what Ging
was like as a child?

215
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,040
Yeah!

216
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,250
Hey, did Ging have any friends his age?

217
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,610
No, he didn't.

218
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,050
Ging and I were the only children around.

219
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,490
So I always wanted him to play with me,

220
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,890
but he would always run off.

221
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,600
You were always getting lost.

222
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,070
Honestly, you only remember
the embarrassing stuff!

223
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,030
You followed Ging into the mountains,

224
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,140
but then you didn't come back.

225
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,090
When Ging returned by himself,

226
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,020
the whole village panicked.
And that happened several times.

227
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,550
But when we went to look
for you in the mountains,

228
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,300
Ging was always the first to find you.

229
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,590
No matter where you hid...

230
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,590
After a few times,

231
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,270
people started wondering if you
two were just playing pranks.

232
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,460
What?!

233
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,920
I would never do that!

234
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,660
Well, you always hid in places

235
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,930
that were impossible to locate.

236
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,880
It was like you didn't want to be found.

237
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,580
Really?

238
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,020
I guess so...

239
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,800
Oh, that reminds me of this other time.

240
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,250
Ging and I were...

241
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,090
Oh?

242
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,290
I see.

243
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,810
So this is the box.

244
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,040
Huh?

245
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,150
How do you open it?

246
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,590
Yeah, I tried a bunch of methods,

247
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,280
but it wouldn't open.

248
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,500
Mind if I use force?

249
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,810
Go ahead.

250
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,400
Okay...

251
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,050
It's no use.

252
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,770
This is no ordinary box.

253
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,840
I should be able to twist
open an ordinary steel box.

254
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,040
And since we don't know what's inside,
we can't break the box.

255
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,480
It's not making a sound.

256
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,050
Your dad said

257
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,690
to give this to you once you
became a Hunter, right?

258
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,450
Yeah, that's what I heard.

259
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,380
Once you became a Hunter...

260
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,600
I get it...

261
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
I figured it out!

262
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,860
Gon, there's one thing we haven't tried yet!

263
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,800
Huh?

264
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,810
Something you have as a Hunter
that you didn't have before.

265
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,110
Oh, I know!

266
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,360
My Hunter License!

267
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,250
But there isn't an opening for the card...

268
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,220
No, that isn't it.

269
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,600
I meant Nen...

270
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,500
There's another box inside.

271
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,950
These are just steel plates.

272
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,320
It appears nothing was connecting them.

273
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,630
What's wrong?

274
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,080
Doesn't that design

275
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,950
look familiar?

276
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,080
This is...

277
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,210
I know!

278
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,300
This is like the pattern on the promise
thread Wing-san gave me.

279
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,760
Wasn't that designed

280
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,720
to snap if Nen was used?

281
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,020
I bet this pattern holds a
power similar to Nen.

282
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,730
Maybe we're supposed

283
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,200
to put the card in here now.

284
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,250
It worked!

285
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,310
Bingo!

286
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,990
A ring

287
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,960
and a cassette tape...

288
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
And a memory card?

289
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,000
Look.

290
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,350
That pattern is on the back of this ring.

291
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,830
You should take care before you put it on.

292
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,090
Really?

293
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,500
You think that Ging

294
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,140
might try to hurt me?

295
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,510
Just to be safe.

296
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,480
Well, we can start by listening to the tape.

297
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,800
I guess.

298
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Oh, can you copy it?

299
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,770
Sure, why?

300
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,700
Just to be safe.

301
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,340
Yo, Gon...

302
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,640
So you became a Hunter, too.

303
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,360
Anyway, I have a question for you.

304
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,520
Do you want to see me?

305
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,650
It was the first time Gon had
heard his father's voice.

306
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,070
Ging appeared

307
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,840
to have read Gon's mind

308
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,280
when he recorded his question.

309
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

310
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

311
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

312
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

313
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

314
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

315
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

316
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

317
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:19,960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

318
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,290
Today, we introduce Mito-san!

319
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,400
She raised me.

320
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,780
Raised Gon and has been
waiting on Whale Island

321
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,820
To me, Mito-san will always be my mom.

322
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,450
for Gon to return.

323
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,440
I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...

324
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,960
Ging's cousin and
childhood friend.

325
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,270
She's the best,

326
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,510
though she nags a lot!

327
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,870
Next Time: Reply x From x Dad!

328
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,120
Earthquake, thunderstorm, fire, or Dad.

329
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
Which one scares you most?

330
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,220
Mito-san.
