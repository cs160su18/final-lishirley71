00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,100
Right now, I'm letting you live.

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,040
Until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

11
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,550
I'll only take it back

12
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,440
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

13
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,850
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

14
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,450
Trap x In The x Hole

15
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,360
Gon was humiliated,

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,340
after Hisoka recovered the tags
taken by Gerreta.

17
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,760
As for Killua...

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
You're wasting your time.

19
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,980
I'll never give you an opening to attack.

20
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,250
Tremble with fear.

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,280
Wear yourself out.

22
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,100
I am a very cautious man.

23
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,530
I go to any lengths necessary,

24
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,040
even when facing a child.

25
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,170
Once he exhausts himself,
and has no choice but to sleep,

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,830
I'll attack!

27
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,970
I am a very cautious man.

28
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,050
Man...

29
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,070
If you're not gonna show yourself,
I'll come to you.

30
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,060
Huh?

31
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,560
What a pain...

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,060
You're only worth one point to me.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,190
He wants to fight?

34
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,420
I can't possibly lose, right?

35
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,950
He's just a kid.

36
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,180
But...

37
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,620
Why is he so calm?

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,710
Is he really that strong?

39
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,180
Right... I am a very cautious man.

40
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,710
I should esca—

41
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,760
I mean, I should back off.

42
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,130
But...

43
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,660
My brothers will yell at me!

44
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,960
Actually, if I go back without
taking his tag,

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,140
they'll definitely yell at me!

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,400
Bro!

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,520
We ran into some trouble.

48
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,660
You're done, right?

49
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,940
You idiot!

50
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,790
You can't even beat a little kid?

51
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,690
Y-You got it wrong, Amo!

52
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,300
What do I have wrong?

53
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,970
I-I didn't want to hurt a little kid.

54
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,740
So I figured I'd take it while he slept.

55
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,180
You're lying through your teeth!

56
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,430
F-Fine!

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,530
If you insist, that leaves me no choice.

58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,190
Time for a beat down.

59
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,210
If I start to lose,

60
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,450
my brothers will come to my aid.

61
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,990
Hey, kid.

62
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,710
Just give me your tag.

63
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,020
Do as I say, and I won't hurt you.

64
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,210
Stupid.

65
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,330
Aw, don't say I didn't warn you.

66
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,520
Right in the gut.

67
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
Must hurt like a bitch.

68
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Huh?

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,720
What?

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,460
Did you go easy on him?

71
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,780
You're too nice, Imori.

72
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,610
Y-Yeah...

73
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,620
#198, huh?

74
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,150
What? No way...

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,010
Since it's only a number off
from the one I'm after,

76
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,250
maybe #199 is one of your two buddies?

77
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,480
Umori...

78
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,950
Yeah.

79
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,010
Get in formation.

80
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,930
Time to get serious.

81
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,270
This is no ordinary kid.

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,310
It doesn't matter how strong he is.

83
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,420
He stands no chance
against our teamwork.

84
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,950
We three have

85
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,430
defeated many tough opponents
with this formation.

86
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,700
Just you wait...

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,180
We're gonna rip you to shreds.

88
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,950
A-Above?

89
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,680
Don't move.

90
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,710
My fingers are sharper than knives.

91
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,210
Huh?

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,250
You're #197?

93
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,780
I'm so bad at guessing these things...

94
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,600
Hey.

95
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,850
Are you #199?

96
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,970
Yeah...

97
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,940
Hand it over.

98
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,790
Thanks.

99
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,240
Now, for the tags I don't need...

100
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,630
And the other one goes this way.

101
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,570
You still have three days.

102
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,330
Good luck finding them.

103
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,800
See ya.

104
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,350
Damn it!

105
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,510
#197 was always accompanied by #199...

106
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,600
I didn't expect that little kid to
deal with them for me.

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,260
Good thing I was watching
from the shadows.

108
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,750
Made it easy to grab the tag I wanted...

109
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,530
The kid noticed I was there...

110
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,970
I've failed...

111
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,050
Man, that was boring.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,310
Wonder what Gon's doing.

113
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:47,140
Hunter Vocabulary

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,140
Too Bad

115
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,010
Six days have passed.

116
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,370
Only one day left...

117
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,850
It's been four days since
we ran into Hisoka.

118
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,990
And we haven't seen anyone else.

119
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,350
Wanna head back to the starting point?

120
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,310
It's possible that people have
already finished.

121
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,840
No, we won't find anyone there.

122
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,270
This phase is unique because

123
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,190
you have a chance to recover
your tag if you lose it.

124
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,860
On the other hand,

125
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,300
you might have six points
in tags right now.

126
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,290
But that doesn't guarantee you'll have
them when the phase ends.

127
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
You can't finish it early.

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,660
I see.

129
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,460
But it's worth a shot.

130
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,770
Only one day remains.

131
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,800
People who already have six points

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,430
will be inclined to wait near the goal.

133
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,970
I would do the same.

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,520
Okay, let's go.

135
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,380
Well? Anyone there?

136
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,500
No...

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,580
No one that can be easily spotted.

138
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,120
Damn...

139
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,980
Perhaps we should split up to search,

140
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,190
after we decide on a time and
place to reconvene.

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,390
It'll go faster with three people.

142
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,370
Gon!

143
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,600
I guess we all had the same idea.

144
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,620
I've been watching from up above,
and a number of people are nearby.

145
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,780
Really?

146
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,710
I see... We should search from above.

147
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,140
That won't work.

148
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,490
It's only possible if you have eyes
as sharp as Gon's.

149
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,360
Gon.

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,070
Huh?

151
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,320
Do you have the tags you need?

152
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,990
Yeah, I guess...

153
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,740
Damn, so I'm the only one
without enough points.

154
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,900
Who's your target?

155
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,890
#246, a woman named Ponzu.

156
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,260
I heard that she uses chemical weapons.

157
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,530
Gon, did you see any women
when you were up there?

158
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,200
Nope.

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,310
I see.

160
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,280
We can assume that there
are four possibilities.

161
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,260
She's in good shape,
and she still has her tag.

162
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,730
She's in good shape,
but she's lost her tag.

163
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,750
She's out of action,
but she still has her tag.

164
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,990
She's out of action,
and she doesn't have her tag.

165
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,790
Is it really likely

166
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,680
that she'd still have her tag
if she's out of action?

167
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,890
If she were caught in a sudden accident,

168
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,800
or if she were defeated after
hiding the tag.

169
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,860
If she died after concealing her tag,

170
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,420
we won't be able to find it.

171
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,260
Sounding grimmer by the second.

172
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,400
Hey, do you know anything
else about Ponzu?

173
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,060
Does she wear a special perfume,

174
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,310
like Leorio with his cologne?

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,610
Oh, that's right.

176
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,360
Gon can follow her scent!

177
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,280
But she might not wear perfume.

178
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,720
He can smell the chemicals she uses.

179
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,670
She's known for using drugs, right?

180
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,020
Some of them must have strong scents.

181
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,250
Well, Gon?

182
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,920
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

183
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,990
That's why I'm here.

184
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Is she in there, Gon?

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,350
Yep, definitely.

186
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,210
What do you want to do?

187
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,150
I'm going inside.

188
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,410
You guys, wait here.

189
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,690
There don't appear to be any traps.

190
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,440
I'll head inside.

191
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,360
Don't enter until I give the okay.

192
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,440
Thirty minutes.

193
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,950
Huh?

194
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,030
If we don't hear anything from you
after thirty minutes,

195
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,170
we're coming in.

196
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,720
Yeah.

197
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,700
Unacceptable.

198
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,000
If that happens, you guys
should return to the start.

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,710
I can't do that.

200
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,800
Since we've teamed up,

201
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,140
I won't abandon you now.

202
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,470
Then I quit the team.

203
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,660
It's selfish, considering all the
help you've given me,

204
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,450
but I'll do this alone.

205
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,820
No.

206
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,510
What did you say?!

207
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,610
We're staying here, no matter
what you say.

208
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,540
Still got a problem?

209
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,660
Do whatever you want.

210
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,960
Hold onto that for me.

211
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,860
I have to go for it...

212
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,760
Isn't that...

213
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,110
Bourbon?

214
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm guessing that

215
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,430
I'm your target?

216
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,700
Ponzu!

217
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,540
There's no point.

218
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,420
We gain nothing by fighting here.

219
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,210
I have everything to gain.

220
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,170
It's just as you said...

221
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,240
You're my target!

222
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,780
Let's pretend that a miracle occurs,

223
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,530
and you defeat me.

224
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,540
You still won't be able
to leave this cave.

225
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,060
What?

226
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,920
What do you mean?

227
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,810
He's taking too long.

228
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,540
Is Leorio okay?

229
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,310
Yeah.

230
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,510
It's been nearly thirty minutes.

231
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,320
Kurapika! Gon!

232
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,570
Don't come in!

233
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,580
Leorio!

234
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,080
Leorio!

235
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,300
You fools...

236
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,600
Why did you enter the cave?

237
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,480
He has bites all over his body!

238
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,100
If those snakes were venomous...

239
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,000
They're vipers.

240
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,740
Their poison isn't that strong.

241
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,860
But he's been bitten
too many times!

242
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,250
S-Stop it!

243
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,200
If you have any cavities or
open wounds in your mouth...

244
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
No problem!

245
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,200
Leorio, do you have any
serums in here?

246
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,820
If I did,

247
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,680
I could have saved you guys...

248
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,810
Leorio!

249
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,240
Anyway, we have to stop the bleeding.

250
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,140
Uh-huh!

251
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,720
That should do it.

252
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
We need to take him to a doctor!

253
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,320
I would stop if I were you.

254
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,910
You cannot leave.

255
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,830
What do you mean?

256
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,950
When someone tries to exit this cave,

257
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
snakes attack them.

258
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,240
Bourbon, the snake charmer,
set this trap.

259
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,880
If you're bitten,

260
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,190
you'll end up paralyzed like he is.

261
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,480
And then you'll die.

262
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,320
Bourbon!

263
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,130
You're looking for tags, right?

264
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,950
We'll give you every tag
in our possession.

265
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,190
So let us out of here!

266
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,700
It's no use.

267
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,380
He's already dead.

268
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,140
D-Dead?

269
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,810
Gon and his friends have
been caught in Bourbon

270
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,230
the snake charmer's trap,
and can't leave the cave.

271
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,480
Will they pass the Hunter Exam?

272
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,120
Will Leorio survive the
venomous snake bites?

273
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,900
Next time: Big x Time x Interview!

274
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,640
Thank you, Kurapika.

275
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,310
Thank you, Gon.
