2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,140
Lead all the soldiers here on a mission

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,720
to capture my food...

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,900
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,990
At once!

6
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,030
Very x Rapid x Reproduction

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,700
Class-1 quarantined insects

8
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,420
and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.

9
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,880
Once they've evolved beyond
two meters in length,

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,920
humans no longer stand a chance.

11
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,830
Hey, what's that?

12
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,700
M-M-Monsters!

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,880
Listen carefully!

14
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,010
Target the fully grown ones.
They will provide the most nutrition.

15
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,950
Now go!

16
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,080
A Chimera Ant queen

17
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,030
moves repeatedly until she
finds a place she likes.

18
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,450
As she does, she births more and more
soldier ants to build her own army.

19
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,420
Once she's chosen a location,

20
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,080
she births a large number of carpenter ants,
which construct her castle with incredible speed.

21
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,510
From then on, the queen remains
within the castle until death.

22
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,610
So if a Queen grew to two meters tall

23
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,020
and were to set her sights on humans,

24
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,350
there should be entire villages
or towns of missing people.

25
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,870
I don't see anything...

26
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,910
I just checked the past six months,

27
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,460
and the largest group only numbered ten.

28
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,840
Say, can we look up missing people individually?

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,670
Don't be ridiculous.

30
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,210
You know how many hundreds of thousands
of people go missing worldwide?

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,320
We should be able to see which areas
have the highest concentrations.

32
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,470
No good... The data's two years old.

33
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,500
Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,810
If someone saw a two-meter insect,
they'd make a big fuss.

35
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,600
We tried that, of course.

36
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,480
But we couldn't find anything.

37
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,360
Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...

38
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,100
Yeah.

39
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,660
Bring up the tidal data from
the day the arm was found.

40
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,170
The arm was discovered here...

41
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,570
Now go back ten days.

42
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,260
Locate any currents that may have carried
the arm to that location in that time.

43
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,860
What do you mean?

44
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,700
It's possible that the arm

45
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,670
was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.

46
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,850
That makes sense.

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,020
It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...

48
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,520
Including the Mitene Union.

49
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,990
The Mitene Union...

50
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,280
Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is.

51
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,530
Yes, as well as East Gorteau.

52
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,150
There's no getting information
out of those two countries.

53
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,040
What's this NGL?

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,420
An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life.

55
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,980
It's a country founded by people who wanted to
live in nature, away from machine civilization.

56
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,550
Here.

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:35,180
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,060
They primarily communicate by letter.

59
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,080
Primary means of transportation is by horse.

60
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,180
Anyone knowingly bringing technology into
the country is subject to execution.

61
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,300
In '87,

62
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,720
a three-man TV crew was caught trying
to enter the country to get a story.

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,190
One was executed, and the
other two remain in prison.

64
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,550
Of its 2.17 million population,
99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,

65
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,530
with the rest being support volunteers.

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,080
If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,760
how would the NGL citizenry react?

68
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,410
They probably wouldn't do anything.

69
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,670
When a deadly epidemic spread throughout
the area, they let nature run its course,

70
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,720
refusing to admit international doctors.

71
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,150
And even if they tried to contact the outside,
it would be too late by the time word arrived.

72
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,750
If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,

73
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,790
she may have already begun to build her nest.

74
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,690
A contest?

75
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,240
Yeah...

76
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,490
Between you and me.

77
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,620
Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.

78
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,130
I challenge you!

79
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,050
Hmph.

80
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,040
What?

81
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
You're running away?

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey, accept my challenge!

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,380
Accept?

84
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,510
Are you issuing an order?

85
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,390
Why should I follow an order from you?

86
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,390
I can only follow the Queen's orders.

87
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,450
You're just scared of losing.

88
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,490
My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.

89
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,150
I can beat any squadron in this castle!

90
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,020
Oh, I know...

91
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,190
I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.

92
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,290
If we all compete, we'll capture more prey.

93
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,010
More prey?

94
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,530
I see...

95
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,470
I agree with that idea.

96
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,300
If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased.

97
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,560
Okay, that settles it.

98
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,900
However, I believe that the
prey's quality also matters.

99
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,340
We must ensure that the Queen
eats highly nutritious humans.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,560
That guy's such a stiff...

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,810
That's what makes him endearing.

102
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,250
He is dedicated and loyal.

103
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,070
I presume the human he was created
from was also quite earnest.

104
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,890
Hey, wait!

105
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,230
Weren't you supposed to get some rest?

106
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,780
I'll bring her back.

107
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,740
Don't bother, it won't help.

108
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,330
But she goes to the forest every morning,

109
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,660
and she spends the whole day searching.

110
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,490
Right, she'll probably collapse soon...

111
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,750
But she can't stop looking.

112
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,810
That's what it means to be a parent.

113
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,270
How many days has it been since
Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?

114
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,920
It's like spirits whisked them away.

115
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,040
Big bugs...

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,150
Huh?

117
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,280
We haven't raided this area yet.

118
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,280
Mom!

119
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,250
It must be them...

120
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Those monsters must have stolen your children!

121
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,970
Excellent.

122
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,970
This should suffice to please the Queen.

123
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,230
Wh-What's happening?

124
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,730
Exterminate the insects quickly.

125
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,740
That's Gyro's order.

126
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,990
Gyro? What's that?

127
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,570
Our king's name!

128
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,700
Damn!

129
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,720
I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.

130
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,990
But to reach NGL, we have to

131
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,710
take an airship to the neighboring
Republic of Rokario,

132
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,230
and travel by land from there.

133
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,690
It "ant" gonna be easy to get into
a country of such nasty rumors.

134
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,480
Just kidding.

135
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,490
Nasty rumors?

136
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,490
What do you mean?

137
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,870
Have you heard of D²?

138
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,240
D²?

139
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,750
It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly
throughout urban areas worldwide.

140
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,410
It's derived from the bila tree,
native to the Mitene Union.

141
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,120
And they claim

142
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,510
that over 80% of the world's
bila trees are located in NGL.

143
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,020
So the nasty rumors are saying that the
drug is being manufactured in NGL?

144
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,360
They're only rumors.

145
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,350
No one has been able to publicly prove it.

146
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,520
After all, the country's locked down tight.

147
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,030
When people try to get in to
investigate, they're executed.

148
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,730
Executed...

149
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,530
He wasn't executed?

150
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,120
No, if he'd been captured trying
to uncover NGL's secrets,

151
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,170
he'd have probably been executed
like that TV crewman.

152
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,130
But this reporter was wearing a wire,

153
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,160
from which we intercepted the final message.

154
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,430
When the message was played...

155
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,720
M-Monsters...

156
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,410
Giant bugs!

157
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,440
Giant bugs?

158
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,150
What do you think?

159
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,680
That isn't enough information to be sure...

160
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,080
As a Magical Beast Hunter,
I'll have to see for myself.

161
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,900
Then that settles it.

162
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,140
I'll get three tickets.

163
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,330
Make it four.

164
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,460
Ponzu...

165
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,150
I'm coming with you.

166
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,910
You can't.

167
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,220
This is too dangerous,

168
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,690
and you don't have a professional license yet.

169
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,930
And we're talking about NGL...

170
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,470
That's why I should come.

171
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,130
You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.

172
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,000
If they discover you with cell phones
or wireless communicators,

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
you'll be arrested right away.

174
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,180
So if there's any trouble, you'll need me...

175
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,380
Or rather, you'll need them.

176
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,120
They can carry a letter anywhere.

177
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,500
I get it.

178
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,180
They'll certainly come in handy.

179
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,530
It may be a bit late to ask,

180
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,890
but are you sure you want to come?

181
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,020
Of course!

182
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,390
You weren't kidding about the "late" part.

183
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,400
We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.

184
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,560
There may very well be a swarm
of giant Chimera Ants already,

185
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,830
hunting humans down.

186
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,410
If that turns out to be the case,

187
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,710
my priority will be saving them.

188
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,420
So I may not be able to help you.

189
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,060
You must be able to protect yourselves.

190
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,210
If you want to come, that's the requirement.

191
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,930
Okay, got it.

192
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,920
We'll be fine.

193
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,740
And if I'm the one who's in danger,

194
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,180
you should escape without me.

195
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,180
Got it?

196
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,490
A pretty good haul.

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,100
But it's not even half the size of
what my squadron delivered...

198
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,780
My focus was quality.

199
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,470
And I wasn't competing against you.

200
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
Whatever.

201
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,710
Anyway, did you hear?

202
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,600
That turtle guy ran into human resistance.

203
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,600
Resistance?

204
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Hmm,

205
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,480
those were probably guns.

206
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,900
Guns?

207
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,750
Put simply, it's a barrel that launches
metal projectiles called bullets

208
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,860
using the explosive force of gunpowder.

209
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,610
It's one of the most commonly
used human weapons.

210
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,620
No idea what you're talking about...

211
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,410
If you want the details, read books.

212
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,700
Books are wonderful.

213
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,990
You can learn about how these
human creatures think,

214
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,380
behave, and function as a society.

215
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,070
Can you answer my question, then?

216
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,780
Do humans have armies too?

217
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,970
Armies?

218
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,470
Yes, that was an army.

219
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,810
They belong to a military body
led by an authoritative figure,

220
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,570
much like ourselves!

221
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,780
Ah, I have another question.

222
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,800
They mentioned something about a name.

223
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,060
A name?

224
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,780
I can't blame you for not understanding.

225
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,290
Because it's a human idea
we do not make use of.

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
Put simply...

227
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,450
So it seems there are humans

228
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,550
capable of more than running and crying.

229
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't know why that should surprise you.

230
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,060
Given how different you and I are,

231
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,650
it's only natural that individual humans
would have unique traits as well.

232
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,980
After all, their blood flows through us.

233
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,240
Assemble, squadron leaders!

234
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,270
Assemble, squadron leaders!

235
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,500
The Queen summons us.

236
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,120
Assemble, squadron leaders!

237
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,980
Do you get a headache when
the Queen calls to us?

238
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah, my ears start ringing.

239
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,850
It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.

240
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,380
I shall now begin preparations
for the King's birth.

241
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,410
Every day, provide me with fifty humans.

242
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,580
Yes, Majesty!

243
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,980
Your Majesty, may I ask a question?

244
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,420
Permitted. Speak.

245
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,670
Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,

246
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,550
with weapons to use against us.

247
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,020
We must fortify our defenses,

248
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,470
in preparation for any potential attack.

249
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,420
I have a few ideas...
Would you care to hear them?

250
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,190
I shall let you decide your course.

251
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,740
I must focus entirely on my son.

252
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,570
Yes, and one more thing...

253
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,080
Would you allow us to have names?

254
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
What is a name?

255
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:31,250
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.

256
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,090
Very well, do as you like.

257
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,780
I am truly grateful!

258
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,310
How peculiar.

259
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,990
They speak their minds and
request to use these names.

260
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,140
While bettering the race, they compete for glory,

261
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,810
leading to a stronger sense of individuality.

262
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,740
I suppose I am also peculiar to
find this change fascinating.

263
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,120
Perhaps I, too, have traces
of human blood within me.

264
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,380
Regardless, I feel quite confident now.

265
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,390
I can see you already, as though
recalling a memory from my past.

266
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,570
My King...

267
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,650
You shall stand atop this world!

268
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,410
Names... Quite amusing.

269
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,480
The King's three Royal Guards.

270
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,240
I shall name you myself.

271
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,170
What did you just decide?

272
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,090
Remember what Kite said before we left?

273
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,010
That we should escape without
him if he's in danger.

274
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,490
Yeah, I don't think it was a choice...

275
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,310
Yeah.

276
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,510
That's why neither of us said anything,

277
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,860
but I've been thinking.

278
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,650
Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,

279
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,150
to be in that much danger?

280
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,360
You said that Ging had a reason for
bringing Kite and me together...

281
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,250
Yeah.

282
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,460
You're probably right.

283
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,810
I don't know the reason,

284
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,250
but I can't give up halfway,
no matter what's going on.

285
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,470
Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging.

286
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,700
Of course, I could never forgive myself, either.

287
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,640
So I won't run away.

288
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,150
That's what I've decided.

289
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,730
Man,

290
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,270
you had this totally serious expression,

291
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,670
so I was expecting something big.

292
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,520
But it's just business as usual.

293
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
Huh? I thought about this a lot.

294
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,780
I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...

295
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,310
Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon.

296
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,750
If someone said you should abandon them,

297
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,640
you'd never do it.

298
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,170
You make it sound like I wasted
my time considering it.

299
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,600
Then what about you?

300
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think
about it when the time comes.

301
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,850
You mean you might run away?

302
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,600
Depends.

303
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,770
I can't say until it actually happens.

304
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,360
Say for instance...

305
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,600
I can't tell you what I'd do in
a hypothetical situation.

306
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,820
I don't decide until it's time.

307
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,530
The airship carrying the group
heads for the Mitene Union,

308
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,120
still unaware of the cruel fate
that lies in wait for them...

309
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,800
Next time: No x Good x NGL.

310
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,550
Ready, start!

311
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,760
Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur...

312
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,010
And there's your outtake!
