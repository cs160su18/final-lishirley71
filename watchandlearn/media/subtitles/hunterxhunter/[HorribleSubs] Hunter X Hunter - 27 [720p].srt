00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,850
Train and earn money?

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,480
The Heavens Arena.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,670
Heavens Arena...

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,330
Yeah, I'll explain later.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,360
We should get moving.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,190
Okay!

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,020
Whoa.

9
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,490
Look, it's huge!

10
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,080
Yep.

11
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,510
That's Heavens Arena.

12
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,590
Two hundred and fifty-one stories.

13
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,080
Nine hundred, ninety-one meters tall.

14
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,050
The world's fourth tallest building.

15
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,990
So this is where we'll be training...

16
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,110
I used up all my money on the trip fare.

17
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,700
We'll have to make more here.

18
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,610
After we disembark, we'll start from zero.

19
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,610
Okay, got it.

20
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,920
Good... Let's go.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
Yeah!

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Arrival x At The x Arena

23
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,670
Gon and Killua

24
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,760
head to Heavens Arena,
seeking to get stronger.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,630
Gon.

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,050
There's a really long line.

27
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,760
Everyone's going to Heavens Arena?

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
There aren't any conditions here,

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,780
like there were for the Hunter Exam.

30
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,990
You just have to defeat your opponent.

31
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,490
Oh...

32
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,910
The higher you go, the more
prize money you earn.

33
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,380
This is as good as it gets for those looking

34
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,360
to make a living with their fists.

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,110
Welcome to Heavens Arena.

36
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,120
Please fill out this form.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,620
Killua Zoldyck-sama, you are #2054.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,500
Gon Freecss-sama, you are #2055.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,160
They'll call your number

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,120
on the first floor of the arena,

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,050
so make sure you remember it.

42
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,570
Then please go ahead.

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,490
Go!

44
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,530
Take him out!

45
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,840
It's been a while,

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,370
but the place hasn't changed.

47
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,530
Huh? You've been here before?

48
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah, when I was six.

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,430
My dad left me here without a penny.

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,580
He said I should reach floor 200
before coming home.

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,500
It took two years.

52
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,290
Two years...

53
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,550
Sure, he was only six, but it
really took Killua that long?

54
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,290
If you want to fight people of Hisoka's level,

55
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,520
you'll need to go higher.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,370
Let's hurry.

57
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,560
Okay.

58
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,150
#1973.

59
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,460
#2055.

60
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,810
Please enter ring E.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,230
#2055! That's me!

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,810
I'm getting nervous now.

63
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,950
Gon, you got through the
Testing Gate, right?

64
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,660
Huh?

65
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,910
In that case...

66
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,220
Look at that! It's a little boy!

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,620
Hey, kid!

68
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,170
This is your last chance to run!

69
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,820
This ain't a game!

70
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,550
One punch, and he'll fly out of the ring!

71
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,680
On the first floor, we appraise
each participant's level.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,980
You are allowed three minutes

73
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,960
to demonstrate your prowess.

74
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,310
Then... Begin!

75
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,060
Sorry...

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,910
I'll end your suffering with one punch.

77
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,900
You got through the Testing Gate, right?

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,990
In that case, all you have
to do is push hard.

79
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,950
Just push

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,450
hard!

81
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,870
No way!

82
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,080
Yes!

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,640
That kid's incredible!

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,590
He's got some crazy power!

85
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,970
When did I become so strong?

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,820
#2055, proceed to floor 50.

87
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,350
All right!

88
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,100
Hey, here's another kid who's a beast!

89
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,350
Oh?

90
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,320
You've already been to the 200th floor?

91
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,880
And this was a strong performance.

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
Very well. You may go to the 180th floor...

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,810
Oh, I'll start from the 50th floor.

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,630
Huh?

95
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,380
I want to take it easy.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
That's enough!

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,070
Yet another strong kid there!

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,100
You are permitted to
advance to the 50th floor.

99
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,020
Osu!

100
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,170
The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena

101
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,780
are divided into classes,
each comprised of ten floors.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,620
So after someone defeats an
opponent in the 50s,

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,280
they advance to the 60s.

104
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,400
If they lose, then they'd
drop back to the 40s.

105
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, so that's how it works.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,960
Plus...

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,570
I've heard that

108
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,540
after you pass the 100th floor,
you get your own room!

109
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,210
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

110
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,050
Osu! My name is Zushi!

111
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,470
What about you guys?

112
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,790
I'm Killua.

113
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,860
I'm Gon.

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,060
Nice to meet you.

115
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,390
We've arrived at the 50th floor.

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,260
I saw your fight earlier.

117
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,090
That was really amazing, yo!

118
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,750
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,190
You made it up here with one match, too.

120
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,320
That's right.

121
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
No...

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,430
I still have a long way to go.

123
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,240
By the way, which martial arts
discipline do you practice?

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,830
I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.

125
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,590
School? We don't have one, right?

126
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,330
No...

127
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,630
What?

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,870
You're that strong with no training?

129
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,270
I'm kind of shocked...

130
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,870
I still have so far to go!

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
Zushi.

132
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,480
You did well.

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Master!

134
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,970
You adhered to my teachings.

135
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,940
Osu! I am honored!

136
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,730
Master, your shirt is untucked again.

137
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Oh, sorry about that...

138
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,470
Who are they?

139
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,740
Oh, these are Killua-san and Gon-san.

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,740
Nice to meet you. I'm Wing.

141
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,260
Yo!

142
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,230
I didn't expect to meet other children.

143
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,250
Why are you here?

144
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,470
Uh...

145
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,130
Well, we want to become stronger.

146
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,930
But we're also broke,

147
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,460
so we're making money simultaneously.

148
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,010
Killua's a veteran here.

149
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,390
Oh?

150
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,840
If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled,

151
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,050
but you should pay strict attention

152
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,600
to your opponent's body,
as well as your own.

153
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,730
Osu

154
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,800
Killua-sama, Gon-sama, and Zushi-sama?

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,490
Please hand me your tickets.

156
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,030
Here is your prize money.

157
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,170
One hundred, fifty-two jenny...

158
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,080
On the 1st floor, win or lose,

159
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,020
your reward covers a canned drink.

160
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,590
But beyond that,

161
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,100
a loss gets you nothing.

162
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,270
A win over an opponent in the 50s
nets you fifty thousand.

163
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,460
Fifty thousand...

164
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,360
That's a lot.

165
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,600
In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million.

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,580
What?

167
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,040
Once you're past the 150th floor,

168
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,150
you get ten million a pop.

169
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,760
Ten million?

170
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,490
Didn't you make it to floor 200
when you were here before?

171
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,450
Th-The 200th floor?

172
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,900
How much do you get for
winning on the 200th floor?

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,670
Well... I don't really know,

174
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,890
because I quit once I reached 200.

175
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,460
But when I was winning in the 190s,

176
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,460
I had around two hundred million, total.

177
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,630
T-Two hundred million...

178
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,170
Where's that money now?

179
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,970
That was four years ago.

180
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,640
Of course it's gone now.

181
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,560
Spent it all on snacks!

182
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,810
Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?

183
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,560
What kind of snacks are these?

184
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,460
Hey, let's head to the waiting room.

185
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,060
We didn't take any damage in the last fight,

186
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,780
so they'll probably assign us
another match today.

187
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,820
Well, these opponents should be a cinch.

188
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,090
Just take it easy.

189
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,080
Really?

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,010
Killua-san!

191
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,840
You're too loud...

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,920
#2054, Killua-sama.

193
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,090
I'm already up.

194
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,440
And #1963, Zushi-sama.

195
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,220
What?

196
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,840
Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor.

197
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh.

198
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,910
Osu! I shall give it my best.

199
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,410
Sure. Well, you can't win them all.

200
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,080
Better luck next time.

201
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,810
I'll head out.

202
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,650
Yeah. Good luck, guys.

203
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,240
I'll wait for you above.

204
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,410
Uh-huh...

205
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,190
He really didn't have to be so blunt...

206
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay, everyone!

207
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
The event you've all been waiting for!

208
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
We have a unique match-up for you!

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,330
Two young boys, fighting it out!

210
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,750
However, you don't want to
underestimate them!

211
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,730
Both had strong showings
in their first rounds!

212
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,270
They both advanced directly to the 50s!

213
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,990
We will now replay

214
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,850
their matches on the big screen!

215
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,990
Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!

216
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,910
One chop was all it took to knock him out!

217
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,240
Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,940
to punish his opponent,

219
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,420
scoring a flawless knockout
of a 200+ kilogram giant!

220
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,800
Okay, everyone!

221
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,460
Are you ready to press
your gamble switches?

222
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,180
In that case, switch on!

223
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,650
All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!

224
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,520
Perhaps his martial arts
knowledge gives him an edge?

225
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,300
This is bad...

226
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,440
Killua-san is mad...

227
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,250
This match will consist of three,
three-minutes each,

228
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,310
decided by the points and knockout system!

229
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,200
Begin!

230
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,200
I see.

231
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
His stance leaves few openings.

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,960
He's trained long and hard
to master that stance.

233
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,960
But he has no chance against me.

234
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,710
Wow... Killua is

235
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,720
boldly walking toward his opponent!

236
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,920
Sorry.

237
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,620
But I'm sticking to one chop per
match until I reach the 150s.

238
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,310
Clean hit!

239
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,120
Amazing!

240
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,830
Killua has knocked out another
opponent with only a single chop!

241
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,650
A clean hit and being knocked
down get him 2 point.

242
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,440
As you already know, under the
points and knockout system,

243
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,340
There are clean hits, critical hits,
and knockdowns.

244
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,990
Superb attacks count as "clean hits,"
worth one point apiece.

245
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,610
Unusually superb attacks

246
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,980
are classified as "critical hits,"
worth two points.

247
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,170
Knocking down your opponent
earns you one point.

248
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,270
After amassing ten points, you are
awarded a technical knockout.

249
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,750
Of course, if your opponent cannot
continue to fight after one hit,

250
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,250
you win due to a knockout!

251
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,430
That chop ended the fight, stupid.

252
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,890
Can you fight?

253
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,310
Yes, I'm okay!

254
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,380
He got up!

255
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,550
Zushi will continue!

256
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,150
Fight!

257
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Did I hold back too much?

258
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,830
He's taken another hit!

259
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,080
Zushi has been knocked down!

260
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,360
But he's already standing up!

261
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,300
If you stand before the referee reaches you,

262
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,340
your opponent isn't awarded the point.

263
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,280
Tsk. Not bad.

264
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,470
So the same attack won't
work twice against you.

265
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,790
But something's wrong.

266
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,580
That attack was strong enough that a graze

267
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,520
should have rendered him unconscious.

268
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,890
Unbelievable...

269
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,130
He has dominating power and speed!

270
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,530
At this rate, I won't stand a chance!

271
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
I have to...

272
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,530
try it!

273
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,930
Oh! What's happening?

274
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,270
Killua has backed away!

275
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,020
Zushi!

276
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,480
So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator

277
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,540
interrupted the fight,

278
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,300
but let's get started again!

279
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,550
Oh, Killua!

280
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,800
Over here!

281
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,330
See? I got sixty thousand.

282
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,440
How about you?

283
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,520
It took you a while to get here.

284
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Yeah, I ran into a little trouble.

285
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,140
Then Zushi was pretty strong.

286
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,070
No, not at all.

287
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,060
He has potential.

288
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,800
One day, he'll be strong.

289
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,070
But right now,

290
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,060
he's just target practice for me.

291
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,510
His punches were weak...

292
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,580
I was completely able to knock him around.

293
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,540
But I couldn't defeat him.

294
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,490
Huh?

295
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,010
I received the TKO from points,

296
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,470
but I couldn't knock him out.

297
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,220
Further...

298
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,560
When he changed his stance,

299
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,530
his aura reminded me of my brother's.

300
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,040
I don't know what it was,
but it felt dangerous.

301
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
It must be some kind of technique.

302
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,900
His master

303
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,340
called it "Ren."

304
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,950
Forgive me, Master!

305
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,550
I thought I made myself clear, Zushi.

306
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,670
You were not supposed to use Ren yet.

307
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,160
Forgive me!

308
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,210
My opponent was so strong,

309
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,920
I couldn't help myself...

310
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,540
Sure. Wanting to win is good.

311
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,970
But your true goal lies beyond this.

312
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,570
At this tower's top floor.

313
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,040
Focus too much on simply winning a fight,

314
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,420
and you reduce your own potential.

315
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Yo!

316
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,920
You must be prepared to lose a
thousand times while you're here.

317
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
Yo!

318
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,540
So he isn't supposed

319
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,000
to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?

320
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,210
The strongest fighters are at the top, right?

321
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,500
Gon, change in plans.

322
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,920
Huh?

323
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm aiming to reach the top floor!

324
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,240
Uh-huh!

325
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,630
Actually, that was my goal all along.

326
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,430
Killua defeats another opponent
with one chop!

327
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,110
A knockout!

328
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,070
Oh! In the other arena,

329
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,830
Gon has knocked out another opponent

330
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,580
with a single push!

331
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,350
Each of them has won six
consecutive matches

332
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,960
over the past three days,

333
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,230
to reach the 100s without a scratch!

334
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,710
Killua's chop.

335
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,690
And Gon's push.

336
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,950
How far will they be able to go?

337
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,500
And who is going to be able to stop them?

338
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,480
Yay! A private room!

339
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,490
We won't have to worry about
money and lodging anymore.

340
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,420
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

341
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,710
If you drop

342
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,320
below the 100s, you have to
check out of this room.

343
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,450
A world of difference separates making it

344
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,360
to the 100s and staying in the 100s.

345
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,640
The 100th floor is like a ceiling.

346
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,670
A ceiling?

347
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,470
Once you pass it, you get special treatment.

348
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,300
So everyone focuses on holding their spot.

349
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,780
Some people will do anything it takes

350
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,890
to stay in the 100s.

351
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,810
You can waste a lot of time on them.

352
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,400
Be careful, Gon.

353
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,360
Yeah.

354
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,770
Gon wins another match
with a single push!

355
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,480
Guess I didn't need to worry about him.

356
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,370
Your prize money has been deposited
into the specified account.

357
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,860
You were right...

358
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,680
I've never seen so many zeros before...

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,240
And just a week ago, I was totally broke.

360
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm a little annoyed.

361
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,690
Huh?

362
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,030
My first time here,

363
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,190
it took me two months to reach floor 150.

364
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,140
Meanwhile, you're breezing through.

365
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,700
But you were only six back then.

366
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,700
Well, that's true...

367
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,990
Oh, that's right.

368
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,130
I saw Zushi on TV earlier.

369
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,280
So did I.

370
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,560
He's still in the 50s.

371
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,590
I wonder what that Ren you sensed

372
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,550
could have been.

373
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,130
Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...

374
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,750
Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?

375
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,150
Ren is one of the four major principles.

376
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,320
The four major principles for
disciplining your mind and body.

377
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,160
Fundamental to every martial art!

378
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,780
You must know "Ten," learn "Zetsu,"

379
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,510
achieve "Ren," and reach "Hatsu"!

380
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,540
This is all part of "Nen" training!

381
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,670
That covers everything!

382
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,140
I've no idea what you just said!

383
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,790
Zushi...

384
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,130
Are you sufficiently educated
that you can teach others?

385
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,500
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.

386
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,070
There's an old saying

387
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,570
that if you learn something piecemeal,

388
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,810
you'll end up knowing less
than when you started.

389
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,630
So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?

390
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,320
But I want to know right now.

391
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,610
Because it's related to the secret
behind my brother's power.

392
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,830
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?

393
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,960
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!

394
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,460
I'll agree to the full learning process
rather than a quick explanation!

395
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,060
And if you're willing to teach me,

396
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,460
I won't try to figure it out myself.

397
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,470
I understand.

398
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,450
Come with me to my residence.

399
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,980
What is Nen? What is Ren?

400
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,120
Killua believes they are related
to his brother's abilities.

401
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,240
Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well.

402
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,030
Brush your teeth.
Unripe Fruit

403
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,030
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

404
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,860
Coming up, it's Gon

405
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,600
and Killua's

406
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,320
Hunterpedia!

407
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

408
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,350
and Killua's

409
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,030
Hunterpedia!

410
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,300
Today, we introduce Zushi!

411
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:16,410
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

412
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,740
Learning Shingen-ryu kung fu
from Wing.

413
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,340
He practices Shingen-ryu kung fu.

414
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,950
He's considered a one in a hundred thousand talent!

415
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,040
Very polite and earnest.

416
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,130
But we're considered one in a hundred million talents!

417
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,370
Likes to say "Osu."

418
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,790
Osu!

419
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,090
Next time: Nen x And x Ren!

420
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,890
That was a rough episode...

421
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,040
Good work!

422
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,760
Osu!
