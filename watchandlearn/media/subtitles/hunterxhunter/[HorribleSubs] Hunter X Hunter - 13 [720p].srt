00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,260
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,980
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

Letter x From x Gon

10
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,450
"Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?

11
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,290
I'm doing fine.

12
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,960
I just passed the Hunter
Exam's Third Phase.

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,230
Isn't that great?

14
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,010
But it's been a tough ride.

15
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,210
First, after leaving the island,

16
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,050
the boat I was on ran into a big storm.

17
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,860
But that's where I met
Leorio and Kurapika."

18
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,570
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.

19
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,660
That's three times now.

20
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,970
Step outside.

21
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,110
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline,
here and now.

22
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,800
Take that back, Leorio!

23
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,680
Take that back!

24
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,050
That's Leorio-san to you.

25
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,050
Take back what you said!

26
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,150
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.

27
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,670
How many times must I repeat myself?

28
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,490
You should show me some respect.

29
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,780
I won't back down.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,410
Then I have no choice...

31
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,010
Damn it!

32
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,560
Thanks, Gon!

33
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,940
You saved my life.

34
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,290
I couldn't have done it alone.

35
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,950
These two helped save you.

36
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,730
Huh?

37
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,180
Thank you very much!

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
No, you don't need to thank me.

39
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,200
Well...

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

41
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,340
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!

42
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,090
What?

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
I apologize for my rude behavior.

44
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,100
Sorry, Leorio-san.

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Wh-What's with the sudden change?

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,330
We sound like strangers...

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,110
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.

48
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,580
I'm also sorry.

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,470
I take back everything I said.

50
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,360
I was wrong.

51
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,790
"This led to the three of us traveling to

52
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,440
the Hunter Exam site together.

53
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,500
But the journey wasn't so simple."

54
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,470
Exciting two-choice quiz!

55
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,020
Here is your question...

56
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,030
Your son and daughter have
been kidnapped.

57
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,800
You can only rescue one.

58
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Select 1 for your son,
or 2 for your daughter.

59
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,190
Which will you rescue?

60
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,240
She's making fun of us...

61
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,060
Don't stop me, Kurapika!

62
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,750
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!

63
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,230
Calm down, Leorio!

64
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,820
How am I supposed to calm down?

65
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,550
You'll waste our correct response!

66
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,310
Correct response?

67
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,940
We gave the right answer.

68
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,060
Silence was the correct response.

69
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,560
Please...

70
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,110
Please save my wife...

71
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
Leorio, we'll leave the
injured man to you!

72
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,080
Kurapika!

73
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,840
Who are you?

74
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,590
How can you tell that I'm
not the same one?

75
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,800
Huh?

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,850
Your face is completely different.

77
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,000
And your voice is a little
higher and thinner.

78
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
What?

79
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,610
Did I say something funny?

80
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,120
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation

81
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,870
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.

82
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,120
You pass.

83
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,130
"Finally, the Hunter Exam began!"

84
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,000
I apologize for the wait.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,150
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.

86
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,650
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,110
You must follow me to Phase Two.

88
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,420
This is the exam's First Phase.

89
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,850
"That's when I made friends

90
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,180
with a boy around my age,
named Killua."

91
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,280
Hey, how old are you?

92
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,180
I'm twelve years old.

93
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,650
Hmm...

94
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,180
We're the same age.

95
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
Huh?

96
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,060
Guess I'll run, too.

97
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,940
Wow!

98
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,280
That was cool!

99
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm Killua.

100
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm Gon.

101
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,450
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

102
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,170
Me?

103
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,210
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.

104
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,710
Huh?

105
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,870
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,

106
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,020
so I thought it'd be fun.

107
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,210
But this is disappointing.

108
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,680
What about you?

109
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,010
Well, my dad's a Hunter.

110
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,590
So I want to become a Hunter,
like my dad.

111
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,690
Hmm...

112
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,330
What kind of Hunter is he?

113
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't know.

114
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,290
That's kinda weird.

115
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,200
Really?

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,020
You want to be like your dad,

117
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,690
but you don't know anything about him?

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,360
I was raised by Mito-san,

119
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,800
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.

120
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
Who's Mito-san?

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,700
Aunt Mito.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,140
Oh...

123
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,830
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.

124
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,840
He passed and became a Hunter.

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,710
Then he left the island.

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,970
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter

127
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,720
over being with me.

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,210
The exit!

129
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,470
Whew...

130
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,190
Goal!

131
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Yay! I win!

132
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,530
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,910
I was faster...

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,940
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.

135
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,190
If you can take this ball from me,

136
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,460
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.

137
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,940
It's mine!

138
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,910
I commend you on your efforts.

139
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,790
"Thanks to Killua,

140
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,110
the Hunter Exam's been a lot of fun.

141
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,960
We're best friends now."

142
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:09,140
Hunter Vocabulary

143
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,140
Letter

144
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,900
"Applicants come from around the world
to take the Hunter Exam,

145
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,370
so there are lots of amazing people."

146
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,670
Not bad, little boy.

147
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,340
Is that a fishing pole?

148
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
What a fascinating weapon.

149
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,180
Allow me a closer look.

150
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,210
Your fight is with

151
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,270
me!

152
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,530
You came to rescue your friend?

153
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,740
Such a good boy.

154
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,370
And that expression...

155
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,120
Very nice.

156
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,420
I'm getting excited now...

157
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,100
How wonderful...

158
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,370
I really do love that look.

159
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,160
Do not fear.

160
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,540
I will not kill your friend.

161
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,050
He passed.

162
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,930
Yes, you pass, as well.

163
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,810
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.

164
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,320
But I was pretty excited, as well.

165
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,850
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

166
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,570
But I couldn't.

167
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,200
And at the same time, I was excited.

168
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,580
Isn't that strange?

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,060
"At the start of the Hunter Exam,
there were 404 applicants.

170
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,090
But by the time we reached
the Third Phase,

171
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,520
only 41 were left."

172
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,840
Ahem...

173
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,600
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,

174
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,200
at the top of Trick Tower.

175
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,850
Trick Tower?

176
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,600
To pass this phase,

177
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,150
you must reach the tower's base alive.

178
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,680
The time limit is seventy-two hours.

179
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,780
Wh-What is this place?

180
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,790
Look over there.

181
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,960
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.

182
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,220
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.

183
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,410
The Hunter Exam Committee

184
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,990
has also officially hired them
as examiners.

185
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,010
You will be fighting against
the five of them.

186
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,910
There's too much at stake
without knowing

187
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,750
what they have up their sleeves.

188
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Given that, I shall...

189
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,740
No, I'll go!

190
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,450
Tonpa-san?

191
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,370
Let the fight begin!

192
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,460
I...

193
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,960
I give!

194
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,850
Huh?

195
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,000
What?

196
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,830
Did he just give up?

197
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,340
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?

198
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,860
We each light a candle
at the same time.

199
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,030
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.

200
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,660
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!

201
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,830
The flame suddenly became stronger!

202
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,050
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,

203
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,300
to make the candle burn faster!

204
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,050
If the fire is stronger,

205
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,180
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.

206
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,730
He's fast!

207
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,230
I win!

208
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,750
A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...

209
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,040
That's...

210
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,390
I'm Majitani, one of the
Phantom Troupe's four kings!

211
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,050
Consider that first strike
my way of saying hello.

212
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,610
This is your last chance to surrender.

213
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,010
I'm still willing to...

214
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,470
Huh?

215
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,030
Wh-What's wrong with you?

216
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,950
Huh?

217
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,370
Wh-What?

218
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!

219
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,720
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!

220
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,390
What?

221
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,220
It's so obvious what you'll use.

222
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,980
I can read minds.

223
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,690
Liar!

224
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,300
Your bluffing won't scare me!

225
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,990
You'll believe me soon enough.

226
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,990
Let's do this!

227
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
Rock...

228
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Paper...

229
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,750
Scissors!

230
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,080
Well? What will you use next?

231
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,170
Think hard.

232
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:56,990
Come on.

233
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,290
Damn!

234
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,770
Man, I have no idea what to think!

235
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,020
Here we go!

236
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,020
Here...

237
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,770
comes the...

238
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,020
draw!

239
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,940
I win!

240
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,220
How are we settling this contest?

241
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,500
Contest?

242
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,450
I believe you're confused.

243
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,320
This will be a one-sided massacre.

244
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,960
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.

245
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,470
I just want to hear you scream.

246
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,620
Really? Okay.

247
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,510
Then the loser is the one who dies.

248
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,540
Yeah, that's right.

249
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,080
I'll tear your body apart.

250
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,150
That's...

251
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,390
mine.

252
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,500
G-Give it back.

253
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,700
Please select a path.

254
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,200
There are two choices.

255
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,150
One path allows five to pass,

256
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,840
but is long and difficult.

257
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,650
The other path allows only three,

258
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,740
but is short and easy.

259
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,170
I'm going to press O.

260
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,050
We made it all the way here together.

261
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,510
I want us all to pass together.

262
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,980
Gon...

263
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,250
Even if it's a big risk,

264
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,260
I want to give it a shot!

265
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,390
We entered the long and difficult path.

266
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,380
Then cut a hole in the wall,

267
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,280
to sneak into the short and easy path.

268
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,790
My butt hurts...

269
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,510
I didn't expect a slide

270
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,630
for the short and easy path.

271
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,640
Three of them...

272
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,180
Thirty seconds remain.

273
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,680
That was really close.

274
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,980
My hands are covered with blisters.

275
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,560
Same here.

276
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,310
Leorio, applicant #403,
is the twenty-third to pass.

277
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,820
My hands are blistered,

278
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,670
but all five of us cleared
the tower together.

279
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,510
All thanks to Gon!

280
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,790
The Third Phase of the exam is over.

281
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,110
Twenty-five applicants have passed.

282
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,580
One has died.

283
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,190
"And so,

284
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,590
I've completed the exam's
Third Phase, Mito-san.

285
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,790
I don't know how many are left,

286
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,800
but I'll pass them all

287
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,560
and become a Hunter, just like Dad.

288
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,610
Until next time,

289
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,870
Gon Freecss."

290
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,680
Ging, your son is following

291
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,650
in your footsteps.

292
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,250
Well?

293
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,550
Are you happy?

294
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,050
Next time: Hit x The x Target!

295
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,550
Be sneaky like Hisoka!

296
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,760
Hit and run.
