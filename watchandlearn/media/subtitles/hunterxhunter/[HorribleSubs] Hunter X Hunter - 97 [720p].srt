2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,620
They can't avenge them because

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,980
they're too busy arguing over
whether they're dead or mutated?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,150
Nothing's changed.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,950
They always lose sight of what's important.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,990
We're going to do things our way.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,120
If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,120
Don't worry.

9
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,000
Carnage x And x Devastation

10
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,940
The Chimera Ant Zazan has
built her nest in Meteor City.

11
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,890
Calling herself the Queen,
she seeks to conquer the world.

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,150
The ones who have risen to quell her
ambitions are inhabitants of this city...

13
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,440
The Phantom Troupe.

14
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,870
Where's everyone else?

15
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,160
Beats me...
Maybe still playing around?

16
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,030
Rather than obliterating my opponent,
I should have enjoyed myself...

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,930
That took longer than expected...

18
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,730
I should break my habit

19
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,760
of beating my targets to a pulp.

20
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,170
You're no match for me!

21
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,090
Come back when you're stronger.

22
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,240
Fair point.

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,640
My, you took that well.

24
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,900
Looks like I've lost my touch.

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,110
But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.

26
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,920
I'm stuck on defense...

27
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,450
He's fast, and has twice as many limbs.

28
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,050
I need to create an opening.

29
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,770
Again?

30
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,450
Now I'm certain...

31
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,640
The moment I think I'm rid of it,

32
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,080
she pulls that vacuum cleaner
out of nowhere again.

33
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,600
Her power lets her pull out
and store objects at will?

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,390
I see... Very interesting...

35
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,160
And I can't catch her with my sticky webs.

36
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
This girl is good,

37
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,080
but I can't let her get away.

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,610
This technique is a literal pain in the ass.

39
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,590
But I have no choice!

40
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,270
Love Shower!

41
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,350
Radiating Love

42
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,230
Uh-oh, there may be no way out of this one...

43
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,530
If I keep the webs coming, you can't escape...

44
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,240
Lucky me!

45
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,490
Caught you!

46
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,640
It's no use...

47
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,000
Even Bihorn-sama, strongest among us,
couldn't snap these webs.

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,010
Now, then...

49
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,500
I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.

50
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,920
Will Zazan-sama praise me?

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
It got lighter?

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,770
Impossible—

53
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,650
How?!

54
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,650
How did she escape?

55
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,530
Huh?

56
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,540
I get it...

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,690
You ditched your clothes.

58
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,540
I understand.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,790
She widened an opening in my web to
slip through, while protecting her skin.

60
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,300
With her power, it's feasible.

61
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,560
She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...

62
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,850
But after escaping, she can make it
disappear and call it to her again.

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,240
However!

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,750
Now that you've removed your clothes,
you can't use the same trick again!

65
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,970
The same applies to you.

66
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,200
I've learned the range and speed of your webs.

67
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,450
And I won't mention that his anus
twitches twice before he fires.

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,460
You won't catch me again.
I'll keep my distance.

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,210
Blinky and I have won.

70
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,450
Won?

71
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,340
Such a stupid girl...

72
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,120
You can't do anything while running away.

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,130
I said that I'll keep my distance,

74
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,720
but I didn't say anything about running.

75
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,190
I'll show you the difference.

76
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,620
Blinky...

77
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,480
Suck every last drop of blood from his body.

78
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,240
What... Wh-Wh-What?

79
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,740
Stop it!

80
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,700
H-Hey...

81
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,750
Y-You little...

82
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,850
Weakling!

83
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,870
Uh-oh, this is bad...

84
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,870
I'm getting dizzy.

85
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,100
I have to stop the blood loss!

86
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,400
(How's that?)

87
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,150
(Now you can't suck my blood...)

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,430
There's more?

89
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,590
From here?

90
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,040
And here?

91
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,380
I... I can't block everywhere!

92
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,430
You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.

93
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,400
Based on currently available information,

94
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,050
it's impossible for you to cover
each wound with your eight limbs...

95
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,200
Not without another ace in the hole.

96
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,690
All cleaned up.

97
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,170
Huh?

98
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,880
Hmm...

99
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,910
Ah, you know those webs
you were shooting out?

100
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,380
By covering your body with them,
couldn't you have stopped the bleeding?

101
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
We're both pretty stupid...

102
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,000
What is this?

103
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,080
How can they move so fast?

104
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Looks like he's moving a little better now.

105
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,760
He has a ways to go before
he's back to full strength.

106
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,710
They were already here, enjoying the show.

107
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,520
I wasted some time fooling around,
but I was by no means slow...

108
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,840
Five?

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,280
No, seven?

110
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,530
How many feints was that?

111
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,180
And how can he leap from
that position while attacki—

112
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,580
Ah! He's already over there!

113
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,050
I can't believe it...

114
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,020
He's on a completely
different level.

115
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,580
Whoa, everyone's already here?

116
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,010
Going for a new look?

117
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,820
I got caught in my opponent's webs.

118
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,590
Wait, you actually lost—

119
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,520
I won.

120
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,430
She's really mad!

121
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,200
Feitan's the only one left.

122
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,550
His opponent's pretty strong.

123
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,710
It's probably the Queen.

124
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
But Feitan looks sluggish.

125
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,620
He isn't back to full strength yet...

126
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,710
We know! You already said that!

127
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm still too weak.

128
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,440
Behind me?

129
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,110
What's with this guy?

130
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,110
He keeps getting faster?

131
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,290
And more of his buddies keep showing up.

132
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,050
Curse those worthless idiots!

133
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,540
All of them were defeated?!

134
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,150
I didn't think your skin would be so tough.

135
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,150
Cur...

136
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,280
Curse you!

137
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,430
How dare you damage my face?!

138
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,470
I'll kill you!

139
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,110
Ko!

140
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,390
She left herself wide open.

141
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,700
I'm not nice enough to overlook that.

142
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,890
Her attack didn't hit him...

143
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,010
No, she sent a little aura with that swing.

144
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,850
Feitan's idea to use Ko backfired.

145
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,660
After focusing his aura into one point,
he didn't expect to deal no damage.

146
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,350
The miscalculation left him a second
late guarding with his Nen.

147
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,910
In other words, he was basically defenseless.

148
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,960
A puny Emitter attack could
have dealt serious damage.

149
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,020
She knows how to use her aura.

150
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,370
She has good reason to call herself Queen.

151
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,370
This body has no weaknesses!

152
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,120
Shouldn't we help him?

153
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,120
Huh? Why?

154
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
This is a race...

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,680
If he loses, the next person gets to try.

156
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,040
Who's up next?

157
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,280
We use order of arrival.

158
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,850
That's me, then.

159
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,040
Wait...

160
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,260
We both arrived at the same time.

161
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,170
Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.

162
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,940
Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.

163
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,940
S-Something's...

164
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,030
wrong with them!

165
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,340
Heads.

166
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,620
Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.

167
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,780
Bah.

168
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,780
I was naïve...

169
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,790
I thought I could become
number two in no time.

170
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,450
But I'm utterly outclassed...

171
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,070
It's hopeless.

172
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,180
But I won't give up.

173
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm used to toughing it out.

174
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,550
All for the sake of retrieving my brother,
no matter how long it takes.

175
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,150
There goes his left arm.

176
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,240
Fei, wanna trade places?

177
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,160
"Piece of crap..."

178
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,660
"Know your place."

179
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,540
Crap, run for it...

180
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,920
You're gonna get caught in it.

181
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,090
When he snaps, he'll hit
everything around him!

182
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,670
We tried to watch him once
before and almost died.

183
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,240
His power has a huge range,

184
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,400
and activates with his anger,
so it knows no restraint.

185
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,160
If you get caught up in the
one he's using this time,

186
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,680
you're dead, Kalluto.

187
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,840
This time?

188
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,000
The attack has other forms?

189
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,000
Darn, I want to see!

190
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,400
What?

191
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
When did he put that on?!

192
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,730
Wait... More importantly,
he's much stronger now!

193
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,980
"Now I return your pain."

194
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,030
Feel the heat...

195
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,490
Pain Packer
Unforgiven

196
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Pain Packer!

197
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,050
Rising Sun.

198
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,760
Burnt by the Sun

199
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,810
"Is it hot?"

200
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,560
"Throat too scorched to even breathe?"

201
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,550
"You could try to run."

202
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,820
"Assuming you can even move..."

203
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,930
"What's wrong?"

204
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,560
"Make use of that tough body you're so proud of."

205
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,060
Impossible...

206
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,070
I am the Queen...

207
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,250
I cannot die here...

208
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,470
Out of fuel already?

209
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,630
And the heat wasn't that strong...

210
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
How unfortunate...

211
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,900
You could have had a quicker death
if you'd dealt me more damage.

212
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,010
Well, you only have yourself to blame.

213
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,170
They didn't revert after the Queen's death...

214
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,840
But they're no longer under the Queen's control.

215
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,910
Ple... ...me...

216
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,700
Please... ki...

217
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,710
Please... kill... me...

218
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,170
Please...

219
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,640
Kill us...

220
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,950
Hell, no.

221
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,650
I don't do mercy killings.

222
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,150
Attack me, trash!

223
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,080
You were living in this place, right?!

224
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,080
Have the guts to defend it to the end!

225
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,650
You can die with a bang!

226
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
Now those geezers

227
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,230
are arguing over whether to exact
revenge upon the real queen.

228
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,830
Man, I'm sick of those idiots.

229
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,990
All they do is sit around a table,
squawking about doing the impossible.

230
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,610
But you're still sticking around, right?

231
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,250
There's nothing else for me to do.

232
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,620
If more Ants show up,
I'll wipe them out at once.

233
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,000
So I don't have to do any more cleanup.

234
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
Is it the boss?!

235
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,960
No, it's Nobunaga.

236
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,970
He's asking if we'll help with his job.

237
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,530
What was that?

238
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,020
No way, fool!

239
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,890
Man, this sucks.

240
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,650
I hate having to wait.

241
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,400
Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush.

242
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,910
He's being very feminine.

243
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,620
Eh?

244
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,270
What was that, bastards?!

245
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,620
Say that again...

246
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,660
I'll kill you!

247
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,600
Hey! We're hurt!

248
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:24,040
The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor
City from the Chimera Ant invasion.

249
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,090
Meanwhile...

250
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,820
Gon and Killua are preparing to
infiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.

251
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:51,200
The selection of citizens to present
to the King by his own guards...

252
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,590
...will begin in nine days.

253
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,590
Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.

254
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,270
Meleoron the Chameleon.
Meleoron the Chameleon.

255
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,370
Meleoron the Chaleleron!

256
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,510
Meleoron the Chameleon...

257
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,240
Meleoron the Chameleon!
