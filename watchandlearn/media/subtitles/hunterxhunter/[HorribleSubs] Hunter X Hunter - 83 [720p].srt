00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,100
Been a while since I flipped my switch on.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,690
Scissors!

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,000
Well?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,730
Look at this!

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,260
I feel reborn!

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,010
Inspiration x To x Evolve

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,290
The Hunters Association

9
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,150
has learned of the Chimera Ants
from the biological survey team,

10
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,990
and now awaits the world leaders'
decision on how to handle them.

11
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,200
We're counting on you.

12
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,090
You have a single mission.

13
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,080
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.

14
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,050
There have already been many casualties.

15
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,440
We will use any means necessary.

16
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,590
Will that be acceptable?

17
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,170
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.

18
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,140
We simply desire

19
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,940
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.

20
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,810
Understood.

21
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,570
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association

22
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,780
to take the blame.

23
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,580
Th-The Chimera Ants

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,590
have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.

25
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,390
Queen

26
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,320
There's the Queen.

27
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,140
Royal Guard

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,160
Under her is the Royal Guard,

29
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,100
Squadron Leaders

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,100
and then, the Squadron Leaders.

31
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,100
Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,860
and they oversee many foot
soldiers and other grunts.

33
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,870
A-And once the King is born,
the hierarchy shifts like so.

34
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,350
The Royal Guard that followed the Queen

35
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,120
switches into the King's service.

36
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,030
A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders
report directly to the Queen,

37
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,260
and she focuses on directing the soldiers.

38
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,310
The Queen remains in the castle,
periodically giving birth to Kings.

39
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,770
The Kings travel and mate
with different organisms,

40
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,400
so as to breed new Queens.

41
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,270
That explains their fast reproduction rate.

42
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,280
To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,790
you must defeat the Queen before
she can give birth to a King.

44
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,420
But first, you need to defeat
all the soldiers guarding her.

45
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,310
That's a tall order.

46
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,690
Got it. We'll be waiting.

47
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
The punitive force's first wave is on its way.

48
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,550
Punitive force?

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,820
I wonder who they'll send.

50
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,200
They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.

51
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
They'll be strong.

52
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,500
They'd better be!

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,330
I'm worried about Kite and the kids.

54
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,410
They'll arrive in three days.

55
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,850
How?

56
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,090
Look at this!

57
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,350
Isn't it incredible?

58
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,350
Why does Rammot have so much life energy?

59
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,020
There must have been some catalyst.

60
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,110
A catalyst...

61
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,200
Rock...

62
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,700
Paper...

63
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,410
Rock!

64
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,900
That hurts...

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,250
Damn...

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,630
What if their attacks were the catalyst?

67
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,390
I can feel the power filling me!

68
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,590
Peggy...

69
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,020
I told you that we are capable
of anything that humans are.

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,870
Including the use of this strange power?

71
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,830
But this is...

72
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,660
Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.

73
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,910
Wh-What are you saying?

74
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,920
You've been ticking me off,
so I won't go easy on you.

75
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,670
I'm assuming that's what it takes.

76
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,440
Then I won't hold back.

77
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,700
Come.

78
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,240
Colt!

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,930
This is a message from Hagya.

80
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,110
This is a message from Hagya.

81
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,760
The ultimate prey is either
within the factory or nearby.

82
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,460
Capture it.

83
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,350
Capture it...

84
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,270
Dead or alive.

85
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,080
Capture it!

86
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,460
Hagya-sama...

87
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,420
What is it?

88
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Do you believe they will succeed?

89
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,990
There are enough Captains for a decent fight.

90
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,290
For a decent fight, huh?

91
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,930
But I doubt they'll be much help.

92
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,300
I'm fine with that.

93
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,800
Why is that?

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,550
They're just buying time for us to arrive.

95
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,680
Oh, I see.

96
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,690
Then the rare humans will be ours to take.

97
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,710
Exactly.

98
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,850
We're surrounded.

99
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,100
Their numbers are great.

100
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,010
Now, then...

101
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,710
Let's decide order and methodology.

102
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,140
As for our targets, you have three choices.

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,350
One...

104
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,100
Decide the order in which you will fight.

105
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Two, attempt to escape.

106
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,400
Three, give up and let us capture you.

107
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,570
If you choose option one,

108
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,390
you will fight one-on-one battles with us

109
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,910
for a chance to survive.

110
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,650
I don't recommend the second option.

111
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,920
You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture

112
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,090
and prolonged suffering for all of you.

113
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,260
Option three is out of the question.

114
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,680
That would anger us even more than option two.

115
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,740
So, what will you do?

116
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,550
Kite...

117
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,940
We couldn't have asked for a better deal.

118
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,270
One-on-one fights with their Captains.

119
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,490
We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.

120
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,650
I'll go.

121
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,240
No, I will.

122
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,280
First comes rock!

123
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,500
Rock, paper, scissors!

124
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,270
Okay, I'm first!

125
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,850
While the Ants have inherited
individualism from humans,

126
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,280
they've lost the unity that's
characteristic of ants.

127
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,930
I hope we'll be able

128
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,390
to take advantage of that change.

129
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,370
Well, we need to decide who
to send from our side.

130
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,540
#6...

131
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,570
#6!

132
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,790
Who's #6?

133
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,800
Lucky me!

134
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,050
Baro?

135
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,420
How will the victor be decided?

136
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,810
Eh? That should be obvious.

137
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,060
Whoever dies first loses.

138
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,610
We can't just surrender?

139
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,800
What?!

140
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,940
Are you crazy?

141
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,110
If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.

142
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,700
If you don't defeat me,
you're guaranteed to die!

143
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,330
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

144
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,750
But there's no need for you to die.

145
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,660
If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.

146
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,010
If you surrender, you'll live.

147
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,340
But if you lose,

148
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,350
you must promise never to eat another human.

149
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,030
This guy isn't taking us seriously!

150
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,410
He has more pep than any human I've seen!

151
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,360
Lucky you, Baro-chan!

152
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,470
I'll kill you!

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,450
You managed to dodge that one.

154
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,880
Then how about this?

155
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,710
The same attack?

156
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,770
Gon!

157
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,120
He altered course.

158
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,520
I'm fine.

159
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,170
Why are you so tough?

160
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,530
By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.

161
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,190
Whatever...

162
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,230
Just need a few more times.

163
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,540
There's no way to dodge my homing roll!

164
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,890
Indeed...

165
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,420
He only has to alter his course to
match the direction Gon dodges.

166
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,910
What will you do, Gon?

167
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,610
Kid, I have something to
tell you before I kill you.

168
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,040
The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them

169
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,560
or to feed them to the Queen.

170
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,350
Then why?

171
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,940
Because it's fun!

172
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,950
I love the sound as humans
vomit their own organs

173
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,630
with a plop!

174
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,960
It's hilarious because it looks like barf.

175
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,010
That isn't funny.

176
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,460
I'll make you vomit your own
organs with a plop, too!

177
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,230
He didn't dodge...

178
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,330
But stopped him.

179
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,740
Compared to Razor's spikes,

180
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,160
this is nothing!

181
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,650
Well, we're in a hurry.

182
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,780
Who's my opponent?

183
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,940
Hey!

184
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,840
#3.

185
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,970
#3's up!

186
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,540
You won't be smiling for long.

187
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,290
I'm about to show you hell.

188
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,120
Got it?

189
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,430
I'm nothing like the trash over there.

190
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,440
Trash?

191
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,930
Huh? I said trash because he's trash.

192
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm ten times stronger than that guy.

193
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,060
Oh, that's nothing to brag about.

194
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,360
What was that?!

195
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,320
When they enter battle,
their aura becomes much stronger.

196
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,420
They're at their best in battle.

197
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,080
Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,

198
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,570
but we should have time.

199
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,420
We'll reach the Queen before
she gives birth to the King.

200
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,300
But why

201
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,380
do I have such a bad feeling?

202
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,220
I feel like I'm missing something.

203
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,710
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.

204
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,240
Look, Peggy!

205
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,250
I can freely control this energy!

206
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,420
This is incredible!

207
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,000
We should do more research.

208
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,380
Eh?

209
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,810
If we learn the proper way
to wield this power,

210
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,450
we can synchronize it with our natural abilities

211
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,890
to make it an even stronger weapon.

212
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,080
You're too retentive...

213
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,440
Zazan...

214
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,650
She said she captured a rare
human a few days ago...

215
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,910
If we're lucky,

216
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,510
he's still in the storeroom.

217
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,110
Find and secure him.

218
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,190
My entire body is covered by hardened skin.

219
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,240
I can take as many of those
attacks as you can throw!

220
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,530
Oh, yeah?

221
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,970
Is there anyone ten times
stronger than this guy?

222
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,570
This is a pleasant surprise.

223
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,770
Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.

224
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,910
Am I worried over nothing?

225
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,730
That's enough... It's my turn!

226
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,550
2!

227
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,450
What?

228
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,470
Two, huh?

229
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,300
Damn, bad spin.

230
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,530
Killua...

231
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,740
That scythe is nasty.

232
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,310
Gon, Killua...

233
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,190
In three seconds, jump up.

234
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,950
Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?

235
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,650
Right!

236
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,960
I've experienced this sensation before!

237
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,010
Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance

238
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,490
I remember now.

239
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,930
This is

240
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,310
death!

241
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,410
Murder via overwhelming force.

242
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,640
Get lost.

243
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,030
This scythe can be used
only with this technique.

244
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,350
And it won't disappear until I've used it.

245
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,200
It's such a drag...

246
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,780
So why did you choose that power?

247
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,210
Be cautious as we advance.

248
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,540
As I mentioned, that won't be
enough to kill them immediately.

249
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,290
Are you okay?

250
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,450
It's only getting worse from here.

251
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,300
If you start to sympathize with the enemy,
you won't be able to handle what's coming.

252
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,430
I'm fine.

253
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,060
I have no sympathy for bugs
that call each other trash.

254
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,360
That's a dangerous view.

255
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,000
What would you do if one of those
bugs cared for its comrades?

256
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,670
Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward
the Chimera Ant Queen's castle

257
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,840
to prevent the King's birth.

258
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,650
Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.

259
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,250
I'll go.

260
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,170
No, I will!

261
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,070
No, me!

262
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,400
Then I'll go.

263
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,260
Go right ahead.
