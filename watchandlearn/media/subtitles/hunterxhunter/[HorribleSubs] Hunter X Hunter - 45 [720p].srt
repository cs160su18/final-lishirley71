00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,840
Chain Jail.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,090
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,130
This power can only be used on the spiders...

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,880
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,960
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,250
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,560
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,220
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,020
The proof of my resolve.

11
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,020
Restraint x And x Vow

12
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
After using Chain Jail

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,590
to capture Uvogin, Kurapika

14
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,030
and his fellow bodyguards flee by car.

15
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,930
We have cars behind us.

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,290
Someone check it out.

17
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,340
Indeed...

18
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,540
Think it's them?

19
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,370
Kurapika, floor it!

20
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,050
It's a tail!

21
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,330
A tail?

22
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,310
But who?

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Could it be?

24
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,630
A thread!

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,080
Probably made of Nen.

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,940
There's something on his left thigh.

27
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,190
Damn!

28
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,260
They noticed it.

29
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,440
That was faster than expected.

30
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,050
Don't worry.
We've almost got them!

31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,320
Whatever...

32
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,040
Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?

33
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,830
It's just a little longer.

34
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,750
Fun Fun Cloth:
Convenient Magic Kerchief

35
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,520
What the hell?

36
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,390
Hey!

37
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,070
Let me out, damn it!

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,200
You guys really are good.

39
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,860
Given that you were

40
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,550
fast enough to open the door
and escape in moments.

41
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,790
I'll need to take care.

42
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,170
Nobunaga had an unlucky position...

43
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,300
Anyway, you have an interesting ability.

44
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Let me out, damn it!

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,730
You can shrink anything merely
by using that cloth?

46
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,060
That would be quite handy for theft.

47
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,060
With that thing, you could fit all
of the treasure in your pocket.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,370
Meaning that he's the one
who took the treasure

49
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,060
from the auction house.

50
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,520
And so, you can also restore
everything to its original size.

51
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,570
I believe the boss said he's named Owl.

52
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,830
His friends have arrived to help.

53
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,990
Yes...

54
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,220
There are quite a few of them.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,730
Who are these guys?

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,730
Are they really Phantom Troupe members?

57
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,980
Yeah, definitely.

58
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,240
But they look so weak.

59
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,170
One, two, three...

60
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,390
Huh?

61
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,160
What's wrong?

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,700
There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,000
Uvo took care of four,

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,030
so this should be the rest.

65
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,470
That is strange.

66
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,500
The chain user grabbed Uvo,
before escaping by car.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,440
Does that mean the chain
user isn't a Shadow Beast?

68
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,660
Well, we'll know once we ask them...

69
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,230
Should we keep them all alive?

70
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,020
No, we require only Owl.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
Then I'll handle that.

72
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,380
Those damned kids are talking smack.

73
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,030
Let's show them how scary the
Shadow Beasts can be.

74
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,870
Did you hear that?

75
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,160
Shalnark, you just stand
there and watch.

76
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,720
I'll take three.

77
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
Shizuku can have the other two.

78
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,410
Got it.

79
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,160
Don't get cocky!

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Keep your cool!

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
Don't underestimate their strength!

82
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,170
Shut up!

83
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,010
We lost them.

84
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,410
But what was it that I just saw

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,430
landing on the roof of their car?

86
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,050
Probably one of the
remaining Shadow Beasts.

87
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,060
This is our chance to
hurry back to the city.

88
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,360
Roger that.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,010
We'll switch the location to pattern C.

90
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,630
And we don't want Muscles
here putting up a fight,

91
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,820
so we'll need muscle relaxants
and sleeping gas.

92
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,640
I hope those will work...

93
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,080
Move, and you'll get cut.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,020
Okay, all done.

95
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,090
What about the bodies?

96
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,860
Just leave them.

97
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,840
No point hiding them now.

98
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,190
Okay, let's free Nobunaga

99
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,970
before we start torturing this guy.

100
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,350
Hold on.

101
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,740
We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?

102
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,640
There's no room, so let's
leave Nobunaga as he is.

103
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,860
Screw that! Let me out!

104
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,360
I don't want to be cramped, either.

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,610
Come on!

106
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,190
Hey, can you release the car alone?

107
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,660
I know you can hear me!

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,100
You're really making me mad!

109
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,700
Th-That's impossible...

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,300
Let me out, already!

111
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,110
Too bad.

112
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,900
So much for that...

113
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,750
Hey! What's going on?

114
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,380
You bastards were

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,810
making a fool out of me!

116
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,900
Troupe members aren't
supposed to snap at one other.

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,880
Shut up!

118
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,560
Anyway, this ability could come
in handy for our job.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,670
Shut your mouth!

120
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm cutting this guy to shreds!

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,870
No.

122
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,610
He's going to tell us
where the treasure is...

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,110
Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.

124
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,860
You just have bad luck.

125
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,620
Damn it!

126
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,520
Hey, wake up!

127
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,400
You understand

128
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,760
what's happening here?

129
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,650
Where did you put the
stolen merchandise?

130
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,410
What time is it?

131
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,910
How long have I been asleep?

132
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,790
It seems that you don't grasp
your current situation.

133
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,050
I'm asking the questions here!

134
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,290
Incredible mental fortitude...

135
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,120
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,980
but the aura around his
body remains firm.

137
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,330
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.

138
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,080
That is why his aura is so strong.

139
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,210
The product of countless battles.

140
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm asking the questions here!

141
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,000
Incredible mental fortitude...

142
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,880
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,

143
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,640
but the aura around his
body remains firm.

144
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,160
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.

145
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,910
That is why his aura is so strong.

146
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,000
The product of countless battles.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,270
Can I move?

148
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,670
No...

149
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,520
I won't recover for a while.

150
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,280
I had dinner around 8.

151
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,320
Judging by my stomach,
it's around midnight now.

152
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,940
Let's make a deal.

153
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,690
I'll spare your lives, so let me up now.

154
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,940
Wh-What is he saying?

155
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,340
Is he insane?!

156
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,540
He's serious.

157
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,300
I think.

158
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,950
What? Are you crazy?

159
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,230
He's the one who should
be begging for his life.

160
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,960
Let me make something clear.

161
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,970
We're after the auction merchandise
that was stored underground.

162
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,960
If you guys don't know where it is,

163
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
I have no business with you.

164
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,520
What?

165
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,980
Wait a moment.

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,800
You didn't steal the merchandise?

167
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,230
The safe was empty when we arrived.

168
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,590
The Shadow Beasts had
already taken it all.

169
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,240
I guess they didn't bother
telling grunts like you.

170
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,390
I don't think he's lying...

171
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,350
Then he's serious?

172
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,000
When he offered to make a
deal, he wasn't bluffing?

173
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,880
Everyone makes mistakes...

174
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,380
We haven't stolen anything yet.

175
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,120
So take these off,

176
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,030
and pretend you didn't see anything.

177
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,270
If you do that,

178
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,520
you get to live!

179
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,370
What about the guests?

180
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,280
Guests?

181
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,660
The guests who were in the auction hall.

182
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,540
Some of our colleagues were there.

183
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,180
Answer me.

184
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,090
I see.

185
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,040
That's too bad...

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,260
We killed them.

187
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,550
It was part of our plan—

188
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,390
How many lives do you think you took

189
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,430
to carry out that plan of yours?!

190
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,380
Stop, Kurapika!

191
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,310
Stop it!

192
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,500
If the merchandise is in safe hands,

193
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,400
we don't need him.

194
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,560
We'll hand him over to the community.

195
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,820
So, no deal?

196
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh, did you find out what
became of the merchandise?

197
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,220
Shut up! Ask Feitan!

198
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,490
Did he tell you where the merchandise is?

199
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,830
It was no fun...

200
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,490
I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in.

201
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,840
Oh, so that's it.

202
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,760
Ah, I just remembered.

203
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,170
I was supposed to meet someone today.

204
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,990
I'll be heading out.

205
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,180
Sure, go ahead.

206
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,180
As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.

207
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,150
Up to some mischief, Hisoka?

208
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,550
But of course.

209
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,040
Damn...

210
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,190
"Let us meet at the agreed upon place."

211
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,720
Where's Shalnark?

212
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,170
He just called.

213
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,720
He's succeeded in locating
a Mafia comms room.

214
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,730
This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.

215
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,220
We've captured one of the bandits
who attacked the auction

216
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,760
and wish to hand him over.

217
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,910
Really?

218
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,460
How did you manage that?

219
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,490
I can provide further details later.

220
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,570
That's impressive...

221
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,500
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.

222
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,790
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?

223
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,490
Yeah, they were completely wiped out.

224
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,530
Wiped out...

225
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,250
Well, where are you right now?

226
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,750
Okay, got it.

227
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,040
Move quickly.

228
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, we'll bring our best people.

229
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,340
I gave him three canisters
of muscle relaxants.

230
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,450
Understood.

231
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,610
The Mafia will be here soon.

232
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,190
I'll watch him until then,
so get some rest, everyone.

233
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,330
Yeah.

234
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,800
You move fast.

235
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,280
He isn't using In.

236
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,670
No need for concern.

237
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,420
I have no interest in fighting you now...

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,550
I'm not here for idle chat!

239
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,160
Tell me about your organization.

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
Really?

241
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,050
I love idle chat.

242
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,550
There are thirteen spiders,

243
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,940
identifiable by their
numbered spider tattoos.

244
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,940
Members can change at
a moment's notice.

245
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,230
An applicant defeating a standing
member replaces them.

246
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,220
If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,

247
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,910
the boss selects the replacement.

248
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,100
The Troupe focuses primarily
on stealing and killing.

249
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,560
Sometimes, they perform
philanthropic work.

250
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,230
I already know all of that.

251
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,980
Two or three years ago,

252
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,030
I replaced the man who was #4.

253
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,130
For what purpose?

254
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,490
So that I could fight the boss.

255
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,940
The boss?

256
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,520
Why would you want that?

257
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,280
Because he is strong...

258
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,690
You wished to test your strength?

259
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,590
Perhaps.

260
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,070
But...

261
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,170
It turns me on...

262
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,700
Thinking about fighting the boss...

263
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,490
But I've never had the chance.

264
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,580
He never lowers his guard.

265
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,710
At a minimum, two others
always accompany him.

266
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,870
And when a job ends, he vanishes.

267
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,240
Without a trace.

268
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,850
So I reached a conclusion
that benefits us both.

269
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,860
Would you not agree that reaching
our goals alone will be difficult?

270
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,110
What are you trying to say?

271
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,480
I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.

272
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
There are seven whose
powers I already know.

273
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,500
Interested...

274
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,710
in teaming up?

275
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,510
Yeah, we're on floor B2.

276
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,220
Thanks.

277
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,770
You haven't killed him yet?

278
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,490
No.

279
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,280
This way.

280
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,760
We couldn't get a needle into him,

281
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,530
so we used paralytic gas.

282
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,540
You clean up nicely.

283
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,270
Huh?

284
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,080
I couldn't believe my ears

285
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,760
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.

286
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,020
Blinky, time for work.

287
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,900
Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.

288
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,910
Okay, all done.

289
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,770
Damn!

290
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,060
I'm gonna make that chain user pay...

291
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,480
Wake up, everyone!

292
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,530
Where is he?!

293
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,630
He ran away.

294
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,910
You were too loud.

295
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,430
We're heading back.

296
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,990
Our job here is done.

297
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,920
We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.

298
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
And we got our treasure.

299
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,980
No!

300
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,300
Tell the boss...

301
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,100
I won't go back until I settle up

302
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,000
with that chain user.

303
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,820
Uvogin has been freed.

304
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,950
Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up,

305
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,620
is not yet aware of this.

306
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

307
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

308
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

309
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

310
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

311
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

312
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

313
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

314
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:19,580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

315
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Today, we introduce Dalzollene.

316
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,030
Leads Neon's bodyguards.

317
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,200
He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!

318
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:19,580
A cruel, impatient man who disposes
of any who fail to follow orders.

319
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,910
Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!

320
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,060
It's a drag for me, taking care of you.

321
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,920
What are you on about?!

322
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,920
Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.

323
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
Hey, Killua,

324
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,470
let's play Drop the Handkerchief.

325
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,660
I'll drop it, and you sit and wait.

326
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,250
You can't play that with two people!
