Homecoming x And x True Name

3
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,920
With the death of King Meruem,

4
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,990
the battle between Chimera Ants
and humans was over.

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:49,240

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:49,240
Republic of Rokario
NGL Autonomous Region

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,220
The Republic of East Gorteau and
the NGL were tentatively placed

9
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,030
under control of international peacekeepers,

10
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,350
and the nations essentially ceased to exist.

11
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,050
Between the two former nations,

12
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,600
five million survivors were declared refugees.

13
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,710
The Mitene Union's three remaining members

14
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,740
divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed

15
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,830
to jointly govern the former nation's territory.

16
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,950
As for the NGL,

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,960
there was a proposal to give all open land

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,670
permanent designation as nature reserves,
to prevent future incidents.

19
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,780
And the international community concurred.

20
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,730
It was agreed that the nature reserves would be

21
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,160
under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.

22
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,680
Are you sure about this?

23
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,930
Yeah, I'm gonna live here.

24
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,940
The name "Gyro" doesn't mean anything to me.

25
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,760
But this place feels very familiar.

26
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,530
I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident
that didn't work for Gyro...

27
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,460
Well, I won't force you to come, then.

28
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,490
This is probably safer than other countries now.

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,270
Exactly.

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,710
One look at me, and the peacekeepers
would freeze on the spot.

31
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,050
Is that

32
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,760
why she's staying?

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,580
No, in her case...

34
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,610
She seems more like you guys.

35
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,100
What do you mean?

36
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey! Aren't you done?

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,840
We'll leave you behind!

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,480
Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!

39
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,880
Well, people like me who barely
remember our previous lives

40
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,380
can tell that people like you and Hina,
who have their memories, are different.

41
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,260
There's something in your eyes.

42
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,010
Or it's how you look into the distance.

43
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,640
Somehow, I can tell at once.

44
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,250
"This guy remembers his past."

45
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,020
And I can tell that

46
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,040
she remembers her past.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,300
Hina said she'll never talk to us...

48
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,140
But I don't think it's that she won't talk.

49
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,720
It's that she can't talk.

50
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,880
She's probably just a kid.

51
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,050
Welfin!

52
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,020
Zip it! I get the idea!

53
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,800
See ya.

54
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,270
We probably won't see each
other again, so take care.

55
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,340
Yeah.

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,360
Try not to die until you're dead.

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,820
The hell is that?

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,980
Gyro's way of saying goodbye.

59
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,200
It's one of my favorite phrases.

60
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,370
Did you just remember something?

61
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,600
No... I just kinda like the phrase.

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,790
Oh.

63
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,260
So life is what you make of it, huh?

64
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,080
Later.

65
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,480
Yeah.

66
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,490
Well, let's get going.

67
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,620
Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!

68
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,510
Seriously, you have no shame.

69
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,770
Not so long ago, it was
"Hagya-sama" this, "Leol-sama" that.

70
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,770
Who's that?

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,030
Huh?

72
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,520
No point in thinking about the dead.

73
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,360
I have to move forward!

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,330
Straight ahead!

75
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,110
Still... Are you sure we can
make it through the port?

76
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,180
Yeah, this is a government vehicle,

77
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,790
so once I show my card, they'll let us pass.

78
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,760
Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City...

79
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,020
How far I've fallen.

80
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,870
Don't be so negative about it.

81
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,970
Just be patient.

82
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,410
I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.

83
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,190
It's possible that

84
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,500
he's already gathered all the sympathizers

85
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,440
and tools we'll need to build our own nation.

86
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,080
Which means...

87
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,330
In no time, we'll be back on top!

88
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,580
Yay!

89
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,770
You're so optimistic, I can only envy you.

90
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,870
Optimistic?

91
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,820
You've got that right.

92
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,940
I've already died twice...

93
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,220
But I'm still alive!

94
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,760
Nothing scares me now.

95
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,230
I'm ready for anything!

96
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,400
Plus,

97
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,610
I'm the one who stopped the King.

98
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
H-Hey...

99
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal.

100
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,000
Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.

101
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,850
Yeah, that's the spirit.

102
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,870
Humans are alive until they're dead!

103
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,030
What? You're stating the obvious!

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,250
Quiet!

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,940
Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to
Meteor City, in search of Gyro.

106
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,190
Is that the village?

107
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,240
Hey...

108
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,670
Don't worry.

109
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm with you.

110
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,540
Monsters!

111
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, that's to be expected.

112
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,530
Hey!

113
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,950
People of NGL!

114
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,180
I need someone who can communicate

115
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,580
in a peaceful and reasonable manner!

116
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,700
I'm not here to harm anyone!

117
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,700
I just have a question to ask!

118
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,710
Hey! You can speak?

119
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,710
Who are you?

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,470
Uh...

121
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,720
This will probably be hard to believe,
but will you hear me out?

122
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,110
You're the only people I can turn to!

123
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,750
Reina?

124
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,430
How did...

125
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,760
you know?

126
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,330
Reina...

127
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,750
Reina...

128
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,620
Reina!

129
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,750
How did you know?

130
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,060
Of course I knew...

131
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,830
I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!

132
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,610
Welcome home.

133
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,690
I'm so glad you're back.

134
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,150
Brother tried to protect me!

135
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,660
He told the monster to go away,

136
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,520
and told me to run... He kept me safe!

137
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,000
But I was too scared to move!

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm sorry!

139
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,980
It's okay... I'm sorry.

140
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,330
You and Kurt did your best.

141
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,740
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.

142
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,710
I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...

143
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,420
Welcome home, Reina-chan.

144
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,850
You must be hungry.

145
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,520
Let's eat together.

146
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,830
Hey...

147
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,490
Why don't you join us?

148
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,730
No... I'll pass.

149
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,610
Don't say that.

150
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,100
You saved Reina-chan.

151
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,310
Please let us feed you.

152
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,010
That isn't what I was doing...

153
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,850
See ya.

154
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,610
Damn...

155
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,760
I've returned the favor, okay?

156
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,370
Damn that stupid octopus!

157
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,250
He never should've let me live!

158
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you...

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,650
Let's eat.

160
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,130
Let's eat

161
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,950
together.

162
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,770
Huh?

163
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,350
What's going on?

164
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,930
What... What's wrong?

165
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,300
Reina and Brovada return home.

166
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,800
Hello? Is this Colt?

167
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,690
It's me.

168
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,700
The politicians have turned this
into an international crisis.

169
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,200
The Ants are no longer involved.

170
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,490
No longer involved?

171
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,960
Is that actually possible?

172
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,720
That's what politicians do.

173
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,730
You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.

174
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,170
Magical Beast...

175
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,900
Well, if they label you as a good
Magical Beast, you'll be fine.

176
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,100
Any changes on your side?

177
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,750
Actually, something has been bothering me.

178
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,920
Something bothering you?

179
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,180
Yeah, it's Reina.

180
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,540
No! You're wrong!

181
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,240
She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.

182
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,280
What is it, then?

183
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm not Reina!

184
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,870
My name

185
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,380
is Kite!

186
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,600
Gon!

187
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,010
Killua!

188
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,820
Doctor...

189
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,030
How's Gon?

190
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,910
He's still in critical condition.

191
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,950
I wouldn't recommend sending
him to a specialist

192
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,920
until he can be taken off life support.

193
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,220
I've never seen or heard of anything like this.

194
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,480
How could this happen overnight
to a twelve-year-old boy?

195
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,800
I understand.

196
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,310
We'll bring the specialist here.

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,940
He's a hero who's earned special treatment.

198
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,550
I will cover all the expenses.

199
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,940
If necessary, we may have to
rebuild this entire hospital.

200
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,950
In any case,

201
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,230
we cannot let Gon die.

202
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,630
In the end,

203
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,330
you did everything by yourself...

204
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,730
I want that one myself!

205
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,820
I get it.

206
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,640
Kite saved your life, and he
has no connection to me.

207
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,570
But... Still...

208
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,220
I wanted you to ask for my
help in defeating Pitou!

209
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,930
Let's go.

210
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,540
Did you say that to me as a teammate?

211
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,480
Or as a friend?

212
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,180
I know...

213
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,490
This is just a tantrum.

214
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,950
It's the same as always.

215
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,950
You run ahead,

216
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,950
while I clean up after you.

217
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,670
The same as always...

218
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,340
I'll clean up your mess!

219
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,510
But this time, I won't let it slide.

220
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,590
You have to apologize.

221
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm going to

222
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,820
heal you up!

223
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,520
So you have to apologize!

224
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,230
Killua...

225
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,120
We're assembling a team of
medical specialists to save Gon.

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,780
I must head back, so I can use
Hide and Seek to transport

227
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,600
equipment and people.

228
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,650
Will you come with me?

229
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,390
No, I won't.

230
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,330
That's true...

231
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,590
It's important to stay with Gon
and talk to him, as well.

232
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,020
I'm going to save Gon.

233
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,610
You go get those doctors.

234
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,650
They'll still be needed...

235
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,040
While I'm gone.

236
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,960
Killua?

237
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,340
I'm the one who'll save Gon!

238
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,270
Uh, I am Netero...

239
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,730
I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own.

240
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,420
The next chairman will be selected by election.

241
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,510
I am setting the condition that
all Hunters must vote.

242
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,520
If voter turnout is under 95%,
the results will be invalid.

243
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,030
I ask that the Zodiacs handle the details,
such as schedule and polling method.

244
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,880
I'd say the difficulty for this mission is D-rank.

245
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm counting on you all.

246
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,390
Take care.

247
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,110
In response to Netero's message,

248
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,820
the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders,
assembled at headquarters that day.

249
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,080
Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.

250
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,040
I won't say anything until I've seen your face.

251
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm going to heal you up,

252
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,100
so you have to apologize!
