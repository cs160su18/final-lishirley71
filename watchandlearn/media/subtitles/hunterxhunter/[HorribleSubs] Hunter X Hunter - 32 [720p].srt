2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:11,490
Shroud

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,200
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,430
Naturally,

23
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,770
my double is no mere illusion.

24
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,110
It exists as a second me until I send it away.

25
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,260
You know this after suffering
an attack from my double.

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,370
In other words, you must fight both of my selves.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,710
This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
completed through the mastery of Nen.

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,590
I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!

29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,590
A x Surprising x Win

30
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,600
Kastro has used Nen to create
a double of himself.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,910
And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist,

32
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,600
has severed Hisoka's right arm.

33
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,190
Who will emerge victorious?

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,580
What's this?

35
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,930
Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,130
Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,670
Wow!

38
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,440
His right arm has disappeared,
and cards rain down!

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,900
What does he intend to do?!

40
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,040
Now, then...

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
I have cards here, from one to thirteen.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,780
Pick a number from these,

43
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,370
and picture it in your head.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,120
Pick a number?

45
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,380
Are you ready?

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,410
Once you have your number, add four,

47
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,130
and double the result.

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,140
After that, subtract six, and divide by two.

49
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,080
Finally, subtract your original number,

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,390
and what do you have?

51
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,060
Um...

52
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,970
Hey, did he say to subtract six?

53
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,900
Jeez, I don't know!

54
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,400
I already know your answer.

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,120
The answer is one.

56
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,730
He's right!

57
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,950
How?

58
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,130
Seriously?

59
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,000
This is very strange...

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,260
Insane!

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,050
A satanic magic trick!

62
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,770
And he's incorporated his own
injury into the trick!

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,890
Why is he so calm?

64
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,660
The trick is worth no points.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,890
That had no effect on the match,

66
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,790
but he's performing tricks!

67
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,770
Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!

68
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
You may keep this as a souvenir.

69
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,060
Scumbag.

70
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,160
I will sever your left arm,

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
so you can never mock anyone again.

72
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,350
Did you not hear me the first time?

73
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,750
You may have it.

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,630
Your wish will be granted!

75
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,920
Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!

76
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!

77
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,080
What is he thinking?!

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,090
What?

79
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,150
As expected, you attacked with your double.

80
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,230
Had you, yourself, attacked,
I would have countered.

81
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,950
With this.

82
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,950
Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,160
This is another magic trick.

84
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,210
Can you guess the secret behind it?

85
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,610
He's lying...

86
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,190
He's obviously employing Nen
to accomplish this feat.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,340
But what type of Nen is he using?

88
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,920
What's wrong?

89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
Are you frightened?

90
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,560
You're surprised because you
don't understand my trick.

91
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,860
That's how magic works.

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,870
But now I understand your ability.

94
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,250
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.

95
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,870
And I know how to counter that attack.

96
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,220
It's quite unfortunate.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,190
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.

98
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,700
That was why I spared your life.

99
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,120
Here is a prediction...

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,890
You will die, in a frenzied dance.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,650
Silence!

102
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,530
H-How did he pick me out?

103
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,700
Doubles are created in the original's image,

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,790
so they tend to be pristine.

105
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,660
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.

106
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,670
Oh?

107
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,340
Did you not realize this?

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,350
What is going on here?

109
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,030
This sequence of events is
impossible to understand!

110
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,740
Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?

111
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,720
Don't bother.

112
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
I hit you in the chin,

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
so you'll have difficulty moving for a while.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,250
Meaning that you won't be able
to evade my next attack.

115
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,520
What?

116
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,250
Where did this attack come from?

117
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,100
No, I don't have time for that...

118
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,720
I must use a double to block the cards!

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,220
You can't create another double.

120
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,710
You need intense focus to
create a double with Nen.

121
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,650
The only reason you were able
to use doubles freely

122
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,610
was because you had a normal state of mind.

123
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,700
Using Nen to replicate and manipulate

124
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,830
something as complex as a human being

125
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,960
is extremely difficult.

126
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,650
Just how difficult is it?

127
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,980
By the time you've learned to use a double,

128
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,930
you've forgotten how to use
Nen for anything else.

129
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,930
I call that running out of memory.

130
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,250
You lost because you wasted memory space.

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Kastro can no longer stand!

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,110
Hisoka wins by knockout!

133
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,530
Hisoka...

134
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,390
Good work.

135
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,530
Now, show me that injury.

136
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,730
I was never absolutely certain,

137
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,120
but today's match confirmed it.

138
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,770
You are an idiot.

139
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,620
Perhaps.

140
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,650
Why do you endanger yourself this way?

141
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,630
Was that meant as a
performance or something?

142
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,930
Who knows?

143
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,640
Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid.

144
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,650
I'll stop your bleeding first.

145
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,040
Hey, hey.

146
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,190
Please try to be gentle.

147
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura.

148
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,360
I'll start with the left arm.

149
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,680
Here I go.

150
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,270
Nen Stitches.

151
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,680
Nen Stitches

152
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,810
Okay, all done.

153
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,240
Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles.

154
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,570
Basically, it's one hundred percent connected.

155
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
An excellent job.

156
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,960
Next,

157
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,290
I'll do your right arm.

158
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,960
Hold it yourself this time.

159
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,760
I'm always mesmerized by your skill.

160
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,650
Perhaps I get myself injured

161
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,440
so I can watch you work your magic.

162
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,930
Right.

163
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,320
Twenty million for the left arm.

164
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,700
Fifty million for the right.

165
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,440
Pay up. Now.

166
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,030
I'll send the money to your account.

167
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,250
All right.

168
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,840
You can treat the rest of
your injuries yourself.

169
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,950
You could provide better service.

170
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,760
You should be able to manage
with your Bungee Gum

171
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,460
and Texture Surprise.

172
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,250
Oh...

173
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,460
I should probably conceal this.

174
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,470
That way,

175
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,690
they'll think my arms were
healed during the match.

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,980
This is an ordinary scarf,
with no special features.

177
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,480
I use Bungee Gum

178
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,850
to attach it to my arm.

179
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,480
Then I use Texture Surprise
to create a layer of skin.

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,990
He's so fast...

181
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,680
That was fast enough to fool a Nen master

182
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,970
into believing the arm had actually healed,

183
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,500
before he even knew what was happening.

184
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,500
Next, I'll do the left.

185
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,010
Bungee Gum...

186
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:03,510
Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)

187
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,720
He molds his aura into a substance

188
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,510
with the properties of rubber and gum.

189
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,620
It can stretch, swiftly contract,

190
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,450
adhere to most substances,

191
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,520
and be removed at any time.

192
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,520
By the way, I call this Bungee Gum
because when I was a child,

193
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
that was the name of my
favorite chewing gum.

194
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,530
I didn't need to know that.

195
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,030
Texture Surprise...

196
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:34,040
Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)

197
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,460
He combines aura with the power of his imagination,

198
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,500
to reproduce the appearance of skin.

199
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,770
Essentially, it's a high-quality copy,
so you can tell it's fake if you touch it.

200
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,540
However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill...

201
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,080
The name Texture Surprise
comes from the stickers

202
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,470
that were included with a popular snack

203
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,300
a while back.

204
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,310
Like I said, I didn't need to know that.

205
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,740
But weren't you impressed by my application

206
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,500
of these two abilities during the fight?

207
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,380
Huh?

208
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,320
You saw everything, didn't you?

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Well, yeah...

210
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,500
As a distraction,

211
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,680
you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,

212
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,330
while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd

213
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,280
stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum.

214
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,840
The aura from each was also tied

215
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,340
to your right arm.

216
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,910
Additionally, you connected aura to
the thirteen cards on the floor,

217
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,600
and held the ends with your left hand.

218
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,600
Then,

219
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,020
when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,

220
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,900
You may keep this as a souvenir.

221
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,420
the aura in your left hand was released.

222
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,400
And connected.

223
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,910
The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.

224
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,170
But Kastro never noticed.

225
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,270
You employed one of the basic techniques,

226
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,640
Zetsu, to help mask your aura.

227
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,930
However, there was a flaw...

228
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,870
Yes, someone trained in Ren,

229
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,010
another of the basic techniques,

230
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,190
could have focused the Nen in their eyes,

231
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,870
to see through your plan.

232
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,690
That's why you

233
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,690
used that twisted magic trick
to throw him off guard,

234
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,700
while you pretended to be
reserving your strength.

235
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,650
It even worked as camouflage,
convincing him that your lack of aura

236
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,570
was a sign of confidence.

237
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,960
After meticulously confirming
that your plan was working,

238
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,460
you extended a thread of
aura from your left hand,

239
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,920
the same one holding the cards,
and connected it to Kastro's chin.

240
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,470
Your preparations were now complete.

241
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,010
You'd already used Texture Surprise

242
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,730
to alter the scarf on the floor
to resemble human skin.

243
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,480
And so,

244
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,820
when Kastro attacked your left arm,

245
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,650
you activated the Bungee Gum

246
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,990
between your right arm and
the scarf on the floor.

247
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,770
Your arm was restored,

248
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,780
and the scarf concealed the wound,

249
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,500
leaving everyone convinced that
your right arm was restored.

250
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,030
However, this performance actually
helped Kastro to calm down.

251
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,420
It made no sense for a severed arm

252
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,510
to reappear in a pristine state...

253
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:39,520
Kastro realized that I was
using Nen, not magic.

254
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,980
But you didn't miss the subtle change
in his psychological state.

255
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,500
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.

256
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,530
But now I understand your ability.

257
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,180
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.

258
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,540
And I know how to counter that attack.

259
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,070
It's quite unfortunate.

260
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,540
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.

261
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,780
That was why I spared your life.

262
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,680
Kastro was about to recover.

263
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,110
Here is a prediction...

264
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,680
You will die, in a frenzied dance.

265
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,680
But then you pushed him over the edge.

266
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,190
Silence!

267
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,900
H-How did he pick me out?

268
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,570
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.

269
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,100
You exposed the weakness of his doubles.

270
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,380
But had he stayed composed,
he had a fair chance.

271
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,420
However...

272
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,420
Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...

273
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,100
And he lost.

274
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,700
You realize that those two abilities

275
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,110
are perfect for you.

276
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,670
As opposed to Kastro's doubles,

277
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,690
if my opponent knows of my abilities,

278
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,000
I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.

279
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,000
Well,

280
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,910
I'm off.

281
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,920
Already?

282
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,790
My job is done, so I'm not sticking around.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,130
Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,

284
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,010
don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached.

285
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,210
Oh, that's right.

286
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,020
I came here for a reason.

287
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,480
I have new orders.

288
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,330
All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City

289
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,010
by noon, August 30th, not just
those who find it convenient.

290
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,530
Will the boss be coming?

291
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,530
Most likely.

292
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,810
This could be our biggest job yet.

293
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,990
If you skip this one,

294
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,850
the boss might hunt you down himself.

295
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,910
How very scary.

296
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,050
Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?

297
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,550
A pity.

298
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,700
Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?

299
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,980
It was boring.

300
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,570
Did Hisoka win?

301
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,580
I was lying.

302
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,580
It was an incredible fight.

303
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,590
I hate to admit this, but I have
no idea how Hisoka won.

304
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,410
You couldn't tell?

305
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,590
Gon,

306
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,100
we need to learn more about Nen.

307
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,180
Yeah!

308
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,870
He doesn't talk.

309
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,240
He doesn't talk about the past.

310
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,380
He has no interest in the past.

311
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,880
By tomorrow, I imagine he'll
have forgotten Kastro's face.

312
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,890
He doesn't associate with others.

313
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,190
He's his own man.

314
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,650
Because he believes himself

315
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,580
to be the strongest.

316
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,130
Oh, I forgot to remove this.

317
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
Spider...

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,740
I found some new toys to play with.

319
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,820
I suppose it's time to start the hunt.

320
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,150
Hisoka has been masquerading
as a Phantom Troupe member.

321
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,020
To him, the Phantom Troupe
is simply another target.

322
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

323
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

324
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

325
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

326
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

327
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

328
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

329
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

330
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:18,910
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

331
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,530
Today, we introduce Kastro.

332
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,740
A 200s-class warrior.

333
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,790
He can use the Tiger Bite Fist.

334
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,610
He can create a clone of himself with Nen.

335
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,500
Combines release and
incarnation techniques,

336
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,150
Doubles are tough to deal with.

337
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,770
With this double, I can use the real Tiger Bite Fist!

338
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,830
to duplicate himself.

339
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,170
The True Tiger Bite Fist!

340
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,260
Next time: An x Empty x Threat!

341
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,170
Ah... Ah...

342
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,260
Achoo!

343
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,520
Do I have a cold?

344
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,080
I bet someone's talking about you
behind your back.

345
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,510
Is it Mito-san?
