2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,980
I have a bad feeling.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,480
I feel like I'm missing something.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,510
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.

5
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,990
A x Fated x Awakening

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,580
Kite, Gon, and Killua have
taken care of Hagya's soldiers.

7
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,010
As they head deeper into NGL in
search of the Chimera Ants' nest,

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,530
within the Queen's castle,

9
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:11,140
one of the soon-to-be-born
King's three Royal Guards

10
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,080
is about to awaken.

11
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,640
What kind of magic did they use?

12
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half.

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,580
Impressive.

14
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,090
This one almost looks like he was smashed
by a rock, or some other hard object.

15
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,370
And Baro's the one with an iron shell.

16
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,310
So this is the rare humans' power.

17
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,100
Are you worried now?

18
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,280
The king of the jungle's blood
runs through my veins.

19
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,190
A few humans can't scare me.

20
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,730
Of course...

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,900
Whew, that's a relief.

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,360
I thought I was gonna miss out on tonight's feast.

23
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,170
These must be extremely rare humans.

24
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,620
We'll tear them to shreds and gobble them down!

25
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,990
We're being followed.

26
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,390
Not from there.

27
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,700
There's quite a number of them.

28
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,050
Listen up...

29
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,730
Your job is to distract the enemy,
while attacking from a distance.

30
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,400
Do not get too close.

31
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,200
The 2nd Platoon will take the right,

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,160
as the 3rd Platoon pincers
them from the left.

33
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,120
My 1st Platoon will trap them,
preventing a rear retreat.

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,670
Go!

35
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
Gon and I didn't notice them.

36
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,990
They're coming from the left and the right.

37
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,190
Keep up your guard.

38
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,080
Damn...

39
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,580
The trees are getting in the way.

40
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,960
Yeah.

41
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,340
Shouldn't we get out of the forest?

42
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,680
This is a trap.

43
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,610
Okay, keep up the chase.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
Hagya-sama, all goes according to plan.

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Good work, Flutter.

46
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,530
Once we drive our prey into range,

47
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,180
one strike with my fangs will finish them.

48
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,630
This doesn't feel right...

49
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,290
Eh?

50
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,460
You ordered Flutter to chase the prey,

51
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,240
while you hid in the grass to ambush them.

52
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,870
That's pretty lame.

53
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,630
Huh?

54
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,780
Aren't you the king of the jungle?

55
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,340
A king should face his prey, rather than hiding.

56
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,730
Just jump out and go,
"Roar! Chomp! Ga ha ha ha!"

57
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,750
That's so much cooler.

58
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,140
But you know...

59
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,680
This is how the king of the jungle hunts.

60
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,450
Shut up and watch!

61
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,020
Well, I don't care, so long as I
get to eat the rare humans.

63
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,380
Rare human?

64
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,590
What's that?

65
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,460
I'll explain the details later.

66
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,470
Its number is 4-933.

67
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,990
It was captured and brought
in by Zazan's squadron.

68
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,370
Number 4-933...

69
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,560
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,850
It was probably given to the Queen.

71
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,860
Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,530
She'll give birth to an incredible king.

73
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,730
Don't see 'em.

74
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,390
It must already be inside the Queen's belly.

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,490
Are you certain?

76
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,830
It isn't here...

77
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,560
Where else would it be?

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,500
Could it have escaped?

79
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,060
Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin

80
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,180
will be paralyzed for at least a month.

81
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,380
After a mere three days, it couldn't move around.

82
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,730
You can't be sure when it
concerns the rare ones.

83
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,190
They aren't like normal humans.

84
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,390
You should know that very well.

85
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,320
I'm not the same creature I was before.

86
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,490
The next time I see them,

87
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,850
I'll crush them, rip them apart, and eat them.

88
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,880
The antidote I hid in my
back tooth came in handy.

89
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,920
But I could barely drag myself across the ground.

90
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,810
For the time being, I'll have to hide here...

91
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,400
But what's going on?

92
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
How can a Chimera Ant use Nen?

93
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Could you check once more?

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,180
Come on, give me a break...

95
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,430
I'm busy enough as it is.

96
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,310
Didn't you hear me say the Queen
has a huge appetite now?

97
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,620
I am well aware of that.

98
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,290
I don't know anything about this "rare" stuff,

99
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,900
but why are you so obsessed with this human?

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,740
I'd like to ask it a few questions.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,340
Can't you see the light surrounding his body?

102
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,510
Light?

103
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,460
No, I don't see a thing.

104
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,840
I see.

105
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Then it's true that only some
can identify this power.

106
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,720
Meaning it's a talent.

107
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,030
Exactly.

108
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,780
This talent is my destiny, bestowed
upon me by the heavens.

109
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,230
The power of a chosen few...

110
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,480
If I master this power, I can become the king!

111
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,610
I will be king!

112
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,980
Retreat! Retreat!

113
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,190
Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,210
Wh-What's that?

115
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,340
He's gorgeous!

116
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,990
We're leaving.

117
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,090
Huh?

118
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,330
What about the feast?

119
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,960
He was able to understand
that he was outclassed,

120
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,180
and he calmly backed down at once.

121
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,140
Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader.

122
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,290
I always believed that the world

123
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,100
revolved around my claws and fangs.

124
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,390
That if I brandished them,

125
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,850
I could take the life of any other creature,

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,620
could always satisfy my own hunger...

127
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,940
And that I was truly blessed.

128
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,520
However, that wasn't the case.

129
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,650
Others were stronger,
so I never could have ruled.

130
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,210
Death taught me that lesson.

131
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,490
But I am stronger now.

132
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,320
At the moment, we may not be
strong enough to defeat them.

133
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,350
But now we are armed with the ability to learn.

134
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,920
We're following them.

135
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,940
Their nest must be nearby.

136
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,780
If we follow them,

137
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,670
we will find the Queen.

138
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,880
What is that?

139
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,670
Something is coming!

140
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,530
That was a fascinating conversation...

141
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,560
You mentioned something about talent.

142
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,460
Allow me to take part.

143
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,010
O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!

144
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,470
If I master this power, I can become the king!

145
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,140
I will be the king!

146
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,150
A short and foolish dream...

147
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,760
I am totally outclassed.

148
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,660
I can never escape the position
I've been born into...

149
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,530
You can relax.

150
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,530
Let's talk over there.

151
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,920
Y-Yes!

152
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,780
This power is not for me...

153
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,390
But for this Royal Guard...

154
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,950
And for the King it serves!

155
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,550
This power is for serving them!

156
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,580
Impossible...

157
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,830
What is that

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,290
evil aura?

159
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,680
By the way...

160
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,340
Yes?

161
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,890
Why is a live human underneath those bones?

162
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,590
Hmm... Nyow I understand.

163
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,360
What are you researching?

164
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,870
I'm learning about those rare
humans you mentioned.

165
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,430
I've attempted to study them many times,

166
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,500
but it wasn't written in any books.

167
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Asking one of them is faster
than flipping through books.

168
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,240
Wasn't that why you were looking for him?

169
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,020
Th-That's exactly right.

170
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,070
There we go.

171
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,910
Ah!

172
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,060
"New memories are stored
in the hippocampus,

173
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,590
while old memories are kept
in the cerebral cortex.

174
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,160
To invoke those memories..."

175
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,620
Nyow I understand.

176
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,200
Ah, you... Come over here.

177
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,310
Hatsu is a technique for
manipulating aura at will.

178
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,640
To summarize the categories of Nen users...

179
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,240
They are:

180
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,170
Enhancers,

181
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,670
Transmuters,

182
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,310
Conjurers,

183
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,780
Emitters,

184
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,980
Manipulators,

185
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,170
and Specialists,

186
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,040
for a total of six categories.

187
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,250
C-Categories...

188
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,910
Every Nen user belongs to one of these.

189
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,990
You want to increase the amount of your aura,

190
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,230
as well as the speed of its flow.

191
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,570
Most of your basic training will
be spent on these two tasks.

192
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,160
In a battle between Nen users,

193
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,490
those are the factors that...

194
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,960
That...

195
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,000
Th-that are pivotal

196
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,490
in determining the victor.

197
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,930
Nyow I understand...

198
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,810
In addition to the basic Nen
abilities Zetsu and Ren,

199
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,110
there are also unique techniques that reflect

200
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,010
the Nen user's individuality.

201
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,860
If you develop a technique that synchronizes
with your style and Nen category,

202
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,740
the manifestation of your ability has
a better chance of being stronger.

203
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,120
And how do you identify which
Nen category you belong to?

204
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,740
Water divination

205
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,480
is the simplest

206
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,260
and most commonly used method.

207
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,990
Water divination?

208
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,380
Give it a try, Rammot.

209
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,760
Right.

210
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,590
Since the water's overflowing,

211
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,000
that makes you an Enhancer.

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,480
An Enhancer?

213
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,620
Which confirms that Rammot is a Nen user?

214
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,940
Seems so.

215
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, yeah...

216
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,400
Didn't you say you fought a rare human?

217
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,500
Y-Yes.

218
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,630
The impact from its attack opened your pores...

219
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,390
And released your aura.

220
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,260
Pores?

221
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,270
Apparently, they're small holes all over your body.

222
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,130
If they're sealed, aura can't be released.

223
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,270
I see...

224
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,700
Colt also thought that Rammot's change

225
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,170
was triggered by his fight
with the rare humans.

226
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,320
It seems he was correct.

227
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,640
So if Rammot is a Nen user now,

228
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,900
can we use him to open everyone's pores?

229
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,190
Sure, sounds good.

230
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,730
I think I'll give this a try.

231
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,310
The leaf wilted...

232
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,700
Unbelievable.

233
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,290
One of us was born possessing Nen ability,

234
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,820
without having to fight a rare human!

235
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,100
Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist,

236
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,200
not belonging to another category?

237
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,830
Neferpitou.

238
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,380
Huh?

239
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,340
That is the name the Queen gave me.

240
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,590
From now on, call me Neferpitou.

241
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,900
Right!

242
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,770
I don't need him anymore.

243
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,010
Feed him to the Queen now.

244
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,940
Right!

245
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,120
From birth, Neferpitou already
possessed incredible power.

246
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,020
This presence casts a dark shadow over the fates

247
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,440
of Gon and his friends.

248
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,090
Next time: Light x And x Darkness.

249
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,760
Wake up!

250
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,590
C'mon, it's morning.

251
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,130
It's 10:50.

252
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,610
I'll kill-you-a!
