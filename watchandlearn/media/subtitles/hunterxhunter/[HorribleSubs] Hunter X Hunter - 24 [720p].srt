In the Dentora region

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,510
of the Republic of Padokea,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,300
Kukuroo Mountain.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,670
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,010
Lamentation Tours

11
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,570
I have a message for you from Kil...

12
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,280
"Thank you for coming.

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
I really appreciate it.

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,120
But I can't see you right now.

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,400
Sorry."

16
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,950
The x Zoldyck x Family

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,230
Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio have advanced

18
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,910
a little closer to the mansion.

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,330
Meanwhile...

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,390
I'm home.

21
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,850
Well, no one's around.

22
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,850
Welcome back.

23
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,600
How did work go?

24
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,450
Fine.

25
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,110
Does that mean you dispatched your target?

26
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,940
I'm sure you were watching me
from a distance.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,020
Mom's waiting for you inside.

28
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,990
I don't want to see her.

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,750
Ah.

30
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,960
Did you need something?

31
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,250
I wanted to say hello.

32
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,170
Are you new here?

33
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,810
Yes.

34
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,810
While you were away,
I was hired as an apprentice butler.

35
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,180
My name is Canary.

36
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,290
Here. You can have this.

37
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,380
No, thank you.

38
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,920
But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama.

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,690
Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.

40
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,720
I cannot do that.

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,710
I am a servant.

42
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,790
And you are my employer.

43
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,260
Tsk... That's lame.

44
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,340
You were using the Shadow Step, right?

45
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,330
Shadow Step?

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,340
The technique where you move silently,
so you won't be noticed.

47
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,210
It's one of the first assassination
techniques we learn

48
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,090
in the Zoldyck family.

49
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,140
Is that so?

50
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,970
I must have learned it while
growing up in Meteor City.

51
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,480
Meteor City?

52
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,860
My hometown.

53
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,030
It's a city that has been erased from this world.

54
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,430
Huh, never heard of it.

55
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,060
You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.

56
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,440
That's why many members

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,600
of the mafia and the Phantom
Troupe come from there.

58
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,040
I'd like to visit some time.

59
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,430
When you visit, I can serve as your guide.

60
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,930
I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.

61
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,890
Rhythm Echo?

62
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,190
It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.

63
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,450
You move at a certain rhythm,
creating afterimages.

64
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,410
I see...

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,070
It appears we have intruders.

66
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,640
Many intruders.

67
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,090
Let Mike handle it.

68
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,710
The master has ordered that
Mike be restrained today.

69
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,720
They wish to test my abilities.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,840
We'll split up and look for their mansion.

71
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Leave.

72
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,780
Who are you?

73
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,250
There is no need for me to answer that question.

74
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,100
You are trespassing on private property.

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,790
I cannot allow you to pass without permission.

76
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,790
Can you stop us?

77
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,610
It's obvious that you stand no chance.

78
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,050
Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life.

79
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,880
If you take one step past this line,

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
I shall use force to remove you.

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
What was that?

82
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,060
You can stand back and watch, boss...

83
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,440
We'll take care of this.

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's go!

85
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,150
Don't mock us!

86
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,040
Bitch!

87
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,210
Get her!

88
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,820
Do you wish to continue?

89
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,540
After all that, she hasn't
even broken a sweat...

90
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,200
Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?

91
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,510
Hardly.

92
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,970
I am but an apprentice butler.

93
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,120
With your abilities,

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,420
you're not even a match for the butlers,

95
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,880
let alone the Zoldyck family.

96
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,350
A futile effort...

97
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,430
I'm telling you that it's useless!

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,090
As a Hunter,

99
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,970
I cannot allow a little girl
like you to defeat me.

100
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,560
Prepare yourself!

101
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,060
What?

102
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,490
Die!

103
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,510
I-I'm sorry!

104
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,460
Please spare my life!

105
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,510
Zebro-san...

106
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,110
You noticed my presence?

107
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,680
Could you clean this up?

108
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,770
Sure, that's my job.

109
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,830
Plus, Mike is starving.

110
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,710
Huh?

111
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,030
H-Help!

112
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,720
You already knew the Rhythm Echo.

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,550
Yes... Forgive me.

114
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,800
You think you're stronger than I am.

115
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,020
Absolutely not.

116
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,250
Really?

117
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,240
So, I don't have anyone to play with.

118
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,310
Will you be my friend, Canary?

119
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,650
I apologize, Killua-sama.

120
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,550
Tsk. Lame...

121
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,220
Let's be friends!

122
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,570
Gon...

123
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:22,160
Hunter Vocabulary

124
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,160
Canary

125
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,930
Is she okay?

126
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,170
Yeah.

127
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,260
She's only unconscious.

128
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,050
Wake up!

129
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,430
Oh. Morning, Bro.

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,190
What time is it?

131
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,690
Don't be too arrogant, Kil!

132
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,410
What?

133
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,250
I feel really bad about stabbing you, Bro.

134
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,200
Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro.

135
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,240
You're lying!

136
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,920
You can tell?

137
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,970
Tsk!

138
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,840
Hello?

139
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,650
Oh, Mama?

140
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,680
Uh-huh.

141
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,500
Yep, I understand.

142
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,080
Kil,

143
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,190
your friends are near the butler's office.

144
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,310
How about it, Kil?

145
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,570
If I ask Mama, those three can become...

146
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,360
Milluki.

147
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,420
If you so much as touch them, I'll kill you.

148
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,580
Forgive me for not introducing myself.

149
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,860
I am Killua's mother.

150
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,300
This is Kalluto.

151
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,180
Why can't Killua come see us?

152
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,680
Because he's in solitary confinement.

153
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,050
Solitary confinement?

154
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,910
Kil stabbed me and his brother
before he ran away from home.

155
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,110
That is the story he told us.

156
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,360
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.

157
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,620
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.

158
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,250
So we do not know when he will leave...

159
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,130
What? Father! What are you doing?!

160
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,120
Don't do anything hasty!

161
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,130
He's finally returned!

162
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm coming in.

163
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,200
One Kill Per Day

164
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,650
That's enough, Mil.

165
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,610
But, Grandpa Zeno...

166
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,080
He isn't sorry at all.

167
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,530
I know that.

168
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,060
Kil, you can go.

169
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,410
Okay.

170
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,910
Man, that hurt.

171
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,340
Bro, I'm not sorry.

172
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,780
But I do feel bad.

173
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,300
So I let you slap me around.

174
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,620
What was that?

175
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,850
Kil, Silva wants to see you.

176
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,730
Dad?

177
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,050
Okay.

178
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,230
Damn it!

179
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,530
You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!

180
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,060
That's why he's such an uppity brat...

181
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,830
He's special.

182
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,600
Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?

183
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,410
It's incredible, sure.

184
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,280
He's probably the most talented
Zoldyck in history?

185
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,270
Mama seems to think so.

186
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,020
I have to agree.

187
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,140
Considerable praise.

188
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,190
But he fails as an assassin

189
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,790
because he's so moody.

190
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,060
Moody?

191
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,900
A kid who wants to make friends
can't lead the Zoldyck family.

192
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,220
In the end, he's just a crybaby.

193
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,060
Mentally weak.

194
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,380
That is true...

195
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,600
Right? Take me.

196
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,730
I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,990
Oh, that's right.

198
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,390
The bomb I'll use next time
is awesome, Grandpa!

199
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,840
It's super-compact.

200
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,310
I attached it to a female mosquito,

201
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,600
and it's triggered to explode when the
mosquito sucks the target's blood.

202
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,760
But the problem is getting the mosquito
to recognize the target...

203
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,810
Mil...

204
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,190
You're a bright boy,

205
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,030
but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help.

206
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,760
Oh, why must Father be this way?

207
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,060
Something has come up.

208
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,200
So I bid you farewell.

209
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,950
Please wait!

210
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,460
We'll be staying in town for a while.

211
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,960
Please let Killua know.

212
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,630
Very well. I shall tell him.

213
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,710
Goodbye.

214
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,220
Who are you?

215
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,600
Killua's friends.

216
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,000
Friends...

217
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,800
Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?

218
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,980
Come over here!

219
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,650
Yes, Mother.

220
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,780
I probably shouldn't say it,
but these people creep me out...

221
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,780
And I bet they were lying about Killua's
saying that he can't see us.

222
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,870
Gon, we can't go back yet.

223
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,660
How about we tail them?

224
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,170
Sure, but if we do that,

225
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,800
she'll take the blame.

226
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,700
Oh, right...

227
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,870
I will take you to the butler's office.

228
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,490
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.

229
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,270
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...

230
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,010
Zeno-sama?

231
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,760
Killua-sama's grandfather.

232
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,390
Kil.

233
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,510
I heard that you've made some friends?

234
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,790
Yeah.

235
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,320
What sort of people are they?

236
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,600
What sort of...?

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,300
They're people I enjoy being with.

238
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,870
I see.

239
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,470
How was the Exam?

240
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,860
It was easy.

241
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,120
Kil, come over here.

242
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,810
Huh?

243
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,440
I want you to tell me more.

244
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,090
What did you do during the Exam?

245
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,640
Who did you meet? How did you feel?

246
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,060
You can tell me anything...

247
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,330
Okay.

248
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,280
I can't believe this.

249
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,510
Father didn't even ask me first.

250
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,340
Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa...

251
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,350
I won't forgive them!

252
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,560
And guess what Gon said next...

253
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,370
He didn't want his legs cut off,

254
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,590
but he didn't want to surrender, either!

255
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,540
He's so self-centered.

256
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,070
Sounds like an interesting boy.

257
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,390
And then his opponent

258
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,980
pointed a blade at Gon's forehead,
but Gon still...

259
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,940
Kil.

260
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,740
Huh?

261
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,530
Do you want to see your friends?

262
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,720
You don't need to hold back.

263
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,140
Tell me the truth.

264
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,850
Thinking back,

265
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,490
we've never had a father-son chat before.

266
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,430
I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.

267
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,080
And I raised you the same way.

268
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
You and I are different.

269
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,680
I didn't realize that until you left home.

270
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,590
You are my son.

271
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,580
But you are your own person.

272
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Live as you please.

273
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,960
If you get tired, you can come home.

274
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,840
I'll ask you one more time.

275
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,310
Do you want to see your friends?

276
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,340
Uh-huh.

277
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,420
I understand.

278
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,770
You're free now.

279
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,270
But...

280
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,360
Promise me one thing.

281
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,700
Never betray your friends.

282
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,680
Understand?

283
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,830
I promise.

284
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,870
I'll never betray them.

285
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,760
Never.

286
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,140
Kil.

287
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,020
It's too late. Those three left.

288
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,610
Return to your cell.

289
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,130
No way. I'm leaving.

290
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,800
Kil!

291
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,150
Out of my way.

292
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,240
Oh, Kil...

293
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,150
Your eyes are so cold now...

294
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,050
What were you thinking?

295
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,210
Kil was finally home!

296
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,420
For now, we'll let him do what he wants.

297
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,830
No! What are you saying?

298
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,020
This is a critical juncture in the process

299
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,300
of determining if he's qualified
to lead the family!

300
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,280
So you understand what's at stake.

301
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,300
Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!

302
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,810
He'll come home one day.

303
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,500
Because he is my son.

304
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,520
Killua has been set free.

305
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,830
But Silva declares that Killua
will return as an assassin.

306
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,590
Meanwhile, Gon and his friends
head to the butler's office.

307
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,030
Will they be able to see Killua?

308
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,300
Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!

309
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,340
Eye for an eye.

310
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,680
Eye for a tooth?

311
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,350
Tooth for a tooth!
