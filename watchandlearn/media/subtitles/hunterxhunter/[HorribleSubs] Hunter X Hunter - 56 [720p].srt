2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,150
That is most likely a Conjurer's work.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,050
Yeah, that's gotta be it.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,060
These buildings weren't here yesterday.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,470
This has to be Nen.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,840
Man, these guys are really crazy...

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,420
They have someone who can
conjure entire buildings!

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,170
It's safe to assume that
they're rigged somehow.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,160
Yeah.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,180
That tells us they're still using
this place as their base.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,980
The problem is

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,170
that these buildings create
too many blind spots.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,680
I can only watch twenty
percent of the area at a time.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,780
However,

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,280
if you move around too much,
you could run into one of them.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,940
I'd like to avoid that.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,540
I mean,

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,020
I have no idea what I'd do if I
heard their voices behind me...

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,200
My heart is pounding.

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,480
Voices?

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,200
Huh?

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,410
Oh, never mind. I read you.

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,230
For now, return to your original position.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,900
I'll call you back in five minutes.

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,600
Hello? Melody?

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,960
How's it going on your side?

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,950
We're still shopping.

28
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,670
Let me see that one.

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,560
This might be harder than
regular bodyguard work.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
It's not too bad...

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,900
Basho's about to snap.

32
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,770
Let's go back to the other store.

33
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,220
Yes, I know.

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,060
Beloved x And x Beleaguered

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,190
You've already told me everything that Uvo

36
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,640
knew about the chain user?

37
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,250
Yeah, when we were investigating

38
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,110
the Nostrade Family using the Hunter website,

39
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,580
Uvo pointed to three members at the top.

40
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,960
It was late night on the 1st when we realized
they were the daughter's bodyguards.

41
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,460
And I met that daughter yesterday.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
And that's when you stole her power.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,470
Yeah.

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,470
And here is an updated list of bodyguards.

45
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,850
There are two new members.

46
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,180
Wow.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,050
They already have new information up?

48
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,280
Seven bodyguards...

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,050
Perhaps more.

50
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,460
That's a lot of people to guard one girl.

51
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,990
He must love his daughter.

52
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,490
He probably cares more about her ability.

53
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,480
Her father achieved his current
status by using her power.

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,380
There are many who resent his advancement.

55
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,920
But why did she come to Yorknew City?

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
For the auction, I'd imagine.

57
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,720
Boss?

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,930
Shizuku, Pakunoda...

59
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,750
Yes?

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,670
Nice...

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,140
Actually, I'm an idiot.

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,940
Damn, what's wrong with me?

63
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,320
If I'd stopped to consider why their
boss' daughter is in Yorknew City,

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,450
we could have found the chain user sooner.

65
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,420
It's safe to assume that this
girl came to Yorknew City

66
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,200
for the auction.

67
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,700
I was too focused on her fortunetelling
to give any regard to that.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,140
According to the website,

69
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,370
this girl also collects body parts.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,910
Body parts...

71
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,470
The Scarlet Eyes!

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,750
Yes.

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,220
The chain user joined the
Nostrade Family for a reason.

74
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,130
He knew that the Scarlet Eyes
would be sold at the auction,

75
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,720
and that Nostrade's daughter
would be interested in them.

76
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,290
The chain user desires two things.

77
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,580
To exact revenge upon us,
and to recover his people's eyes.

78
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,990
Shal, were we able to steal the Scarlet Eyes?

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,410
Sorry, I'm not sure.

80
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,250
I had the auctioneer running on
autopilot throughout the auction.

81
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,010
Kortopi, do you remember
copying the Scarlet Eyes?

82
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,880
I copied them.

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,590
Your copies function as En.

84
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,130
Can you tell where the copy is?

85
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,290
If I'm touching the real one.

86
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
Found them.

87
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,920
Got it.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,660
There's something of the same shape

89
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,160
approximately 2,500 meters in that direction.

90
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,660
Is the chain user there?

91
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,630
We should hurry.

92
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,130
The En effect will fade in a few hours.

93
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,920
Do you have a map?

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,370
Here.

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,850
North-northwest...

96
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,270
2,500 meters.

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,940
Hotel Beitacle.

98
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,320
Boss...

99
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,680
Let me go.

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,180
Please.

101
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,060
Very well.

102
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,360
But I shall accompany you.

103
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,470
Yes, sir.

104
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,070
Paku, Machi, Shizuku,

105
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,740
you're coming, too.

106
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,100
Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi.

107
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,210
Okay.

108
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,900
Hello?

109
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,490
Oh, Killua-kun?

110
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,260
Yeah, who are you?

111
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,060
One of Kurapika's colleagues.

112
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,820
Could you look to your left?

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,120
Hang up,

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,470
and then whisper a command to me.

115
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,470
Raise your right hand.

116
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,830
Her ears are super sharp!

117
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,300
We can use this to our advantage.

118
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,320
What?

119
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,490
Didn't we already try this place before?

120
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,530
Hotel Beitacle is one of the places

121
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,560
where the Nostrade Family is staying.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Yeah, but when Shal checked the website,

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
they'd already checked out.

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,570
They probably checked into that
hotel under a different name.

125
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,400
They're being cautious.

126
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,130
The rain keeps me from
hearing what's being said,

127
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,560
but people are talking over there.

128
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,390
Judging by the footsteps,
five or six, including women.

129
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,760
They're heading in the opposite
direction from those ruined buildings.

130
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,330
That's amazing.

131
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,720
Gon and I have trained hard,
but I can't hear a thing.

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,400
This happens to be my power.

133
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,580
Kurapika must be getting desperate...

134
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,410
He actually asked me for help.

135
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,060
Huh?

136
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,510
He wants to do everything himself, right?

137
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,720
Oh...

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,410
Yeah, that's true.

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,670
Are you an assassin?

140
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,090
I used to be.

141
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,420
How did you know?

142
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,550
Your footsteps.

143
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,070
You're right next to me, but they're estinto.

144
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,430
Es-what?

145
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,890
Estinto...

146
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,680
A music term meaning barely audible.

147
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,200
Oh, I'm in the habit of moving
without making any sound.

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,120
You have the quietest step I've ever heard.

149
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,690
Your technique is impressive.

150
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,190
I can see why Kurapika would rely on you.

151
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,950
Well, I'm not too thrilled about this.

152
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,820
Oh? Really?

153
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,700
Stop.

154
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,790
They're one hundred meters
around the next corner.

155
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,260
You can pick out their footsteps?

156
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,300
Everyone's are slightly different.

157
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh...

158
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,060
I'll take a look.

159
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,270
Killua?

160
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,620
The woman's here.

161
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,790
She's with her buddies.

162
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,380
There are six, moving together.

163
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,130
That topknot guy's here, too.

164
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,280
One more thing.

165
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,910
There's one person that
wasn't there yesterday.

166
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,700
He's probably the leader.

167
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,820
Can you describe him?

168
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,980
He's wearing a black coat,

169
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,070
with St. Peter's cross on the back.

170
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,970
He has combed-back black hair.

171
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,950
I can't see his face.

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,210
And they're too alert!

173
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,630
I'm too afraid to circle around in front.

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,350
Let me speak to him.

175
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,660
Where are you now?

176
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,070
In front of the Motoba Building.

177
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,590
They're walking west,
on Continental Street.

178
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,910
There's a station nearby.

179
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,410
Can you make it onto their train?

180
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,350
It depends on the circumstances.

181
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,720
If it's busy, I can manage.

182
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,160
Leorio, take us south.

183
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,210
Okay!

184
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,480
Melody's in the same car as they are.

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,860
This train's headed toward Castor.

186
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,870
I'm in the last car.

187
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,320
Castor...

188
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,490
The auction site's that way.

189
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,780
So is our hotel...

190
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,860
Yeah. Yeah.

191
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,050
I know, Eliza.

192
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm sick of this job!

193
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,070
I should be happy I get to
spend time with the dogs?

194
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,390
Well, it beats taking care of
that spoiled brat, I guess.

195
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,190
I'm fond of Neon-sama,

196
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,950
but she's too active for me.

197
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,400
Look at this, Eliza!

198
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,890
It's so cute!

199
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,930
Well, hang in there a little longer.

200
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,580
I'll find a better job soon enough...

201
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,500
Who's there?

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,420
Room service.

203
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,280
Leave it in front of the door.

204
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,180
Okay, let's eat.

205
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,720
Man, I seriously need to
find a different job...

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,250
I don't have the energy for this.

207
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,070
But I need a job that will support
Eliza and these guys...

208
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,710
That's hard to find...

209
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,570
Huh?

210
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,890
Don't worry.

211
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,550
I'll figure something out.

212
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,050
They got off?

213
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,850
They got off at Liber Station.

214
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,310
They're headed toward the
Saloma Department Store exit.

215
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,610
That's not good.

216
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,910
The hotel's that way.

217
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,310
Seriously?!

218
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,310
They know we switched rooms?

219
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,050
Damn, this isn't funny!

220
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,820
We need to escape fast!

221
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,280
I have to bring these.

222
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,050
The station's over there.

223
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,050
Shouldn't we get closer?

224
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,870
No.

225
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,940
If we get any closer,

226
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,900
they might sense my animosity.

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,130
Gon,

228
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,790
the range I should stay at

229
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,290
is the distance from here
to the station entrance.

230
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,670
I must attack from this distance
if I don't want to be noticed.

231
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,300
It will take approximately 0.5
seconds to land an attack.

232
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,120
That's more than enough
time for them to evade it.

233
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,990
Unless they're distracted...

234
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,680
Spiders!

235
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,390
They're on the move.

236
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,750
Descending slowly.

237
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
An elevator.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
Are they going out?

239
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,080
We should hurry, boss.

240
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,720
We'll apprehend him as a group.

241
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,170
Stay close enough to provide assistance.

242
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,870
Pakunoda,

243
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,430
once we capture him,
get the information on Uvo.

244
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,630
Got it.

245
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,190
After that, Nobunaga,

246
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,550
he's all yours.

247
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,600
Go!

248
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,700
They're running toward the hotel.

249
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,480
They're fast!

250
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,470
Can we get there faster by car?

251
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,330
It's rush hour.

252
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,150
They might be faster on foot.

253
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,510
Kurapika!

254
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,870
Wait here until I contact you.

255
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,570
Wait, Kurapika...

256
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,000
I have a good idea.

257
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,370
Kurapika!

258
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,160
Melody and I are at the station entrance.

259
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,000
Those six ran off to the northwest.

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah, I'm following them!

261
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,150
Wait, you're running after them?

262
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,010
That's dangerous!

263
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,730
They'll notice you!

264
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,870
Stop it!

265
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,800
Hey!

266
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,510
The bastard hung up on me...

267
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,610
Wow! What's that?

268
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,800
They're ninjas...

269
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,370
Target moving forty kilometers
per hour, in a 2:00 direction.

270
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,990
He got in a vehicle.

271
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,170
I was going to wait until I found another job,

272
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,370
but that's no longer an option.

273
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,060
I'm quitting today!

274
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,250
Leorio, where's Gon?

275
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,470
He ran after Kurapika.

276
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,010
I was told to wait,
but I can't just sit around.

277
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,130
I'm driving to Hotel Beitacle,
but I'm stuck in traffic!

278
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,020
Fine!

279
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,030
We're going after Kurapika!

280
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,020
Seriously...

281
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,740
These people just do whatever
the hell they want!

282
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,280
We're being followed.

283
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,310
When did that happen?

284
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,100
Oops.

285
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,030
I was too focused on chasing the target.

286
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,780
Is the chain user behind or in front of us?

287
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,210
Nobunaga, Pakunoda, and Kortopi,
pursue the target ahead.

288
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,090
Roger that.

289
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,520
Did you see them?

290
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,700
I only caught a silhouette.

291
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,260
I couldn't see their faces,
but one is in the alley.

292
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,140
Another is behind the dumpster.

293
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,250
Okay.

294
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,820
Keep using Gyo.

295
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,680
Yes, sir.

296
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,420
Spiders...

297
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,700
Come and get it!

298
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
Stop it, Kurapika.

299
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,330
We can't fight three of them,

300
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,810
if they know we're here!

301
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,080
Okay, then it's all or nothing.

302
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,340
Gon?!

303
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,630
Sorry!

304
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,210
I'll stop following, so can you let me go?

305
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,480
Him again?

306
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,850
This is the boy he mentioned?

307
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,970
The other one's here, too.

308
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,340
Show yourself.

309
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,150
What do you want?

310
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,810
The Mafia who put a reward on us are gone.

311
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,590
Wh-What? Really?

312
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,570
Why?

313
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,060
What do we do, boss?

314
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,180
Tie them up.

315
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,070
Phinks? It's me.

316
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,330
I need you to come to the Beitacle Hotel.

317
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,720
Shouldn't we just kill them?

318
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,360
No, I trust your instincts.

319
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,740
If they're connected to the
chain user somehow,

320
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,430
we should keep them alive.

321
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,150
I wouldn't trust my instincts...

322
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,010
I have a question for you.

323
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,310
How can you kill people who
have nothing to do with you?

324
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,680
You look pretty hostile,

325
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,830
considering that you just surrendered.

326
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,070
Why, indeed?

327
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,350
Because they have nothing to do with us?

328
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,460
No.

329
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,750
On second thought, it isn't that simple.

330
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,340
How to verbally express our motives...

331
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,270
I'm not fond of it.

332
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,250
But oddly enough...

333
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,580
Or perhaps it's not that odd.

334
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,370
Is that the key to understanding myself?

335
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,980
What's he talking about?

336
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,510
Head to the hotel, and wait
for Phinks and the others.

337
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,940
If they try to escape, kill them.

338
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,510
Understood.

339
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,240
Now that they're on the alert,

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,520
we have to keep our distance,
or they'll notice us.

341
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,740
Make sure you're concealing your presence.

342
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,770
Damn!

343
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,460
You must be patient.

344
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,630
I understand!

345
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,010
You don't understand!

346
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,390
Your reckless pursuit exposed
them to needless danger.

347
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,020
Do you know why they let
themselves be captured?

348
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,120
If you're caught here,

349
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,420
no one will be able to stop the Troupe!

350
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,530
I'm sorry...

351
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,380
Humans have to lower their
guard at some point.

352
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,780
It's an endurance test.

353
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,850
We must wait.

354
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,360
Yeah.

355
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,380
Where's Squala?

356
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,440
He isn't answering his phone.

357
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,930
It isn't the chain user.

358
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,010
No.

359
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,810
He was on the list.

360
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,590
Get out.

361
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm pretty good at my job.

362
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,810
I've survived some tight spots.

363
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,820
There's a sort of gut instinct that
works only in those times.

364
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,150
And mine tells me that this...

365
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,750
...is where I'll...

366
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,450
If you move an inch, I'll cut you down.

367
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,090
I have a few questions,
so answer them honestly.

368
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,100
One of your fellow bodyguards
uses chains, right?

369
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,090
Where is he now?

370
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,080
What are you talking about?

371
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,590
Who are you people?!

372
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,630
Do you realize that I'm with
the Nostrade Family...

373
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,050
Answer the question.

374
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,930
I'll break your left arm next.

375
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,060
Hey!

376
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,820
I told you not to move.

377
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,810
Stand perfectly still, and answer her questions.

378
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,820
What happened to Uvogin?

379
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,190
I'm talking about the huge man you captured.

380
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,390
What?

381
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,060
He escaped!

382
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,700
I don't know what happened after that!

383
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,580
Where are your fellow bodyguards?

384
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,270
They already went back to the island.

385
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,110
I was on my way back!

386
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,510
You shouldn't lie...

387
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,760
It's the truth.

388
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,460
Why would I lie in this situation?

389
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,480
Let me ask you one more time.

390
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
Where is the chain user?

391
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,730
I don't know who you're talking about.

392
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,340
None of the bodyguards uses chains!

393
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,770
One last question.

394
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,850
Is there someone for whom

395
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,290
you care deeply?

396
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,310
I wouldn't have chosen
this job if there were!

397
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,880
So her name's Eliza...

398
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,130
She's pretty.

399
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,870
If...

400
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,410
If you lay one finger on Eliza—

401
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,960
I warned you not to move...

402
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,390
Twice.

403
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,450
Did you get any data on the chain user?

404
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,480
Naturally.

405
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,360
It's too much trouble to explain,
so I'll shoot the information into you.

406
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,420
With my Memory Bomb.

407
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Recollection Bullet

408
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,120
Recollection Bullet
Memory Bomb

409
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,970
If you're concerned, I'll stop.

410
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,620
Are you stupid? Hurry up.

411
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,480
I see...

412
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,260
So that's what you look like, Kurapika-san.

413
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,900
I won't forget your name
and face until I kill you!

414
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,190
The Phantom Troupe has finally
identified Uvogin's killer.

415
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,870
Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.

416
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,120
The final battle draws near.

417
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

418
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

420
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

421
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

422
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

423
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

424
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

425
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:19,540
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

426
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,250
Today, we introduce Nobunaga.

427
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,660
A Phantom Troupe member.

428
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,630
An Enhancer.

429
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,290
An iaido master, who can use En

430
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,200
An Enhancer.

431
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,160
He likes Gon and Killua,

432
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,320
in a four-meter radius.

433
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,000
He focuses aura in his sword, to strike down foes

434
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,850
and wants to recruit
them into the Troupe.

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
with a single blow.

436
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Single blow?

437
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,870
Low blow!

438
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,390
Next time: Initiative x And x Law.

439
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,140
The keyword is dark adaptation.

440
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,530
Do you know?

441
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,560
Look it up in a dictionary.
