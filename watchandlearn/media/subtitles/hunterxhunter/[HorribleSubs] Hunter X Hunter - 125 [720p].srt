2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,290
Killua...

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,510
I have you to thank.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,970
I've been like this since I woke up.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,590
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,880
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,420
But you must not forget...

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,850
You are the one Gon needs most.

9
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Great Power x And x Ultimate Power

10
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,400
Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,870
miraculously returned Palm to her old self.

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,990
Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,

13
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,270
Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,

14
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,190
appearing before those in the room

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,410
in order to challenge Pouf.

16
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,860
Pouf...

17
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,770
Step outside.

18
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,380
Very well.

19
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,500
I will face you.

20
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,290
But first, I have something to say.

21
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,540
That which stands before you is only a clone.

22
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,050
My true body is already on its way to the King.

23
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,890
Having escaped the cage of smoke,

24
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,560
Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle
and Morel had made contact.

25
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,740
He decided to assume

26
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,990
that his enemies knew of
his ability to create clones,

27
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,660
and to act accordingly.

28
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,590
That was the correct call.

29
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,780
The boss told me that you could make clones.

30
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,660
You're telling the truth.

31
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,250
Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,180
By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted
to gain the mental advantage.

33
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,920
His plan was a success.

34
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,290
But why are you telling me this?

35
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,470
Pouf's concern was Youpi.

36
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,690
Since Knuckle was here,

37
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,390
that meant that Youpi had spared his life

38
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,770
and had not told Pouf this.

39
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,830
Depending on his reason...

40
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,260
Answer me!

41
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,050
To satisfy him.

42
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,310
Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully
so that he could persuade Knuckle

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
to tell him the motive behind the
transformation he'd sensed in Youpi.

44
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,070
I told you in order to satisfy him.

45
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,340
He has demanded that I not leave this room.

46
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,050
If we are to engage in a duel,

47
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,530
I will need him to withdraw his
demand, so that I may leave.

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,720
I am but a clone...

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
I cannot use my wing scales.

50
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,760
However, I am still willing to fight you.

51
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,270
What I seek is a discussion.

52
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,840
That is why I revealed the truth.

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,360
Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who
would call him from behind to challenge him,

54
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,220
appearing to be telling the truth
would be more effective.

55
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,870
You're lying...

56
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,380
You were going to kill me from behind.

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,310
You even admitted it.

58
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,390
Knuckle, don't let him fool you!

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,950
First, you claim to be a clone.

60
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,900
Are you able to prove that?

61
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,900
He's right.

62
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,910
This boy is proving troublesome.

63
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,040
I dare say that, of our enemies,
he possesses the strongest will.

64
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,770
Perhaps I should be pleased

65
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,930
that he is trapped here with Pitou.

66
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,420
Because his strong will keeps him in here.

67
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,070
Were I to prove myself a clone, I would
be placing myself at a disadvantage.

68
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,740
So I can say nothing.

69
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,080
You must use your own judgment.

70
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,680
And...

71
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,280
I shall allow you

72
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,960
to decide what happens next.

73
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,720
Pouf, you can't mean to...

74
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,980
Stop...

75
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,510
I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.

76
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,150
Whether you come or not is your choice!

77
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,270
Please wait...

78
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,290
I'm still here!

79
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,390
I apologize for Pouf's behavior!

80
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,610
I'm the only one you need, right?

81
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,780
Ten minutes.

82
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,290
You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.

83
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,300
Pitou was trembling.

84
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,970
It was disturbing enough that

85
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,470
Pouf had been willing to leave,
despite the consequences.

86
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,230
But what was truly frightening was
how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,

87
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,680
calmly moving up the deadline instead.

88
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,840
How long?

89
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,820
How long do I have to wait?

90
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,830
To completely heal her

91
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,580
will take three to four hours.

92
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,830
No, I can't wait that long.

93
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,840
If I have an hour,

94
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,090
I can heal her most critical injuries.

95
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,130
Originally, to protect Komugi
and heal her completely,

96
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,840
Pitou had deliberately named a longer
time frame than was necessary,

97
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,860
which Gon had denied.

98
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,400
So the hour that they'd agreed
upon was the actual time

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,370
Pitou believed necessary for Komugi
to make a full recovery.

100
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,900
However,

101
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,960
Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.

102
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,260
It may have been possible

103
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,990
to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.

104
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,770
Upon thinking this, Pitou realized...

105
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,750
It may have been mere coincidence,

106
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,500
but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten
minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words.

107
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:33,490
Despite that likelihood, Pitou
could not shake a bad feeling.

108
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,310
I must risk my life.

109
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,660
Or else his fangs

110
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,160
may reach the King's throat!

111
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,790
I understand.

112
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,470
Knuckle.

113
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,360
I'll be fine here alone.

114
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,050
I said that Pouf was lying,

115
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,610
but it's probably true that his main
body is headed for the King.

116
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,060
The King is to the south.

117
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,570
Gon and Killua had seen everything
that had transpired.

118
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,880
But since Pitou did not know that,

119
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,870
it was only natural to assume that Gon

120
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,580
had seen through Pouf's plans.

121
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,780
Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.

122
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,300
Pitou was now fully resolved to
complete the mission at hand.

123
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,290
I must kill him.

124
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,110
No matter the cost!

125
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,890
I must kill him...

126
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,670
For the King's sake!

127
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,860
Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?

128
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,460
No, that won't work.

129
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,750
I can't expose her to danger.

130
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,060
First, I must entrust her to someone else.

131
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,430
Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.

132
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,110
This won't do.

133
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,130
If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?

134
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,400
Gon,

135
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,550
I understand what you're saying.

136
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,290
However...

137
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,110
I will still do things my way.

138
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,620
Youpi is...

139
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,960
No, never mind.

140
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,970
If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,

141
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,880
it could result in his death.

142
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,340
See ya.

143
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,830
Knuckle managed to stop himself.

144
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,450
How would you know my name?

145
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,050
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

146
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,330
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

147
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,540
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

148
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,680
Interested in fighting me now?

149
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,850
If you can force me to admit defeat,

150
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,290
I will tell you your name.

151
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,480
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?

152
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,910
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

153
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,070
No matter.

154
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,280
I shall checkmate you shortly.

155
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
As the King moved into his stance,

156
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,030
Netero took to the air.

157
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,960
When was it...

158
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,480
that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?

159
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
Whenever you're ready,

160
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,220
come at me.

161
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,270
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...

162
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,770
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva

163
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,960
Ninety-ninth Hand

164
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,160
Ninety-ninth Hand!

165
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,440
When was it

166
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,020
that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,

167
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,510
taking the hands of vanquished opponents

168
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,300
when they bowed their heads in defeat?

169
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,970
That cannot be

170
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,590
the ultimate power I sought!

171
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,670
It is fighting with all my soul against

172
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,980
an opponent with the strength to defeat me!

173
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,010
This is a tomb.

174
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,380
Your tomb.

175
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,610
I am very thankful.

176
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,460
Thankful for everything

177
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,760
that has made our meeting possible!

178
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,920
Next time: Zero x And x Rose.

179
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,120
We haven't seen each other in a while.

180
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,800
Yeah.

181
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,830
But it feels like you were always with me.

182
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,800
Yeah.

183
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,630
The future is ours.
