2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,980
Kite is alive!

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,410
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,150
So we should hurry back...

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,870
Once we're stronger.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,070
To save Kite!

7
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,990
Promise x and x Reunion

8
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,460
Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.

9
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,790
But before they can return to NGL,

10
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,110
they must pass the condition
set by Chairman Netero,

11
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,470
leader of the punitive force.

12
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,970
What are those?

13
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,750
Tokens.

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,900
You take a piece of marked wood and split it,

15
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,980
giving each half to a different person.

16
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,780
They work as proof that you're an ally

17
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,480
or to authenticate a document.

18
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,990
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,990
In this case,

20
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,800
each of the two assassins
holds one matching token.

21
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,710
We defeat them and take the tokens.

22
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,010
It's been erased.

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,660
That means someone checked the board.

24
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,020
Yeah.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,040
You must be Killua and Gon.

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,400
Nice to meet you.

27
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,780
My name is Palm.

28
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,040
It's a pleasure.

29
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,020
Oh, dear...

30
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,470
No need to be so tense.

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,010
I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,440
Allow me to explain.

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,290
Why don't we have some tea?

34
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,060
I am a student of Knov-sensei.

35
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,420
He said I would only get in his way...

36
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,270
But I insisted on accompanying him.

37
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,330
Who's that?

38
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,250
She probably means one of the
guys with Chairman Netero.

39
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,820
Yes, the one wearing a black suit...

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,050
My teacher is an incredible person.

41
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,120
Cool, intelligent, composed...

42
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,090
Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!

43
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,120
Oh, dear...

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,790
Oh, but I only respect him, that's all.

45
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,210
There's nothing romantic about my feelings...

46
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,600
At least, I may wish that were the case.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,240
After all, when it comes to falling
in love, respect is a major factor.

48
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,590
Ah, my teacher knows nothing
about this, of course.

49
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,240
I haven't said a word to him,
and I don't intend to.

50
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,540
No one can say what will happen...

51
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,750
After all, love is a spontaneous thing,

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,980
don't you agree?

53
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,080
Uh, can I interrupt you?

54
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,660
Aren't we supposed to fight you?

55
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,010
Huh? Oh, dear...

56
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,050
Yes, I apologize.

57
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,330
The Chairman and my teacher

58
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,360
said I couldn't accompany them any farther.

59
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,010
But I insisted on going with them.

60
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,230
It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying
to convince them of my determination.

61
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,890
And finally, they relented, with one condition.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,190
Uh, I'm asking about...

63
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,730
My teacher may appear a cold person,

64
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,490
but he's actually quite gentle.

65
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,630
But you have to spend a lot of
time with him to realize that.

66
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,450
Ah, by "spending time with him," I don't mean—

67
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,630
Okay! What's the condition?!

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,210
Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,270
To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats

70
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,520
will be allowed inside NGL before me...

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,640
I cannot allow that.

72
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Palm-san, turn off your Hatsu!

73
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,040
She's an Enhancer like me.

74
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,670
I'm not too happy about that.

75
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,460
Knuckle and Shoot?

76
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,720
Not us?

77
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
That's right.

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,080
After all, I'm not the one who's
supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot.

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,000
You two are.

80
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.

81
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,330
They, too, received a condition.

82
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,510
I don't know what that condition was...

83
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,520
But whether it's us or them, only one
group will be allowed into NGL.

84
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,020
The deadline is one month.

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Since we were told to keep
these tokens for a month,

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,710
that means someone will come for them.

87
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,290
What do we do, Knuckle?

88
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,290
That's easy.

89
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,170
He who strikes first, wins!

90
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,760
Find 'em...

91
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,610
And kill 'em!

92
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,430
Certain Death

93
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,930
My name is Knuckle Bine!

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,310
I am a Beast Hunter!

95
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,080
I challenge the two punitive
force candidates to a duel!

96
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,080
Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!

97
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:12,950
Bring it on

98
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,750
I won't try to run or hide.

99
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,220
I won't bring any weapons or allies.

100
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,300
It'll just be me and me alone.

101
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,990
So come and fight me!

102
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,830
But where?

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,580
The location?

104
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,580
You have to tell them where to find you.

105
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:33,840
Bring it on

106
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,430
A man never turns his back on an enemy.

107
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,090
I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...

108
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,460
You won't get away!

109
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,840
Even if he said where, I wouldn't go.

110
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,390
He's just a decoy.

111
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,720
His partner's probably hidden
somewhere, watching.

112
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,240
They're watching to see if
anyone reacts suspiciously.

113
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,170
According to Palm, they don't
even know our names.

114
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,110
Yeah.

115
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,150
So their goal must be to smoke us out.

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,020
No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.

117
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,740
Did he look strong?

118
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,750
He's pretty strong.

119
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,400
What will it take to defeat him?

120
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,250
I have no idea!

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,990
One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that

122
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,670
In a Nen battle, nothing is certain.

123
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,320
So, according to him,

124
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,620
it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won.

125
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,960
I disagree.

126
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,420
If you want to survive, you must
increase your odds of victory.

127
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,780
Gauging the strength differential between
you and an opponent is crucial.

128
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,070
If you're up against someone you can only beat

129
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,820
once or twice out of a
hundred times, don't bother.

130
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,660
You need at least a fifty-percent chance.

131
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,800
If possible, greater than
seventy percent is preferable.

132
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,920
To reach that, we must do two things...

133
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,890
Work on our fundamentals, and learn
more about our opponents' abilities.

134
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,800
Right.

135
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,930
If we know our opponents' abilities,
it'll be easier to plan ahead.

136
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,420
Like we did against Genthru.

137
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,440
I'm half agreed, and half opposed.

138
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,690
What do you mean?

139
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,700
I think we should work on our fundamentals,

140
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,950
but I don't think we need to know their abilities.

141
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,400
Huh? Why not?

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,820
That just increases our risk of defeat.

143
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,450
Nothing good can come of that!

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,960
But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.

145
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,730
Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...

146
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,260
It's to become stronger,
and return to NGL and save Kite.

147
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,730
In other words,

148
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,270
we must be strong enough to defeat
enemies we know nothing about.

149
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,920
Winning here with advance
preparation is pointless.

150
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,150
That's true,

151
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,860
but we have to defeat these opponents first.

152
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,010
After all, we only have a month.

153
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
That's too long.

154
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,450
One week.

155
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,290
In one week, we'll be stronger,
and heading back to NGL!

156
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,490
Go—

157
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,750
Are you an idiot?!

158
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,040
Bisky!

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,910
Why are you here?

160
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,010
I asked her to come.

161
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,420
Huh? You know each other?

162
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,290
No, I looked into your backgrounds.

163
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,490
How?

164
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,900
We only know Bisky because...

165
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,000
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,430
Now, there's no time to spare.

167
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,400
Let's begin...

168
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,300
The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.

169
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,740
Um, no.

170
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,600
Let's get started, then.

171
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,420
Osu!

172
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,490
What was that for?!

173
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,940
I'm picking up where I left off.

174
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,300
Are you stupid?

175
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,430
That old man's famous for his nasty nature.

176
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,900
If he tells you to do something in a month,

177
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,670
it probably should take an entire year.

178
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,190
You won't defeat them after a week!

179
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,180
But we have to hurry back and save Kite.

180
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,070
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,790
That was fun...

182
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,720
Like a dream come true.

183
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,510
I'd love to fight you...

184
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,950
once more.

185
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,570
I see...

186
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,180
All the more reason you shouldn't
return without proper training!

187
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,060
What if you make the same mistake again?!

188
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,940
So typical of her age.

189
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,990
She's always ready with a lecture.

190
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,990
Got it?

191
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,540
Osu...

192
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,640
Let's start training, then.

193
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,210
Begin with Ren!

194
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,630
Maintain that for three hours.

195
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,120
Killua, how long can you last?

196
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,890
In top condition, I can manage
around fifty-five minutes, max.

197
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,770
Until you complete this,
we can't move to the next step.

198
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,190
Train like your lives are on the line!

199
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,820
Come on.

200
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,120
You didn't even last an hour.

201
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,290
Okay, keep working.

202
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,060
They say it takes a month to add ten
minutes to your Ren endurance.

203
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,050
You won't have time to sleep.

204
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,810
Curses...

205
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,050
Those damn cowards ran away!

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,440
You bastards deserve to die now!

207
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,470
You have a collar.

208
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,440
Where's your owner?

209
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,590
You're supposed to keep the park clean.

210
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,840
Okay, you can rest for today!

211
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,460
Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.

212
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,540
Looks like it's time for me to use my power.

213
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,500
Take it away, Cookie-chan.

214
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,650
Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.

215
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
Pink Relief

216
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,620
Excuse me...

217
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,470
I hope this won't offend you,

218
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,180
but I'll let you decide how to train them.

219
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,020
Since my power told me that
you would be the answer.

220
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,050
However,

221
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:50,400
if they cannot defeat Morel's
disciples after one month,

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,000
I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,610
I absolutely must go to NGL.

224
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,840
Honestly, I want to depart this moment.

225
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,040
So after I've waited and waited
and waited and waited and waited,

226
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,550
if this fails now,

227
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,800
I'll probably kill all of you...

228
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,310
Was that a threat?

229
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,780
No, it's a warning.

230
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,220
I'm worried about you all.

231
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,310
So if you think they have no chance,
I recommend that you leave...

232
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,730
Speaking from experience, I'm less
likely to lose my temper that way.

233
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,350
I'm not the one you should tell.

234
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,820
Once they're awake, tell the boys.

235
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,340
Don't worry! We've got this!

236
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,580
You can count on us to get you to NGL.

237
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,750
So let us know if you notice anything.

238
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,120
We'll do our best.

239
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,670
That's how they are.

240
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,100
Have some faith.

241
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,400
Oh, dear!

242
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,490
This won't do at all...

243
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,430
Anyway, I'm more concerned about
what's happening inside NGL.

244
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,140
What is the Chairman's group
doing for the next month?

245
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,740
Well?!

246
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,250
Ah, well...

247
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,450
They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.

248
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,250
Identifying the enemy's strengths,
and weakening their forces...

249
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,200
The experts can't agree on the amount of time

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,870
remaining before the King's birth.

251
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,270
The Chairman is operating with two months,

252
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,290
the earliest prediction, as the deadline.

253
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,230
This is bad.

254
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,530
That thing is stronger than I am.

255
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,800
Stronger than the Chairman?

256
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,410
Surely you jest.

257
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,420
If that's really true,

258
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,640
none of the Hunters will be able to fight it.

259
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:08,270
It's been more than half a century since
I was the strongest among Nen users.

260
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,050
Now, I'm more or less even with you guys.

261
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,010
Then you're more than strong enough.

262
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
You should have more confidence.

263
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,010
Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?

264
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,170
Growing old is no fun.

265
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,180
He never stops talking.

266
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,810
But we must fight.

267
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,470
I would prefer to avoid it...

268
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,310
If there were a solution that would
avoid a fight, I'd choose it.

269
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,260
Our target is the Queen,
and the Queen alone.

270
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,960
But sneaking past the surveillance of
that En will be next to impossible.

271
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,530
We cannot avoid a fight...

272
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,980
The question is how we will manage to win.

273
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,590
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.

274
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,540
You're simply awful.

275
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,670
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?

276
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,450
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.

277
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,050
Yeah, let's take it slow.

278
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,260
Might as well enjoy the job...

279
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,270
Okay...

280
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,070
First, we should learn the enemy's numbers.

281
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,440
Go.

282
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,300
So many.

283
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,290
Something is coming.

284
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,580
They aren't alive...

285
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,070
Is this the enemy's power?

286
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,210
Now, what to do?

287
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,420
You may as well wait.

288
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,720
If they come here, we simply destroy them.

289
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,450
You have a point.

290
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,430
These could be decoys.

291
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,760
Huh, what?

292
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,730
Was I speaking aloud?

293
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,150
No.

294
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,480
I simply knew what you were thinking.

295
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,980
Who are you, anyway?

296
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,000
One of the Queen's Royal Guard.

297
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,460
Shaiapouf.

298
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,500
Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.

299
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,780
Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.

300
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,380
Yes, that is correct.

301
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,410
You can read all my thoughts.

302
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,720
Not sure I like that.

303
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Well, I can understand the sentiment.

304
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,330
But...

305
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,050
He will wake soon.

306
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,650
That's good news!

307
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:24,020
You see, I haven't been able to
decide what power to develop.

308
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,720
Right, it's so simple.

309
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,700
I merely need to fix him.

310
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,710
I only need the power to do that.

311
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,930
And then, I will be able to experience
that dreamlike moment with you

312
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,390
once more...

313
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,950
Come on, what are you doing?

314
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,120
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.

315
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,160
Are you giving up on going to NGL?

316
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,130
N-No way...

317
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,660
We never give up.

318
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,110
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!

319
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,890
To save Kite...

320
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,970
After reuniting with Bisky,

321
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,380
Gon and Killua are back to training.

322
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,500
They have one goal:

323
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
to get strong enough to save Kite.

324
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,780
Right now, that motivation is driving Gon.

325
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,050
Next time: Duel x and x Escape.

326
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,170
It's on, Killua!

327
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,490
It's on, Gon!

328
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,800
Rock, paper... Rock!

329
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,680
I lost...
