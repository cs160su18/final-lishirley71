2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,450
I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,950
Which group do you belong to?

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,760
We're bodyguards for
the Nostrade Family.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,460
I see.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,460
It seems that you can use Nen,

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,080
but don't bother.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,470
These aren't ordinary thugs.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,720
To them, taking lives is like breathing.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,520
Y-You could say they're
professional killers.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,350
And a pro knows his trade best of all.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,730
Rabid Dog.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,230
I'm Leech.

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,780
I-I'm Porcupine.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,040
We Shadow Beasts will see to them.

16
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,040
Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle

17
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,180
After the Phantom Troupe's
raid on the auction,

18
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,950
Uvogin has single-handedly
annihilated the Mafia pursuit.

19
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,470
Now, they watch the arrival

20
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,480
of the secret weapon dispatched
by the Mafia's Ten Dons,

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,330
the Shadow Beasts.

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,490
Man...

23
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,030
Not one of them put up much of a fight.

24
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,830
Uvo!

25
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,790
Yeah?

26
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,110
Here they come.

27
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,120
Hey, don't interfere.

28
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,560
I still haven't gotten to enjoy myself.

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,540
Jeez...

30
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,070
Let Uvo handle it.

31
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,570
Care for a round, Feitan?

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,000
He's going to fight the
Shadow Beasts by himself?

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
The Shadow Beasts, huh?

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,570
Where did you hide the merchandise?

35
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,100
What happened to all the
guards and guests?

36
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,620
We killed them.

37
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,100
So where's the merchandise?

38
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,610
If you don't answer me...

39
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,050
That stung.

40
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,900
Now you can't escape...

41
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,750
Make your choice.

42
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,270
Do you want to die
underground, at my hands?

43
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,730
Or on the surface, at the
hands of the other three?

44
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,720
Idiot.

45
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,550
Here he goes.

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,050
Uvo's getting serious...

47
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,170
Four.

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,930
You're the one

49
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,930
who can't escape!

50
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,960
Big Bang Impact:
Fist of Destruction

51
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,570
I-I don't believe it!

52
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,910
I've never seen a Nen user
of this caliber before.

53
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,360
That's...

54
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,240
A spider tattoo.

55
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,060
Then he's...

56
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,390
Spider...

57
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,530
Poor chap.
Not much left of him.

58
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,360
Uvo's Big Bang Impact
packs a powerful punch.

59
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,280
Honestly...

60
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,030
He's just throwing a straight right,
with a little added Nen.

61
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,360
Eight.

62
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,580
Nine.

63
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,630
Ten.

64
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,540
Okay, who's dying next?

65
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,710
The Phantom Troupe, huh?

66
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,480
He sounds pretty confident.

67
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,980
You're the one who will die next!

68
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,640
Fool.

69
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,630
Nice...

70
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,510
I like reckless opponents.

71
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,970
But you're still going to die!

72
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,330
I can manipulate my body hair at will.

73
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,230
I can even turn it into hard spikes, yup.

74
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,130
You throw a strong punch,

75
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,490
but it's meaningless if
you can't connect, yup.

76
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,760
They managed to damage

77
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,550
Uvogin's iron skin with nothing
but body hair and teeth.

78
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,880
Must be skilled Nen users.

79
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,450
I'm impressed.

80
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,460
Thirteen.

81
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,610
No way!

82
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,900
Sorry.

83
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,130
Want a hand, Uvo?

84
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,140
Keep out of this!

85
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,660
Damn it...

86
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,900
It's futile.

87
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,650
You can't shake off thousands of spikes

88
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,530
once they've penetrated your skin, yup.

89
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,380
Then I'll use you as my fist!

90
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,280
Since I can manipulate it at will,

91
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,000
I can relax certain sections of
my body hair as necessary, yup.

92
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,360
We've got Muscles on the ropes.

93
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,130
That's bull.

94
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
You're damned tough.

95
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,730
Did it finally kick in?

96
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,240
My fangs secrete a tranquilizer

97
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,980
that's meant to instantly incapacitate you...

98
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,580
Bastard...

99
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,600
Everything from the neck up is unaffected,

100
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,120
so you can still feel pain and fear.

101
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,950
So sit back and enjoy.

102
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,960
If he were using a lethal poison,
this fight would be over.

103
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,710
I'm sure he likes to torture opponents.

104
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,520
I keep numerous leeches
of all sizes within me...

105
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,990
They'll enter your body
through your wounds,

106
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,730
and deposit their eggs in your bladder.

107
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,730
These spotted leeches are
a gift from me to you.

108
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,660
You're totally disgusting!

109
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,190
Most people die from the
excruciating pain

110
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,050
of hundreds of millions of leeches

111
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,730
as they hatch inside their bodies.

112
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,200
Yuck.

113
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,630
I thought that uglier usually
meant better-tasting.

114
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,240
Why are you surprised?

115
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,980
You aren't the only one
who can use his teeth.

116
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,490
Everything from my neck up
is all I need to defeat you.

117
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,310
They're going to lose...

118
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,830
The Shadow Beasts will lose.

119
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,540
They're going to lose...

120
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,030
The Shadow Beasts will lose.

121
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,240
Defeat us?

122
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,610
Heh.

123
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,090
You can't bite me when I'm
all the way over here.

124
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,830
A bullet?

125
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,630
No...

126
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,990
It's a fragment of Leech's
skull that he bit off!

127
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,460
He's going to do the same to me?

128
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,030
But it won't work...

129
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,040
My body hair will repel
any projectile, yup.

130
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,160
Huh?

131
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,220
You can't repel sound projectiles, can you?

132
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,910
Oh, you can't hear me anymore?

133
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,800
He used sound to defeat
a Shadow Beast.

134
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
They're all crazy...

135
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,560
You idiot!

136
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,040
Give us a warning first!

137
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,330
What if our eardrums had burst?

138
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,810
Sorry about that!

139
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,890
But that would've given my plan away.

140
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,680
Besides, you guys had plenty
of time to cover your ears

141
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,910
before the sound reached you.

142
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,240
That's true.

143
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,950
Wait, Kurapika!

144
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,390
What are you doing?

145
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,220
Shouldn't that be obvious?

146
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm going to capture him.

147
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,610
It's impossible!

148
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,780
You saw what he's capable of!

149
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,850
You're going to get yourself killed!

150
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,090
Kurapika!

151
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,390
I really don't care.

152
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,700
I hear tremendous rage and hatred.

153
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,290
He's completely lost control.

154
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,610
Kurapika!

155
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,620
He will definitely get himself killed.

156
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,120
I cannot leave him in this state.

157
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
Stop, Kurapika!

158
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,480
Wild Flower.

159
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,870
The perfect song to relax you.

160
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,740
Has everyone calmed down?

161
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,620
Let's cool our heads,

162
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,340
and devise a plan together.

163
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,620
Y-Yeah...

164
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,770
What kind of abilities do the
other members possess?

165
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,080
I bet they're all ridiculously strong...

166
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,900
Melody...

167
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,630
Hmm?

168
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,500
Thank you.

169
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,890
I've cooled down now.

170
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,160
However, I still must capture them.

171
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,610
Leader,

172
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,490
I can make this happen.

173
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,650
What?

174
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,580
Let me go.

175
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,660
After witnessing that
incredible show of strength,

176
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,110
you still believe you can defeat him?

177
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,660
Of course.

178
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,970
I understand.

179
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,240
Bring the car, so we can
leave at a moment's notice.

180
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,050
R-Right.

181
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,350
Shizuku!

182
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,190
Would you suck the poison and
leeches from my body?

183
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,410
Your vacuum will do the trick.

184
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,200
Blinky can suck out poison,
but nothing alive.

185
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,310
What?

186
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,380
Then what am I supposed to do?

187
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,860
Let me see.

188
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,810
This is a spotted leech...

189
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,750
It takes one day to migrate to the bladder,

190
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,950
before laying its eggs and dying.

191
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,650
So?

192
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,680
The eggs will hatch shortly after,
exiting through your urinary tract.

193
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,320
It will cause enough pain to kill you.

194
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,210
Hey, don't joke around...

195
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,740
However, they require a specific
ammonia level to hatch.

196
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,340
If there isn't enough,

197
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,220
the eggs don't hatch, and they
can be excreted harmlessly.

198
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,940
So, until this time tomorrow,

199
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,710
you should drink beer non-stop,
and be sure to urinate frequently!

200
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,850
Don't scare me like that...

201
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,010
Shizuku, can you take care of the poison?

202
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,990
Yes.

203
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,780
Someone go to the city
and get lots of beer.

204
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,990
I'll go.

205
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,540
Make sure they're ice-cold!

206
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,870
Don't get too greedy!

207
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,430
Okay, get that poison out of me.

208
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,130
Huh?

209
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,030
Did you see that?

210
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,150
Yeah.

211
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,330
Those chains came from nowhere,
to wrap around his body.

212
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,360
Is it a new Shadow Beast?

213
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,240
Uvo can't move because of the tranquilizer,

214
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,570
and the leeches are still inside him.

215
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,840
Then that's that...
Let's go and save him.

216
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,330
Good grief.

217
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,770
He's so much trouble.

218
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,340
I have a trace for now.

219
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,720
I used In to conceal the thread.

220
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,980
So as long as they don't use
Gyo to spot the needle,

221
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,850
I can follow them anywhere.

222
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,100
Okay, let's find them
before they notice it.

223
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,360
This is our chance to finish the
remaining Shadow Beasts.

224
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,420
Franklin, we're counting on you
to bring back lots of beer.

225
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,500
Man, the chase sounds more fun...

226
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,370
Let's go!

227
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,870
Indeed.

228
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,010
The spiders...

229
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,880
We'd need all the remaining members

230
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,530
just to stand a chance...

231
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,310
Understood.

232
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,590
Chains...

233
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,460
Hey, driver...

234
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,940
You think these chains can hold me?

235
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,300
If you don't kill me now,
you'll regret it later.

236
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,420
Shut up.

237
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,380
Don't you understand?

238
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,930
This is a golden opportunity.

239
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,430
Stop wasting time, and just...

240
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,320
I told you to shut up!

241
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Kurapika, watch...

242
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,410
Watch the road!

243
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,820
How can he be this strong?

244
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,840
Even if my body weren't paralyzed,
I'd still be having trouble...

245
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,360
He's put enough Nen into these chains

246
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,490
to keep a master Enhancer in check?

247
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,840
Chain Jail.

248
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,350
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger

249
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,730
This power can only be used on the spiders...

250
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,280
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.

251
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,490
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.

252
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,490
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique

253
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:14,290
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.

254
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,750
A self-imposed restriction.

255
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,810
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.

256
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:25,260
A self-imposed restriction.
A covenant with myself.

257
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
The proof of my resolve.

258
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,880
Look out, Kurapika...

259
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,340
The risk is high.

260
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,180
Watch the road!

261
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,270
But the stronger my resolve,

262
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,730
the stronger my Nen!

263
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,910
Kurapika has captured a member

264
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,030
of the Phantom Troupe, his sworn enemies.

265
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,670
Armed with resolve and the
willingness to risk his life,

266
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,250
an intense battle is about to begin.

267
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

268
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,280
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

269
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

270
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

271
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

272
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

273
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

274
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

275
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:20,420
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

276
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,240
Today, we introduce the Shadow Beasts.

277
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,740
A fighting force formed
by the Ten Dons.

278
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,110
A fighting force serving the Mafia community's

279
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,580
There are ten members,

280
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,180
Ten Dons.

281
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,580
So who are they?

282
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,150
all named after
animals and insects.

283
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,170
Owl, Worm, Rabid Dog, Porcupine...

284
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,620
And Leech—

285
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,010
Next time: Restraint x And x Vow!

286
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,410
Killua, don't run in the hallway.

287
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,240
Limbatics counts as walking.

288
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,310
Promise to follow the rules!
