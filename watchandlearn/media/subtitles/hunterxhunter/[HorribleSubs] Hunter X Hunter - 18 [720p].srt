00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,260
Leorio!

10
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,790
Leorio!

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,650
Big x Time x Interview

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,660
Gon's group has been trapped by
the vipers that block the exit.

13
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,030
But the vipers' master, Bourbon,

14
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,150
is already dead.

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,470
The one who set this trap is dead?

16
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,420
How?

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,420
I killed him.

18
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,920
I won't tell you how.

19
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,170
Gon, take Leorio.

20
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,990
Okay.

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,220
It's no use.

22
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,700
You won't be able to search his body.

23
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,170
The snakes are trained to attack

24
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,960
the moment anyone tries to touch
their master or to leave the cave.

25
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,710
So you used poison to fight poison.

26
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,040
Judging from his wounds,

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,220
you must have used Neurotoxic Bees.

28
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,220
He probably died from anaphylactic shock.

29
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,980
Anaphylactic shock?

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,900
When a bee stings a human,

31
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,690
the human produces antibodies
to counter the venom.

32
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,500
But if that human is stung again
by the same kind of bee,

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,240
they experience an allergic reaction.

34
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,110
An extreme allergic reaction

35
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,010
is known as anaphylactic shock.

36
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,460
Depending on the circumstances,
it can be fatal.

37
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,830
You got me.
That's exactly what happened.

38
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,000
So you used bees to kill him?

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Bourbon was my target.

40
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,040
After confirming that he'd
entered the cave,

41
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,770
I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance,

42
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,760
and waited until it was safe to enter.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,110
Bourbon was sound asleep,

44
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,000
but he'd already set his trap.

45
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,800
The sleeping gas didn't reach

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,850
most of the snakes that were hiding

47
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,980
in cracks at the back of the cave.

48
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,870
Well, I jumped back in time,

49
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,940
so I wasn't bitten by snakes.

50
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,940
But that triggered my attack switch.

51
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,950
You keep bees up there?

52
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,910
If I scream or collapse,

53
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,700
they'll attack any nearby humans.

54
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,720
I didn't expect him to die.

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,710
How could I have known that he'd
already been stung once?

56
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,960
And I couldn't help him
because of the snakes.

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,110
Well, it was beyond my control anyway.

58
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,680
You can come back now.

59
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,700
The problem is that he's dead,

60
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,030
but the viper trap is still active.

61
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,490
And we can't ask him or
look for a way to disarm it.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,350
We're trapped with no escape.

63
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,490
Leorio...

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,310
I've already given up.

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,040
We just have to wait for the
examiners to come and save us.

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,460
The examiners?

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,500
You're saying that they'll
rescue us from this cave?

68
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,630
You didn't know?

69
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,360
Our ID tags contain a tracking device.

70
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,150
The examiners can locate each applicant.

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,650
If someone hasn't returned
by the deadline,

72
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,770
the examiners will look for them.

73
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,350
Though this won't work if
you lose your tag

74
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,060
or if someone takes it from you.

75
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,200
Fortunately, there's only one day left.

76
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,600
The best course would be to give up
for this year and wait for help.

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
We cannot do that.

78
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,700
Leorio's condition is worsening.

79
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,410
We must take him to a
doctor immediately.

80
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,160
The examiners won't move until
the deadline passes.

81
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,420
If you don't have your tag,
you'll basically be left for dead.

82
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,850
It's his own fault.

83
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,420
I warned him.

84
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,810
Kurapika! Gon!

85
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,960
Don't come in! The snakes...!

86
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,450
All you can do is pray that he
holds out until help arrives.

87
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,620
No, there is still a way.

88
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,590
With a good chance for success.

89
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,050
But if he isn't carrying any on his person,

90
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,770
we'll have another victim.

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,700
Kurapika.

92
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,470
Look after Leorio.

93
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,200
Gon?

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm sure we'll find some!

95
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,580
Gon...

96
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,080
Hey, Gon!

97
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,710
Wait, what are you doing?

98
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,460
Didn't you hear what I just said?

99
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,490
Hello?

100
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,430
Gon!

101
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,940
H-He's crazy...

102
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,390
Found it!

103
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,600
Kurapika!

104
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,620
Gon!

105
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,320
Use it on Leorio quick...

106
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,020
All right, you're next.

107
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,310
Yeah...

108
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,440
I don't believe it...

109
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,270
He jumped into a nest of
poisonous snakes

110
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,060
to search for an antidote,
not even knowing if he had it?

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,710
The odds were in his favor.

112
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,320
What?

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,590
If you're going to poison someone,

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,080
you'd need the antidote at hand,
as a bargaining chip.

115
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,030
That's true, but...

116
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,580
That said,

117
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,910
it took an incredible amount of courage

118
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,080
to do what he just did.

119
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,090
Leorio's condition is stabilizing.

120
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,220
He should be fine.

121
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,330
You must be really good friends.

122
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,060
Hey, do you have any sleeping gas left?

123
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,120
I do...

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
Would you trade it for this?

125
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,560
Ah!

126
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,540
That's Bourbon's!

127
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,320
This gives you six points, right?

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,230
Yes, that's right.

129
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,180
But what are you going to do
with the sleeping gas?

130
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,950
Put all the snakes to sleep,
so we can escape.

131
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,710
It'd be more effective than when
I sprayed the gas from outside.

132
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,710
Within five minutes, the entire
cave will fill with gas,

133
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,210
and the snakes will be asleep.

134
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,280
But it'll take five minutes!

135
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,090
No one can hold their breath that long.

136
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,520
There's no point if we put
ourselves to sleep in the process.

137
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,610
Nine minutes and forty-four seconds.

138
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,220
Huh?

139
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,360
That's my record.

140
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,500
I'll hold my breath and carry
everyone out of here.

141
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,220
I can't trust you.

142
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,960
You might escape by yourself.

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,850
You really think he'd do that,
after jumping into

144
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,830
a nest of poisonous snakes to save Leorio?

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,860
Trust me.

146
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,330
I'll get you out of here!

147
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,320
It's ready.

148
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
On my signal, release the gas.

149
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,510
Got it.

150
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,780
199, 200,

151
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,790
201, 202, 203,

152
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,790
204, 205, 206, 207...

153
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,580
Yes!

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,190
Well, I'll leave Bourbon's tag with you,

155
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,450
so the examiners will find you.

156
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,570
If I give Leorio your tag,

157
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,450
he'll have six points and pass.

158
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,580
Consider it the fee for carrying
you out of there.

159
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,770
Sorry.

160
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,430
The Fourth Phase of the exam
has just ended.

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,690
Will the applicants please return

162
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,560
to the starting point at once?

163
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,980
You will be given one hour of extra time.

164
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,570
If you do not return during this time,
you will fail the exam.

165
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,700
Furthermore, you are not allowed
to exchange tags

166
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,630
after reaching the starting point.

167
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,870
Anyone caught swapping tags
will be disqualified.

168
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:18,170
Hunter Vocabulary

169
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,170
Ponzu

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,100
Then we will now check the
tags of everyone here!

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,920
#44 Hisoka-san.

172
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,950
#53, Pokkle-san.

173
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,950
#99, Killua-san.

174
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,960
#301, Gittarackur-san.

175
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,220
#191, Bodoro-san.

176
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,700
#294, Hanzo-san.

177
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,420
So six applicants have passed?

178
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,080
Oh?

179
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,700
Gon.

180
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,090
Ah, three more arrive at the last second.

181
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,590
Killua.

182
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,100
And now for the last few members...

183
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,980
#404, Kurapika-san.

184
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,540
#403, Leorio-san.

185
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,700
And #405, Gon-san.

186
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,440
These nine applicants have passed

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,520
the Fourth Phase of the exam!

188
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,780
Six of the nine are rookies?

189
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,380
Marvelous, marvelous.

190
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,380
Has this ever happened before?

191
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,690
Hmm, there's a trend where

192
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,740
we'll go many years without
a single rookie qualifying.

193
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,030
Then suddenly,

194
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,350
we'll have a whole bunch
of promising newbies.

195
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,240
This is the fourth time I've seen it happen.

196
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,530
By the way, what are we doing
for the Final Phase?

197
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,410
Oh, right.

198
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,980
You haven't told us yet.

199
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,910
Yes, about that...

200
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,660
I intend to have them participate
in a rather peculiar fight.

201
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,540
Hmm? A rather peculiar fight?

202
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,810
First, I want to talk to each of the

203
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,970
nine remaining applicants.

204
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,330
Pathetic...

205
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,560
I needed the two of you

206
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,370
to do everything for me during
the Fourth Phase.

207
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,700
I promise I'll return the favor.

208
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,490
So...

209
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,820
Thanks.

210
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,440
I have an announcement for all applicants.

211
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,560
The chairman wishes to interview
the remaining candidates.

212
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,670
Interview?

213
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,370
When your number is called,

214
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,570
please come to the first reception room,
on the second floor.

215
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,440
Then we will start with #44, Hisoka-sama.

216
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,090
Well, have a seat.

217
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't tell me that this is
the exam's Final Phase.

218
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,550
It may be related...

219
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,410
I'll just be asking a few questions
to satisfy my curiosity.

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,320
First, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

221
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,810
I'm not particularly interested in
becoming a Hunter, but...

222
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,860
But?

223
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,620
A Hunter License can be very useful.

224
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,550
Oh, any examples?

225
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,750
For example,

226
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,620
Hunters usually can't be punished
when they kill someone.

227
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,490
I see.

228
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,630
Then I'll move on to the next question.

229
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,240
Which of the other eight applicants

230
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,380
are you keeping an eye on?

231
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,010
#99.

232
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,260
Ah...

233
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,190
#405 is also on my radar,

234
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,860
but it's #99 I'm keeping an eye on.

235
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,400
I would love to take him on one day.

236
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,680
One last question.

237
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,030
Which of the other eight applicants
would you least want to fight?

238
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,710
That would be #405.

239
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,980
Though #99 is also up there.

240
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,950
If you're asking whom I least
want to fight at this moment,

241
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,920
my answer would be #405.

242
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,290
Ah, I understand.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,600
I should mention that the one I most
want to fight at this moment

244
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,270
is you.

245
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,750
Yep, nice job.

246
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,560
You're excused.

247
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,070
That old man is too crafty...

248
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,320
He left himself so undefended,
I lost my edge.

249
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm watching out for #404.

250
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,670
He looks to be the most
balanced applicant left.

251
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,830
I definitely don't want to fight #44.

252
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,920
To be honest, I doubt I can beat him.

253
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,280
Has to be Gon.
Since we're the same age.

254
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,240
I don't want to fight #53.

255
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,350
I don't think it'd be a
very interesting fight.

256
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,650
I've got my eye on #44.

257
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,570
He has real presence.

258
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,960
#405 and #99 are still children.

259
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,950
I couldn't bring myself to fight them.

260
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,210
#99.

261
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,370
#44.

262
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,650
Who am I watching out for?

263
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,680
#44, Hisoka.

264
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,770
A lot's happened, so I've
been watching him.

265
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,220
I can't choose one out of
#99, #403, and #404.

266
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,990
It has to be #44.

267
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,440
He's the most dangerous one here.

268
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,650
And #44 is the one I least want to fight.

269
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm watching #405 for positive reasons,

270
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,420
and #44 for negative reasons.

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,420
If I'm given ample reason,
I'll fight anyone.

272
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,830
If not, I would prefer not to fight anyone.

273
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
#405.

274
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,940
I owe him, and I hope that
he passes the exam.

275
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,550
So I'm hoping I don't have to fight #405.

276
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,810
Hmm, the results were more lopsided
than I was expecting.

277
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,510
Gon.

278
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,060
We've reached the Final Phase
of the exam.

279
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,290
Yeah.

280
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,070
Heart

281
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,070
Yes, that's good.

282
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

283
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,710
I've drawn up the bracket.

284
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,920
Huh?

285
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,580
What is this?

286
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,590
Ch-Chairman?

287
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,790
What?

288
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,590
Are you serious about this?

289
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,340
Dead serious.

290
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,970
He certainly has a serious expression.

291
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,850
Th-That's a serious expression?

292
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,850
Winning will make them Hunters.

293
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,560
Gon...

294
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,040
Hmm?

295
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,200
Did something happen during
the Fourth Phase?

296
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,600
When we met up,

297
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,370
you were acting a little strange.

298
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,240
And you've been somewhat subdued

299
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,270
since we left Zevil Island.

300
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,940
My target was Hisoka.

301
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,680
I waited for the perfect chance
and stole his tag,

302
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,660
but someone else was tailing me,

303
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,440
and he got me with a poisoned dart.

304
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,060
Soon after, Hisoka took back his tag

305
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,480
from the person who got me,
and he left it with me.

306
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,080
He said that I owed him now.

307
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,700
Hisoka said that?

308
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,760
I told him I didn't need his help,

309
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
and he sent me flying.

310
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,400
I'll only take it back

311
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,880
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

312
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,260
I was so mad

313
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,090
that I couldn't do anything against him...

314
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,040
After that, I was pretty
miserable and lonely.

315
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I felt so helpless,

316
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,760
I wanted company...

317
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,170
I wanted to help someone,

318
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,060
I guess.

319
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,850
That's why I was looking for you two.

320
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,210
Gon.

321
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,380
Leorio and I have only been able

322
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,250
to make it this far because of you.

323
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,650
We're truly grateful.

324
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,610
I'd also like to thank you.

325
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,130
Gon has deepened his bond
with his friends.

326
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,540
And the nine remaining
applicants are about

327
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,360
to begin the exam's Final Phase.

328
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,680
Next time: Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!

329
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,100
Then how am I supposed to win?

330
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,320
Just do it!
