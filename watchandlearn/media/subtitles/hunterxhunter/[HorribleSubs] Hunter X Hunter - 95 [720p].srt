2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,980
Looks like you guys have been
waiting here to kill me.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,990
Sorry, but the prey is about
to become the predator.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,450
You'll die before you can even strike back.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,970
Really?

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,800
I barely felt a thing.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,500
You could punch us like that a few
thousand times without killing us.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,910
I get it.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,900
You're trying to act tough.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,350
You're swinging long after the ball's
already in the catcher's mitt.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,350
Just as a warning, I'm not
using my full strength.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,970
I can run faster and throw harder punches.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,740
This is a surprise.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,280
He's actually aiming for my face.

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,550
I was certain his eyes couldn't
even follow my motion earlier...

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,080
Just a lucky guess?

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,040
Him, too...

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,750
He's clearly ascertaining where
I'm going to be before he attacks.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,550
It's only been a minute since I encountered them.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,550
They've adapted to my speed that quickly?

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,310
They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.

22
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,500
How amusing...

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,560
It makes this more of a challenge!

24
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,030
Grudge x And x Dread

25
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,220
Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...

26
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,510
You obviously can't compete physically.

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,320
How are you gonna compensate?

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,040
With guns? Numbers?

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,170
We'll use wit and experience.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,130
Where did this stuff come from?

31
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,410
Smoke? Gas?

32
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,680
Poison gas?

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,180
Or sleeping gas?

34
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,070
No, they're standing within it.

35
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,190
This must be some kind of special power.

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,090
Are you scared?

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,570
You can retreat if you want.

38
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,430
Does that mean you aren't running away?

39
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,080
Then this is a smokescreen.

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,110
They'll use it as cover for their attack.

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,520
Well, let's see what they can do...

42
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,130
Here it comes!

43
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,300
What?

44
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,680
When you use Gyo, your body freezes briefly.

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,560
This trick won't work on the same
opponent too many times.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,560
But it only needs to once.

47
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,490
I wouldn't be so sure.

48
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,240
That didn't hurt at all.

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,790
I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,

50
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,750
but you didn't do any damage.

51
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,330
What's this?

52
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,230
Gee, I wonder...

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,390
It's time.

54
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,580
Adding interest.

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,090
Answer me.

56
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,550
Answer me!

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,930
Your anger is blinding you
to your surroundings...

58
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,560
It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,640
Hey! Damn it!

60
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,510
They're gone?

61
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,240
Where are you?

62
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,820
It's time.

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,270
Adding interest.

64
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,720
It doesn't matter what your power does.

65
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,750
I just have to rip you apart!

66
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,500
Looks like he's powerless against Zetsu.

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,020
Well, we're dealing with
a level-one soldier ant.

68
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,520
With APR on him, we can easily track him.

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,940
We just need to chase him down,
box him in, and that'll be the end.

70
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,030
But doesn't your ability lose its effect
if the target moves too far away?

71
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,970
It'll stop adding interest,

72
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,540
but the effect will remain.

73
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,310
Once I'm back in range,
the counter will start up again.

74
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,830
But even if IRS doesn't kick in,
he'll be easy to finish off.

75
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,110
We've already learned his attacks.

76
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,350
You fool!

77
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,880
We may know what pitch he'll use,

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,930
but we still can't put the bat on the ball.

79
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,880
Let's leave him for a Nen user who's
better equipped to handle him.

80
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,930
You're right.

81
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...

82
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,930
Damn...

83
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,430
I can't shake this thing.

84
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,450
I can't outrun it...

85
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,450
So this is Nen.

86
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,450
I need more than just speed here.

87
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,320
Kite's in here.

88
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,730
He is no longer the person you once knew.

89
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,020
It's okay.

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,740
We'll find a way to cure him!

91
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,650
Hotel Rafflesia...

92
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,250
Hotel Rafflesia:
Dark Inn

93
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,630
Once I've dealt an enemy a
certain amount of damage,

94
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm able to trap

95
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,450
an entire body or merely a single part inside.

96
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,510
This must be how he took my eye.

97
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,710
If I release him from the cage,
he'll return to his original size.

98
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,030
Be careful.

99
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,790
He cannot use Nen, but he is still strong.

100
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,540
Kite...

101
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,050
Most likely, they used him to train soldiers.

102
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,860
He automatically attacks
anyone who approaches.

103
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,160
Kite...

104
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,400
It's okay now.

105
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,390
It's okay.

106
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,930
It's been a while...

107
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,900
since you punched me.

108
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,540
That hurt a lot...

109
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,970
You're going to let this beating continue?

110
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,390
Gon can't use Nen to defend himself either, right?

111
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,720
It's okay, Gon will notice.

112
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,420
Maybe he already has,

113
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,030
and is still...

114
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,030
Perhaps.

115
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,910
He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block,

116
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,570
allowing himself to be hit.

117
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,160
For real?

118
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,170
Kite's attacks may be robotic
and easy to anticipate.

119
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,980
But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt
so quickly in his current state!

120
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,890
I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.

121
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,020
This is the reality we've created
that we must now face.

122
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,850
He'll go right next.

123
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
Right again.

124
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,080
And then left.

125
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,030
Then a feint...

126
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,540
He really does fight like a robot.

127
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,080
Kite isn't this weak...

128
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,360
Kite's punches

129
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,550
hurt much more!

130
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,510
I'm sorry, Kite.

131
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,590
It's our fault you're like this...

132
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,890
Get some rest.

133
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,330
We'll take it from here.

134
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,510
Level two...

135
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,250
Gon can't see that thing,

136
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,850
but it activates when anyone touches Kite.

137
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,320
You must be highly skilled at
combat to clear this test.

138
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,860
I've already blocked Kite's Nen,

139
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,860
so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.

140
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,710
Be careful.

141
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,140
If you touch him again, he'll attack.

142
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,130
What do I do?

143
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,870
How did you stop him?

144
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,880
We injured him badly.

145
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,160
We had no choice, but I'm still sorry.

146
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,880
If you stay away, he won't attack.

147
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,110
Kite...

148
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,940
Just wait a little longer.

149
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,360
I'll get you back to normal soon.

150
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,080
Killua...

151
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,380
I want that one myself!

152
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,140
Killua...

153
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,760
I knew something was different when I saw you.

154
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,690
What did you guys do in the
short time since I saw you last?

155
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,200
We didn't do anything.

156
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,460
Our enemies did.

157
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,710
A Few Weeks Later

158
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Twenty-nine days have passed
since Gon lost his Nen.

159
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,770
Are you sure we should let them come along?

160
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,390
We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.

161
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,180
I see no problem with that.

162
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,470
The test was to determine
who would enter NGL...

163
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,430
And we are headed to the
Republic of East Gorteau.

164
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,990
Sounds like a technicality to me.

165
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,410
Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?

166
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,740
No, they're grown tigers now.

167
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,540
They can take care of themselves.

168
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,620
I would agree that Killua is capable,

169
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,380
but what about Gon?

170
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,510
At the very end, I was impressed
by the way he moved.

171
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,150
But he hasn't shown any fire since.

172
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,800
And he clearly isn't focused during training.

173
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,240
I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.

174
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,990
But he's consistently inconsistent.

175
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,310
He only gets serious when he absolutely must.

176
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,000
I think his lack of drive these past few
weeks will actually give him a boost.

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,450
A boost?

178
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,750
He's been saving up all that energy...

179
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,760
To unleash when he finds his hated foe.

180
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,730
Well, we'll see soon enough.

181
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,510
Tomorrow, Gon's Nen will return...

182
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,280
And the enemy is before us!

183
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,270
Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border

184
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,290
What is the agenda behind
the sudden flurry of activity

185
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,820
recently observed in East Gorteau?

186
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,030
Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited

187
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,790
all citizens to gather in the capital city,

188
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,420
Peijing, to celebrate the
nation's birth in ten days.

189
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,580
Yes, there have been occasions
in the past during which

190
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,300
all citizens were invited to participate.

191
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,090
However, we've never seen
anything on this scale,

192
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,050
where practically every citizen,

193
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,340
from babies to the ill, has been summoned
for a celebration spanning three days.

194
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,310
The logical conclusion would be that
the goal this time is different.

195
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,570
What do you believe the goal to be?

196
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,960
Well, it would send a powerful message

197
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,080
if he were to announce his successor
and abdication simultaneously.

198
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,580
But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme
Leader relinquishing his power.

199
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,840
It may also be meant to distract
from some other matter.

200
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,530
In any event, the whole world will be
watching East Gorteau in ten days.

201
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,270
Next...

202
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,350
Colt believes the celebration
will be used as a screening.

203
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,300
We don't know what they'll do
with those found to have Nen,

204
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,490
but ninety-nine percent of
the humans there will die.

205
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,740
We must stop it before that happens!

206
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,160
Our time limit is ten days.

207
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,740
What's the old man up to?

208
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,740
He sent an e-mail saying that he's
already inside East Gorteau,

209
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,290
but I haven't heard from him since.

210
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,500
Do you think he's been taken out?

211
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,590
If he fails to contact us today,

212
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,510
we've been told to assume as much.

213
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,770
Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman.

214
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,290
That old man's got some sharp ears...

215
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,040
He already knows everything.

216
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,780
Including the fact that you boys are here.

217
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,850
And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.

218
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,340
Divide into three pairs and draw the
Royal Guard away from the King.

219
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,390
The night before the celebration,
the operation will begin at midnight.

220
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,770
From the sharp-eared old man.

221
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,100
That guy really scares me...

222
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.

223
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,070
So I'll make myself scarce!

224
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,430
See you around...

225
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,190
Bye!

226
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,540
Okay, now you can use Nen again.

227
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,580
Give it a try.

228
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,090
Gon...

229
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,890
Sorry, but I'm still not convinced
we should keep you around.

230
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,590
Show me your resolve.

231
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,400
Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.

232
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,580
If your attack is too weak, we'll replace
you with another Hunter.

233
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,470
Seriously, the master can be so difficult.

234
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,730
He already agreed to bring Gon along...

235
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,280
Gon, show him your Jajanken.

236
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,740
You want me to attack you for real?

237
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,570
Don't insult me!

238
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,190
If you hold back in the slightest,
you're off the team!

239
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,850
Got it.

240
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,360
First comes rock...

241
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,790
Gon,

242
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,400
that's enough...

243
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,670
Right, big guy?

244
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,400
Y-Yeah...

245
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,410
Oh.

246
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,620
K-Killua, thank you.

247
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,660
Sorry about that, Morel-san!

248
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,790
I was really about to kill you!

249
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,380
You got me... You got me good.

250
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,750
You go crazy with the best of them.

251
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,240
We'll split up now.

252
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,290
Use whatever means you deem
best to fulfill your mission.

253
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,310
Gon and Killua, as you requested,
you're assigned to Neferpitou.

254
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,320
Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the
one called Menthuthuyoupi.

255
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,550
Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.

256
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,570
Best of luck to you.

257
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,040
The preparations for the final
battles are complete.

258
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,780
Ten days remain until that moment.

259
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,240
Next time: A x Lawless x Home.

260
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,610
Wanna see what being controlled is like?

261
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,540
Huh?

262
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,280
Stick this antenna here...

263
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,180
Huh?

264
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,270
It has to be Killua.
