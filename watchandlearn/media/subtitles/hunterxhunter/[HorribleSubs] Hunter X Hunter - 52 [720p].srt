2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,610
The calendar loses a precious component.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,760
The remaining months gather to mourn.

4
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,240
The mourners play a melody,

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,010
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

6
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,050
Assault x And x Impact

7
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,900
We will be making an emergency stop.

8
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,000
Please watch your step.

9
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,920
Did something happen?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,070
We are currently evaluating the situation.

11
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,340
Beats me.

12
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,300
It's me.

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,990
Are they here?

14
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah, it's gotta be them!

15
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,060
They're the only ones strong enough to fight

16
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,750
a whole crowd alone!

17
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,410
Hey... Hey!

18
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,260
Damn!

19
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,690
Figure out how many enemies we're up against!

20
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,840
Listen up! Do whatever
it takes to stop them!

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,230
Do not let them near this building!

22
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,430
They're late...

23
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,870
Our escort isn't here yet?

24
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,710
Their names are Melody and Basho.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,540
All traffic in Yorknew City has been stopped.

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,790
They're probably stuck.

27
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,180
It's dangerous for Neon to be here!

28
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,720
Isn't there any way to evacuate her?

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,800
The ambulance we requested is on its way.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
Please wait a little longer.

31
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,710
Ambulance?

32
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,530
Yes, that's right.

33
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,340
Something's wrong here.

34
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,940
The man who entered
the building with Neon

35
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,530
and then called for a doctor...

36
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,310
Boss.

37
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,900
Kurapika, don't take one step away

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,130
from my daughter until the ambulance arrives.

39
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,110
Got it?

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,070
But my assignment is to kill
the Phantom Troupe.

41
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,340
At the time, I thought that
Neon would already be home.

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,700
But instead, she's unconscious here,

43
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,040
exposed to the Troupe.

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,140
I absolutely must ensure Neon's safety.

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,890
Stay here for the time being.

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,210
I'm begging you.

47
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,260
Understood.

48
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,620
What a pity...

49
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,980
They aren't putting up much of a fight.

50
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,790
Well, I guess it was stupid to expect more—

51
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,910
Damn...

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,760
They're crazier than I've heard,

53
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,290
launching a frontal attack with ten people.

54
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,190
Man...

55
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,890
When did this place turn into a battlefield?

56
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,480
Where is the patient?

57
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,050
There's nothing to prove that you
aren't a Phantom Troupe member.

58
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,900
One funny move, and I'll blow your head off.

59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,390
Follow me.

60
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,160
Please allow me to check you all.

61
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,170
What's that?

62
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,790
Bastard...

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,000
Currently, all trains have been stopped.

64
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,800
For your safety, please wait patiently.

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,060
I'm not getting any reception down here.

66
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,830
And we don't know when the
trains will start moving again.

67
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,190
That settles it... We'll have to run.

68
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,230
You were hired to be an assassin,

69
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,540
so stop hiding in this room, and go fight.

70
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,420
Or did you get scared once
the Troupe showed up?

71
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,840
Oh, actually...

72
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,740
I requested that Kurapika stay here.

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,900
I understand that he's been
hired by the Ten Dons,

74
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,100
but I was worried about my daughter.

75
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,500
I don't intend to sell you out.

76
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,180
But you're being paid well,

77
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,110
so I expect you to do your job.

78
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,360
I agree

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,220
that I must do something.

80
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,740
I could at least patrol this building.

81
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,400
Yes, I suppose.

82
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,740
But you must come immediately if I call.

83
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,430
My daughter's safety comes first.

84
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,660
Understood.

85
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,550
How long do we have to wait?

86
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,010
Hey, what's going on outside?

87
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,260
I can hear explosions nearby!

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,410
When will the auction start?

89
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,660
Explain what's going on.

90
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,770
P-Please wait a little longer.

91
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,270
Tell us whether the auction's still on or not!

92
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,610
Everyone here is a gang leader or a big shot.

93
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,280
They're endangering themselves to prove

94
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,530
that they aren't afraid of the Troupe.

95
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,210
Return my phone!

96
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,080
I've no idea what's happening outside.

97
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,260
I need my weapons, too!

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,290
As you already know, weapons are banned.

99
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,660
What if they get inside?

100
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,050
Are we supposed to fight with our bare hands?!

101
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,260
It's becoming chaotic here...

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,670
The auctioneers and handlers will lose control

103
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,420
of the situation very soon.

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,670
Hello?

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,060
Oh, Kurapika?

106
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,810
Huh?

107
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,700
Whew, we finally got a hold of you.

108
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,510
Is this Gon?!

109
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,330
Yep, can you talk right now?

110
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,270
Uh, sorry, I'm in the middle of something.

111
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,430
I'll call you back.

112
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,520
Wait!

113
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,810
Can you give me one minute?

114
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,320
I have something to tell you.

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,830
Killua and I ran into the Troupe.

116
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,270
Actually, they caught us.

117
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,330
What were you guys thinking?!

118
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,910
Do you realize how dangerous they are?

119
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,340
Let me talk.

120
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,330
I thought I knew, but after we met
them, it became painfully clear.

121
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,880
They're strong.

122
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,240
Right now, we have no chance against them.

123
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,910
That's why we need your assistance.

124
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,850
We want to help.

125
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,250
That's ridiculous.

126
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,210
I won't help you get yourselves killed.

127
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,410
Don't you want to know where their base is?

128
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,860
I have my own sources of information.

129
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,940
Do you know all of their powers?

130
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,240
Enough! Just stay away from the Troupe!

131
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,890
You're the chain user who killed
one of their members, right?

132
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,750
They're looking everywhere for you.

133
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,890
If you won't treat us as friends or equals,

134
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,430
we'll do whatever we must to help!

135
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,890
Kurapika...

136
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,790
One of their members cried in front of us.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,620
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.

138
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,650
I got really mad after seeing that.

139
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,510
I couldn't let that go.

140
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,740
We want to stop them!

141
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,570
Please, Kurapika...

142
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,640
I'll call you back.

143
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,550
If you won't treat us as friends or equals...

144
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,120
We want to stop them!

145
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,780
Here they come!

146
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,510
Don't let them escape!

147
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,160
I can feel the heat!

148
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,300
Someone's coming!

149
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,960
Does he have a gun?

150
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Who's stationed here?

151
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,820
I-It's no use.

152
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,960
They're too strong.

153
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,790
We don't stand a chance...

154
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,990
How strong are they?!

155
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,790
This strong!

156
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,090
Damn it!

157
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,580
Aw, he broke.

158
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,220
I need to find my next machine.

159
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,890
Are you okay?

160
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,610
I found the corpse of one of the assassins!

161
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,840
Someone's already inside the building!

162
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,990
Damn it.

163
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,540
It's hopeless!

164
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,470
Hey, don't run away!

165
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,670
Fight!

166
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,140
Man, what's going on?

167
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,510
It's me.

168
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,050
Where's our backup?

169
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,120
What are you doing?

170
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,300
They should be there any moment.

171
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,910
We'll be arriving shortly...

172
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,110
You can't mean...

173
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,300
The two thousand men that were
supposed to assemble here

174
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,240
have all been wiped out?

175
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,030
Now what?

176
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,230
There are Troupe members inside the building.

177
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,680
It's me, Bean!

178
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,440
Get the Ten Dons on the line.

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,680
It's urgent!

180
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,080
The intruder must be a member of the Troupe.

181
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,690
Their objective is to steal the rest of the
merchandise and avenge their comrade.

182
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,200
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.

183
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,990
That's what I wanted!

184
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,450
Hey! Enough already!

185
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,970
Give us the weapons we handed over!

186
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,250
But the rules state that...

187
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,090
To hell with the rules!

188
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,540
Do you understand our situation?!

189
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,880
I know you've got professional assassins

190
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,070
wandering around this place!

191
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,930
If you're gonna depend on those freaks,

192
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,720
you might as well let us fight!

193
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,190
My name is Zeno Zoldyck.

194
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,660
The famous Zoldyck family of assassins!

195
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,780
The Ten Dons called in these monsters?

196
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,030
At the moment, one bandit has
infiltrated this building.

197
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,160
He has killed a number of the assassins

198
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,710
that your people hired.

199
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,510
Even if you were fully armed,

200
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,900
it would take me seven seconds
to kill the lot of you.

201
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,260
The enemy is capable of a similar feat.

202
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,700
If you understand, shut up and wait.

203
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,230
It's a different story if you want to die...

204
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,540
Well?

205
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,510
A single strike from behind.

206
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,490
Beautiful.

207
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,820
His presence was only exposed
for a brief instant,

208
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,070
and barely any trace remains.

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,590
I suppose I'll have to use En.

210
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,310
It's an exhausting technique.

211
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,670
Let's start from the roof and head down...

212
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,410
This building's radius is one hundred meters.

213
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,320
Will you be okay, old man?

214
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,190
Fool, if I wanted, I could
handle three times that.

215
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,200
This job is hardly worth the pay...

216
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,980
You're late, Kurapika!

217
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,740
Hurry back right now.

218
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,370
Stay at Neon's side!

219
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,910
Right, I'm on my way.

220
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,610
Damn!

221
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,170
We meet again.

222
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,760
You remember me?

223
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,800
How could I forget?

224
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,340
You killed one of my people.

225
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,730
It was difficult.

226
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,580
Careful, old man.

227
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
He can steal your techniques.

228
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,170
This could be hard, fighting one on two.

229
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,080
It takes a quality knife to scratch me.

230
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,930
Looks to be a mid-era Ben's knife.

231
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,040
That shape...

232
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,930
It's poisoned?

233
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,810
You okay?

234
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,730
I'm just fine.

235
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,390
Just fine?

236
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,740
A tenth of a milligram will
completely paralyze a whale.

237
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,600
So you can steal other people's Nen?

238
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,140
You must be a Specialist.

239
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,440
I would consider you a threat if you
could freely use the powers you steal.

240
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,280
However, you must take risks
to take those abilities.

241
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,510
A technique that strong must
have its drawbacks...

242
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,200
I would guess

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,640
you must clear four or five conditions
before you can steal an ability.

244
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,390
Correct.

245
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,020
The old man's a difficult opponent.

246
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,640
It will be difficult to clear those
conditions while you fight us.

247
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,500
Meaning that you won't be able

248
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,400
to steal our abilities while we fight.

249
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,910
Proven by your need to use a
poisoned knife as a deterrent.

250
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,750
Correct again.

251
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,160
I have no choice.

252
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,300
Silva, I'll need your support.

253
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,750
Once I lock him in place,

254
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,550
kill him, even if you have
to kill me with him.

255
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,300
Understood.

256
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,280
He focused his aura into his hand.

257
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,990
He has incredible potential.

258
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,520
I won't be able to block that attack.

259
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,330
Skill Hunter:
Bandit's Secret

260
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,960
A mantle...
A Conjurer ability?

261
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,270
This could be difficult...

262
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,490
Even if it's a stolen ability,
I can't attack recklessly

263
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,860
without knowing what it's capable of.

264
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,860
That would be an ordinary fighter's reaction...

265
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,500
Dragon Head: Long-Tou Xi-Hua

266
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,130
Dragon Lance

267
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,270
I see now...

268
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,370
His power is to seal other people's abilities

269
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,310
in that Conjured book

270
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,980
letting him use them freely.

271
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,910
In return, when he uses another ability,

272
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,540
he must hold that book
in his hands at all times.

273
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,670
The mantle is also a Conjured item.

274
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,860
He has shown no signs of taking the offensive,

275
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,380
but he's trying to close the gap between us.

276
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,570
So it's a defensive tool that can be used

277
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,230
to close the distance and counterattack.

278
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,060
Which means I have no reason
not to fight from a distance.

279
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,110
Then I wait for my chance, and grab it.

280
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,530
This old man is incredible.

281
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,320
He managed to read my mind in a flash.

282
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm guessing I can't capture him alive.

283
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,540
When he shuts the book,

284
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,830
the ability he withdrew also vanishes?

285
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,750
In any case, he's quite talented.

286
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,010
He dodges each of my old man's
attacks at the last second,

287
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,760
leaving me no opening to attack.

288
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,710
He's physically stronger than before.

289
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,900
Since we don't know what abilities he has,

290
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,700
we can't finish him off

291
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,620
without being willing to risk our lives.

292
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,210
Now! Kill him!

293
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,130
A thundering boom resounded
through Yorknew City.

294
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,730
Kurapika had no idea that the shock wave

295
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,110
would lead to an unexpected development.

296
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

297
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

298
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

299
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

300
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

301
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

302
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

303
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

304
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:19,960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

305
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,500
Today, we introduce Shalnark.

306
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,740
A Phantom Troupe member.

307
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,480
A Phantom Troupe member.

308
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,660
He's smart, knowledgeable, and calculating.

309
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,870
With his sharp mind,

310
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,910
His Nen ability places an antenna on targets,

311
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,960
he's tasked with gathering
information and data analysis.

312
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,500
letting him control them with his cell phone.

313
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,120
Black Voice!

314
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,700
Next time: Fake x And x Psyche!

315
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,240
Kopitor?

316
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,810
Kotorpi?

317
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,410
Kortopi!
