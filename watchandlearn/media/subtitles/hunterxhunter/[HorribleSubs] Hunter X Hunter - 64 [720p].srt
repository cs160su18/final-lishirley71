2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,480
All right!

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,090
We made it through!

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,980
Good work!

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,690
I think we've gone five kilometers today.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,670
At first, I thought it would take years,

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,240
but at this pace...

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,930
Masadora!

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,810
Take two!

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,830
Okay!

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,970
Let's return to the starting point now.

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,400
Again?!

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Strengthen x And x Threaten

14
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,170
Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,640
You have the requisite physical strength
to defeat every enemy here.

16
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,150
What you lack

17
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,190
is the ability to come up with
a plan of attack as you fight.

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,190
In other words, the ability to strategize.

19
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,910
The ability to...

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,320
...strategize.

21
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,170
I'm not going to say a single word,

22
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,820
so devise your own means
to defeat the monsters.

23
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,080
Still, the people who made this
game really were special...

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,540
The game's programmed in such a way

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,390
that you're guaranteed to get
stronger as you progress.

26
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,590
And, most likely, all for the purpose

27
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,080
of making him stronger.

28
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,630
Yes!

29
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,550
I got the Marimo-chi!

30
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,150
Nen battles require one to fight
against many different enemy types.

31
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,790
The ability to think on your feet

32
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,660
is the most critical technique.

33
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,540
First, get used to thinking all the time,

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,160
until your thinking is tied to your reflexes.

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,160
This game is a training program
to help you achieve that.

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,050
The hardest monster in this
area is the Bubble Horse.

37
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,060
If they clear that hurdle,

38
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,390
they'll complete the second stage!

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
Zetsu!

40
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,810
Caught it!

41
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,330
I got a Bubble Horse!

42
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,210
Way to go.

43
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,920
Yep!

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,550
When it comes to analysis and
physical strength, Killua's stronger.

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,580
But Gon makes up for it with his
concentration and recovery speed.

46
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,090
They make a perfect team!

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,090
Okay, we'll now begin to
work on your defense.

48
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,540
Is that...

49
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,930
That's right, Gon.

50
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,100
This is the technique you've been using.

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,100
Ten

52
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,460
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu, and Gyo

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,980
Zetsu

54
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,900
Ren

55
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,730
Hatsu

56
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,530
Gyo

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,640
are combined in this technique.

58
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,860
Ko!

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Ko

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,460
You focus all of your aura into one
part of your body, then attack.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,120
This gives it far greater power
than your regular attacks.

62
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm going to attack with my fist.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,600
You must block my attacks.

64
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,130
You may not dodge.

65
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,390
You've figured it out?

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,380
That's right...

67
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,500
If you use your aura to block normally,

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
you'll take considerable damage.

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,270
So what should you do?

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,300
We should use Ko, too.

71
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,640
You're half right.

72
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,860
Ko against Ko.

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,440
As long as you and your opponent
are similar in Nen capacity,

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,020
you'll escape unscratched.

75
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,400
However...

76
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,960
If your opponent hits you in a place
where you weren't using Ko,

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,370
you'll be destroyed.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,300
Then we should use Ko on our entire body.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Though it's contradictory.

80
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,540
Exactly.

81
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,940
This technique combines Ten and Ren.

82
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,290
Ken.

83
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,470
Ken

84
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,310
You defend yourself

85
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,920
by shrouding your body in
much more aura than usual.

86
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,850
It isn't as strong as Ko,
but it's far more practical.

87
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,930
Gon, use Ren.

88
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,440
To sustain that for a prolonged
period is called Ken.

89
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,080
Now protect yourself from my punch!

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,810
So slow.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,090
You must have relaxed when you
saw how slowly I was moving.

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,530
If you'd stopped using Ken,
your face would have been smashed.

93
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,310
That was the power of Ko alone.

94
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,860
When I add the speed and power
packed by a normal punch,

95
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,100
it becomes many times stronger.

96
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,230
Even dozens of times stronger.

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,990
I'll start by going slowly,
but you won't get any warning.

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,620
Keep using Ken, and try to
withstand my attacks.

99
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Gon!

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,390
Hmm, that was almost two minutes...

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,890
I had no idea it could be this
hard to keep up my Nen.

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,600
You need to be able to sustain
Ken for at least thirty minutes,

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,530
or you won't stand a chance.

104
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,330
Okay, we're through!

105
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,030
Learning to use Ken!

106
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,050
Good, that was thirty minutes!

107
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,050
Over the past month,
you've become a lot tougher.

108
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,630
The number 3!

109
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,750
Bingo!

110
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,180
Killua was slightly faster.

111
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,720
Gon, give me a thousand push-ups.

112
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,350
Okay, we'll begin actual
combat training today.

113
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,810
Ken!

114
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,420
In your current state, your attack
power is 50, defense 50.

115
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,820
So if you fight each other while using Ken,

116
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,690
you won't be able to deal much damage.

117
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,830
What should you do?

118
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,570
Use Ko!

119
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,970
You fool.

120
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,910
What if he hits you where
you aren't using Ko?

121
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,160
Use Gyo?

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Correct!

123
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,180
From your current 50-50 state,

124
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,560
at the moment of attack,

125
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,160
you shift your fist to 70 POW,

126
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,850
and the rest to 30 POW.

127
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,550
You can use Gyo to alter your POW
depending on the situation.

128
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,020
This is Ryu!

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,860
Ryu

130
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,580
Let's get started...

131
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,860
Right hand to 70 POW,
rest of your body to 30 POW!

132
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,180
It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out.

133
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,180
Left leg to 80 POW,
rest of your body to 20 POW!

134
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,130
Head to 60 POW,
rest of your body to 40 POW!

135
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,120
Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day.

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,530
Add it to your current training menu.

137
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,390
Also...

138
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,640
We'll begin sparring now.

139
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,270
Use Ryu the way I just taught you.
You can start out slow.

140
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,370
When you're on the defensive,
determine your opponent's attack power

141
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,970
before defending with Ryu.

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,280
With that said...

143
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Begin!

144
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,150
I'll go first, then.

145
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,660
Right leg, 55 POW.

146
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Right leg, 60 POW, I think...

147
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,660
Left hand, 60 POW.

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,120
Right fist, 80 POW!

149
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,560
Left elbow, 80 POW!

150
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,180
If they keep this up daily, for two months,

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,990
they'll be able to fight at
full speed while using Ryu.

152
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,660
After that, it'll be time for the final stage.

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,910
Okay!

154
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
Time for a break!

155
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,890
Thank you very much!

156
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,670
Osu!

157
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,920
It's been two weeks.

158
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,170
They've made a lot of progress...

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
It appears you're ready for the final stage.

160
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,820
The final stage?

161
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,680
Yes, you will begin training in
the individual categories.

162
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,840
3!

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,930
Bingo!

164
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,430
A draw.

165
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,430
You're free to train solely in your own category.

166
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,690
In the case of an Enhancer...

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Enhancer

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.

169
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,790
You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills,

170
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,090
while training the nearby categories

171
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,840
of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion.

172
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,200
Then you'll master your own category faster.

173
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,390
9!

174
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,450
Bingo!

175
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,950
A draw.

176
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,090
Good job, Killua.

177
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,950
Same to you.

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Then, let's get started.

179
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,960
Osu!

180
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,960
Today, we'll be training in
the Enhancer category.

181
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,840
Level 1 is smashing rocks.

182
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,220
Crush them like this.

183
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,720
Smash a thousand with a single stone
in a day, and you clear the level.

184
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,590
And begin!

185
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,030
This is pretty tough.

186
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,170
All I'm doing is

187
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,740
changing the stone to 100 POW
at the moment of impact.

188
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,740
But my Nen is weakening as I go.

189
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,500
Oops, it crumbled...

190
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,720
If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over.

191
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
Damn!

192
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,630
Damn, I failed!

193
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,880
What are you talking about?
You did well.

194
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,460
Okay!

195
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,190
Let's do Transmuter training next.

196
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,490
Now, now, don't rush.

197
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,140
You're only allowed to train
one category per day.

198
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,480
6!

199
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,390
Bingo! A draw.

200
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,050
Again?

201
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,970
These days, we keep getting draws.

202
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,650
That just shows that you've both
grown accustomed to using Gyo.

203
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,670
But if there's no winner, it's no fun.

204
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,160
Okay, then we'll decide
with rock-paper-scissors.

205
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,240
The loser does a thousand push-ups!

206
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
Sure.

207
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,480
First comes rock...

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,150
Rock, paper, scissors!

209
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,620
One more time!

210
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,590
I win!

211
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,650
Damn!

212
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,940
Hey, boys...

213
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,180
Have you heard the theory that
rock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?

214
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,670
Huh?

215
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,620
Palm

216
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,020
Paper represents a palm attack that
wrecks the opponent's organs.

217
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,640
Fingers

218
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,600
Scissors represents a finger jab,
targeting vital points.

219
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,690
Fist

220
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,410
And rock represents a punch with
the fist to deal external damage.

221
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:48,870
Evil Fist

222
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,470
Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken

223
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,890
as purely destructive and banned as an evil art,

224
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,880
martial artists trained by playing this game.

225
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,570
And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.

226
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,960
You really are old...

227
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,460
That's it!

228
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,080
Eh?

229
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,140
Evil Fist.

230
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,020
Now, everyone.

231
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,480
We have a total of 133 cards from
90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.

232
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,660
This is the product of your hard work.

233
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,730
You have our thanks.

234
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,460
Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7.

235
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,930
They're as good as ours.

236
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,080
However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained

237
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,010
an equal number of restricted slot cards.

238
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,790
The final hurdle will likely be a
showdown against their group.

239
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,130
But I believe we have more,
and better, spell cards!

240
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,630
Gentlemen, our victory is near!

241
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,840
Can I say something?

242
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,020
These five years have been
so long, yet so short...

243
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,520
There's something I must tell you.

244
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,030
I am the Bomber.

245
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,050
What? The Bomber?

246
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,410
H-Hey, what are you talking about?

247
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,910
Now, now... Hear me out.

248
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,670
I've placed bombs on all of you.

249
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,670
What was that?

250
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,420
How did you do that?!

251
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,050
Don't mess with us!

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,800
Stay calm and listen.

253
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,470
Good grief.

254
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,690
You ruined the explanation I'd planned.

255
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,410
This is my power...

256
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,210
Little Flower.

257
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,440
Fistful of Gunpowder
Little Flower

258
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,980
As you just saw,

259
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,440
I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.

260
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,950
But it isn't very strong.

261
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,050
He's still alive.

262
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,950
However,

263
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,460
if the bombs on your bodies explode,

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,090
you will die.

265
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,210
A bomb? Where is it?

266
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,470
I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.

267
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,770
Let's start with how I set them.

268
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,270
That was by touching the place on
the target I wanted to explode,

269
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,350
and saying a certain keyword.

270
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,480
The keyword is

271
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,730
"Bomber."

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,560
It was the Bomber again.

273
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,230
Listen... Beware of the Bomber.

274
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,230
In order to disarm the bombs,

275
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,890
you must touch my body and say,
"I caught the Bomber."

276
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,760
However, I also have the Little Flower ability.

277
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,890
I can use this to stop anyone
who tries to touch me.

278
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,030
You must be very careful as you
attempt to disarm the bombs.

279
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,410
That's all.

280
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,670
They're armed.

281
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,150
This is the ability Countdown.

282
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,530
Sound of Life
Countdown

283
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,540
Why am I telling you so
much about my powers?

284
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,040
That's the condition for arming the bombs.

285
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,880
Then you've been waiting for
the day when all the cards

286
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,550
and members were gathered.

287
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,290
Now, I have a proposition.

288
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,550
I will trade your lives for those
90 restricted slot cards.

289
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,520
If you agree, I will use an alternative method,

290
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,940
and simultaneously disarm all the bombs.

291
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,390
Do nothing, and all of you will die
when the counter reaches zero.

292
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,700
You should discuss this amongst yourselves.

293
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,520
I'll be waiting for you at
Mr. Battera's old mansion.

294
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,570
I don't care who comes, but come alone.

295
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,710
Are you insane?

296
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,660
If we just catch you now and
disarm the bombs, it's all over.

297
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,160
Do you think you can escape alone?!

298
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,410
Calm yourselves...

299
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,530
If you get too excited,
the countdown will accelerate.

300
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,710
Because the counter is linked
to your heartbeat.

301
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,350
What?

302
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,430
Book!

303
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,880
Crap!

304
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,610
I pray we meet again!

305
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,110
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

306
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,110
Leave on!

307
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,030
He escaped outside the game!

308
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,870
We have to follow him...

309
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,060
Wait!

310
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,180
If we leave, the cards inside
our binders will vanish!

311
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,500
Then what do we do?

312
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,280
Calm down!

313
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,500
It would be unwise to chase him down!

314
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,230
Have you forgotten why we teamed up?

315
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,510
Because we aren't strong fighters!

316
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,900
Does anyone here think they're
strong enough to defeat him?

317
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,600
It would be impossible.

318
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,020
Given his Nen abilities, he must be powerful.

319
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,660
If all of us attacked him together,

320
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,020
he could use Little Flower to defeat us all.

321
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,280
Damn, we were so close!

322
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,230
First, we must reach a consensus.

323
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,800
Do we hand over the cards?

324
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,610
Or do we fight?

325
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,410
Please give him the cards...

326
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,620
I beg you.

327
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,000
Jispa's running out of time...

328
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,430
That's a surprise.

329
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,870
I was expecting Nickes to come.

330
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,340
I'm surprised, too.

331
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,060
I didn't expect you to be alone...

332
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,260
Sub and Bara.

333
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,310
They're the other bombers.

334
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,320
Now give me your ring.

335
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,180
What's wrong?

336
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,870
I can't turn it over yet...

337
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,430
Actually, we still haven't reached a decision.

338
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,630
And Nickes has requested the Breath
of Archangel card to save Jispa.

339
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,800
Screw that!

340
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,820
As it stands, neither side can win this!

341
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,590
Eh?

342
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,320
You don't realize how hysterical they are.

343
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,000
If they can't make a decision before
time expires and they explode,

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,970
you'll lose the data in their rings!

345
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,550
But I can—

346
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,470
But you can convince them?

347
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,140
Are you trying to bargain with me?

348
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,240
When striking a bargain,

349
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,490
you have to demonstrate just
how calm and insane you are.

350
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,140
W-Wait...

351
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,990
If you kill me...

352
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,580
Don't worry.

353
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,140
If you kill a player outside the
game and take their ring,

354
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,130
the restricted slot data will not vanish.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,130
Well, I doubt you have any of the cards.

356
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
A gift.

357
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,670
Puhat!

358
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,400
You won't get another chance.

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,490
Okay?

360
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,780
Leave...

361
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,310
The spell card! Leave!

362
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,490
I need to exit, so give it to me.

363
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,160
Hell, no!

364
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,110
Leave is a valuable card.

365
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,500
We can't waste any!

366
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,990
Okay, then...

367
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,650
If I don't return,

368
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,810
it won't be possible to disarm all
your bombs simultaneously.

369
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,510
What?

370
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm also a bomber.

371
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,540
There are three of us.

372
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,690
Well, Genthru's the main one,

373
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,770
and we're just extras.

374
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,460
When the three of us join our
right thumbs and say the keyword,

375
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,160
the bombs will be destroyed.

376
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,280
That's the alternative method.

377
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,560
Whatever...

378
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,490
I'll take my time returning
via normal means.

379
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,570
You guys will be dead soon.

380
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,280
Wait! Hold on!

381
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,880
Please use this.

382
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,540
You should have done that
in the first place, scum!

383
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,990
We'll need Leave cards
when the deal is made.

384
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,420
Have three ready.

385
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,050
Got it?

386
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,290
Twelve hours before Genthru
revealed himself as the Bomber,

387
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,030
a single boat attempted to
invade from the outside.

388
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,490
So it does exist in the real world.

389
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,330
That's gotta be Greed Island.

390
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,470
G.I. Tutorial

391
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

392
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
Today, we introduce the card Leave.

393
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:19,040
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

394
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,960
This takes us back to the real world?

395
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,080
That's nice.

396
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,050
If you're going out, leave the free slot cards.

397
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,640
Stupid onliner!

398
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,690
Huh?

399
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

400
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,260
Next time: Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.

401
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,300
See ya here next week!

402
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,280
Rock, paper, scissors!
