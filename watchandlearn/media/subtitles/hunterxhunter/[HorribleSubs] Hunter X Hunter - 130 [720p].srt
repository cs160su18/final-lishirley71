2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,090
Damn... Almost.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,780
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,250
What's going on?

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,130
He wasn't aiming for me...

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,290
He was aiming for the woman.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,700
He was trying to kill her!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Magic x Of x Despair

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,290
He's back.

10
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,400
The King has returned.

11
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,430
Hey, aren't we too close?

12
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,250
It's okay...

13
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,680
We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.

14
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,440
The problem will be when
the King and Pouf split up.

15
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,440
Should I remove APR from Pouf,
and use it on the King?

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,420
These are known as human grapes.

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,360
The humans fit to become
soldiers wait here to hatch.

18
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,540
Hurry!

19
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,060
Hurry!

20
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,590
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

21
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,930
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

22
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,810
There it is.

23
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,240
Hide it fast.

24
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,360
Hurry! Hurry!

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,980
Faster! Faster!

26
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,990
Faster! Faster!

27
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,430
Hurry! Hurry!

28
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,180
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

29
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,880
Hurry! Hurry!

30
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,200
We must also hurry!

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,260
Where is Welfin?

32
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,110
These won't work.

33
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,370
When the bodies are ripped apart,
I can't use Living Dead Dolls.

34
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,850
Killua...

35
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,020
The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!

36
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,790
Yeah.

37
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,310
We should circle around, following the wall,

38
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,250
and hide in the crowd.

39
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,200
Okay.

40
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,030
What about Gon and Pitou?

41
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,000
They just entered the Peijing hiding place.

42
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,000
They're walking down a hallway.

43
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,860
How does that crystal work now?

44
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,240
You can also see Pouf and me in it?

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,560
Yes, looking from a bit above.

46
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,620
Wink Blue uses my crystal ball

47
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,860
to remember people seen through my right eye.

48
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,120
Looking through only my left eye,

49
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,700
I can watch those people's current
positions in the crystal ball.

50
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,550
At the moment, the crystal ball
is simultaneously showing

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,510
Gon and Pitou, Killua and me,

52
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,010
as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi.

53
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,430
It's like watching a TV screen
that's been split up.

54
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,030
However, my right eye has only
seen Pouf, you, and Gon.

55
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,470
So I can only see the others when
they're around one of you.

56
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,720
And I can only use my power to
watch three people at once.

57
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,940
If I see someone else with my right eye,

58
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,230
I won't be able to see the oldest
of the three targets, Pouf.

59
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.

60
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,610
If you can only see his main body,
and his clones are scattered,

61
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,560
it's probably more a minus than a plus.

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,740
Is that so?

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,630
If I can only see his main body,

64
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,370
that also means I won't be fooled by clones.

65
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,630
And if his main body is only the size
of a fly, I can literally crush him.

66
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,530
Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.

67
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,850
What greater plus is there?

68
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,390
So they figured me out.

69
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,120
Then I just need to use that against them.

70
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,690
Walk forward.

71
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,370
It's the right door, at the end.

72
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,950
Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,

73
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,950
Pitou's hearing was sharp
enough to pick up the voice

74
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,080
on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.

75
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,370
Pitou-sama, this is Welfin.

76
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,220
I will keep this as brief as I can.

77
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,470
Brovada and I have retaken the girl.

78
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,070
Intruders are still around,

79
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,430
so we're taking refuge beneath the palace.

80
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,410
I will let you hear her voice.

81
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,400
Hello? Pitou-sama?

82
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,250
This is Komugi.

83
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,880
I'm fine, so don't worry.

84
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,360
Got it...

85
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,050
Goodbye.

86
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,780
Was that good?

87
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,780
Yes.

88
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,690
If possible,

89
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,290
can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?

90
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,210
It's him, right?

91
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,590
Since I can split myself at the cellular level,

92
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,820
I can also become different people.

93
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,590
I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices.

94
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,850
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...

95
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,530
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.

96
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,240
So, keep watching Gon and Pitou.

97
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,150
You should see something interesting soon...

98
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,270
Now, heal Kite, like you promised.

99
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,150
Once that's done, I'll release her.

100
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,280
Your name...

101
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,470
What is your name?

102
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,830
Gon.

103
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,310
Gon Freecss.

104
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,560
Gon...

105
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,190
You listened to my request.

106
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,430
So I will be honest with you.

107
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,560
He is

108
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,410
already

109
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,810
dead.

110
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,920
Dead?

111
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,920
He died during our fight.

112
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,920
I remember now.

113
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,590
Back then, you were...

114
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,480
I was unable to revive one who was dead.

115
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,700
My power could only prevent

116
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,730
the body from decomposing,

117
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,710
and control its movements.

118
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,820
His soul is no longer here.

119
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,980
There is no way to heal him.

120
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,590
I am sorry.

121
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,200
Palm...

122
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,040
Yes?

123
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,280
Thank you.

124
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,980
What? What's this?

125
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,760
What are you thanking me for?

126
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,740
Stuff...

127
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,040
Stuff? Such as?

128
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,050
Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!

129
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,680
What was that?

130
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,430
It seems wrong to make me mad
while you're thanking me!

131
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,640
Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.

132
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,640
Because now we're friends.

133
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,120
I never say thanks to my friends.

134
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,790
Anyway, how's Gon?

135
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,020
Y-Yes, that's right...

136
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,480
What's wrong?

137
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,710
It can't be...

138
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,960
What's going on?!

139
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,020
Kite...

140
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,600
Kite is...

141
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,430
dead.

142
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,890
Man, forced to take another life...

143
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,280
You've grown, Gon.

144
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,380
If I...

145
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,610
If I...

146
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,640
Whether we win or lose,

147
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,560
hell lies ahead of us.

148
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,380
If I hadn't gone with him...

149
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,870
Kite wouldn't have died.

150
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,870
It was...

151
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,420
It was my fault.

152
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,700
It was because I tagged along...

153
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,360
It was really my fault...

154
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,180
Get away from me!

155
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,340
It's my fault that Kite is...

156
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,070
No... It isn't my fault!

157
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,600
Pitou's the one who killed him!

158
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,030
Not me!

159
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,430
But it was me...

160
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,500
It was me....

161
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,660
I killed Kite.

162
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,560
It's my fault...

163
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,600
No! It's Pitou's fault!

164
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,430
But it's really my fault.

165
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,520
Kite is alive!

166
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,900
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

167
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,640
Kite is dead...

168
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,900
Kite is dead.

169
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,300
Kite is dead.

170
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,630
Kite is dead...

171
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,420
Kite is dead!

172
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,250
Help...

173
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,530
Someone help...

174
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,940
Kite is... Kite is...

175
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,930
Kite is... Kite is...

176
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,750
Kite...

177
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,490
Just wait a little longer.

178
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,760
I'll get you back to normal soon.

179
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,660
I can't get him back to normal.

180
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,560
Kite is gone...

181
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,030
It's my fault.

182
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,020
Someone help...

183
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,170
Someone help Kite—

184
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,210
No! No! No! No! No!

185
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,210
But... But...

186
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,210
But...

187
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,720
But... But... But... But...

188
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,720
But...

189
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,620
Doctor Blythe.

190
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,250
What?

191
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,260
Pitou's going to help Kite?

192
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,640
Oh, it's true...

193
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,780
Kite being dead was a lie.

194
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,680
Pitou will heal him.

195
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,260
Huh?

196
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,470
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?

197
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,270
Turn Kite back to normal.

198
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,140
Please...

199
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,230
After you finish what you're doing.

200
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,700
Why? What's going on?!

201
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,960
What's wrong? What happened, Palm?

202
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,530
I don't know...

203
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,310
I can only see what's happening...

204
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,960
But something is wrong with Gon!

205
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,670
What's wrong?!

206
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,960
Pitou is healing itself, not Kite.

207
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,300
Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.

208
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,580
Impossible...

209
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,480
As long as she's in our hands, Pitou...

210
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,960
Pitou has to obey us!

211
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,320
Please...

212
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,950
Help Kite.

213
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,670
Next time: Anger x And x Light.

214
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,220
Hold on until I get there!

215
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,510
I don't care if this is the end...

216
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,760
I'll kill you, Pitou!

217
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,610
Gon!
