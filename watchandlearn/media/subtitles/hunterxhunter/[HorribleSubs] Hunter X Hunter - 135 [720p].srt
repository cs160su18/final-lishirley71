00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,880
The King transformed his En
into countless particles,

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,680
and scattered them everywhere.

4
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,010
If there are conditions I must meet
for you to turn over Komugi,

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,940
speak.

6
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
This Person x And x This Moment

7
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,490
It appears that only one of you is here,

8
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,010
but I shall address this
message to both of you.

9
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,190
He knows exactly what we're doing.

10
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,750
We won't be able to trick him.

11
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,770
When I felt after coming into
contact with your Nen

12
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,180
was not anger, fear, or hatred.

13
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,010
Only senses of duty and resolve.

14
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,770
If you are fighting for the survival
of humanity, your battle is over.

15
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,410
You need further explanation?

16
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,030
It seems you doubt what you've just heard.

17
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,280
Then I shall repeat myself.

18
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,280
You have won... The battle is over.

19
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,540
The rest of what I have to
say is for your ears only.

20
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,770
The reason I am here is quite simple.

21
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,540
I have one motive...

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,590
I wish to see the human named Komugi.

23
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,050
That is all I want.

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,220
That is really all I want.

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,370
I desire nothing else.

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,470
After coming into contact with your Nen,

27
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,090
I learned my current state and fate.

28
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,570
And having learned my fate, I simply wish

29
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,770
to spend my remaining time with Komugi.

30
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,130
That is all I want.

31
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,590
Was this...

32
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,280
Was this a plan you devised after
discovering my personality?

33
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,410
No, I already know the answer...

34
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,350
It's impossible.

35
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,870
You expect me to believe you?

36
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,730
You think I'll just accept that explanation?!

37
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,820
An omnipotent King would
never lie to himself in order

38
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,870
to fool a lower being like me!

39
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,210
After all the killing you have done,
and soon will do...

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,870
A creature like you...

41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,380
The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?

42
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,380
Impossible! That's impossible!

43
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,010
He's doing this because it is the truth!

44
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,790
I believe it was only a slight change...

45
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,960
Huh?

46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:16,020
Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly.

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,620
In my current state, I am not a god,

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,530
but I...

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,530
No...

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,900
Perhaps, I only feel this way
because everything has fallen into place.

51
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,800
You should know I have very little time.

52
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,110
I want you to tell me her location,

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,920
so I do not have to search for her.

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
What are you saying?!

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
Stop this...

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,900
Yes, I know where she is!

57
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,450
Why don't you just torture it out of me?

58
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,930
I know the answer.

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,940
We both know that isn't an option.

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,940
Your aura is as strong and beautiful
as any I have ever beheld.

61
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,810
Stop this!

62
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,200
All I can do is to ask you to help me.

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
Don't!

64
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,920
I am part Ant now...

65
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:40,700
I know very well how important
you are to the race...

66
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,800
Not that...

67
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,300
Don't go to such lengths...

68
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,880
You mustn't do that...

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,380
I'll tell you.

70
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,020
But on one condition.

71
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,760
May I use my power

72
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,260
to watch your final moments with her?

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,770
If that is what it takes to be with Komugi,

74
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,550
you certainly may.

75
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,400
Sorry, Killua...

76
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,360
I couldn't

77
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,760
keep our promise...

78
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,760
4-7-1, marshal...

79
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,770
Wake up, Komugi.

80
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,610
It's time to play.

81
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,030
We have a shocking news update.

82
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,360
The true purpose of the summoning

83
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,100
of all Republic of East Gorteau
citizens to the capital city

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,770
was a plot by the Supreme
Leader to massacre them.

85
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,260
The body of Supreme Leader Diego
was discovered under the rubble,

86
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,170
suggesting that the victims were
likely forced into mass suicide.

87
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,720
But the second-in-command,
Secretary Bizeff, is still missing,

88
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,230
so some authorities believe a
revolution is the greater likelihood.

89
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,560
Meanwhile, there has also been trouble

90
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,990
in the NGL region of the Mitene Union,
as international peacekeepers

91
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,650
have sent queries regarding refugees,

92
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,990
and have received no response.

93
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,450
There have been rumors of

94
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,980
illicit dealings between
East Gorteau and NGL,

95
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,210
and the international community
seeks to use this incident

96
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,570
as an opportunity to conduct
a more forceful investigation.

97
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,590
Yeah, the boss did his duty.

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,510
No, I wasn't there to see it.

99
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,770
It still isn't clear yet.

100
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,370
Yeah, we're waiting on Palm.

101
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,950
Can we really trust her alone

102
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,890
to verify the King's death?

103
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,000
Plus, that person was captured and

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
converted by the enemy, yes?

105
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,830
Well, that's a question of professionalism.

106
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,430
It would be professional

107
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,460
to provide a complete report
in the safest manner possible.

108
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,160
But those are the professionals who spend

109
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,400
all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.

110
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,570
And when we field Hunters are told
to trust a partner, we trust them.

111
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,430
We're all professionals...

112
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,260
But I'm the one out in the field!

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,680
I'm not sitting in an office!

114
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,020
The Vice Chairman's faction won't
accept that argument.

115
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,940
If they find out, you can expect
to be questioned, at the least.

116
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,920
Uh, I am Netero...

117
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,650
Chairman, thank you for a job well done.

118
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,290
May you rest in peace.

119
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,980
The same day, a video was streamed
online in which Netero announced

120
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,660
his resignation as Chairman
of the Hunter Association,

121
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,490
and gave instructions for
choosing his successor.

122
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,670
However, major news stories in the
government-run media overshadowed it,

123
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,200
and only a few realized that
the video was his will.

124
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,580
Now, let us drink.

125
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,220
Let us drink.

126
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,510
Drink to the human race.

127
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:06,310
In every age, there will be good
humans and bad humans.

128
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,250
Human life is too long
to devote to reproduction,

129
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,280
yet too short to devote to learning,
in the helix of time.

130
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,640
Perhaps that is why humans succumb
to desire and seek release.

131
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:30,450
Despite the fact that life is complete
with the sun, the land, and poetry.

132
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,920
Supreme Leader Diego (Real)
In his 30th year of retirement,
on a farm, in an unnamed country

133
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,190
It's over...

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,200
But it feels like we
haven't played in ages...

135
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,900
Playing in real life is completely different
than playing in my dreams.

136
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,770
Yes.

137
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,210
I thought I felt someone kick
me hard in the stomach.

138
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,030
After that, a strange person kidnapped me...

139
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,400
But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader.

140
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,690
It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.

141
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,850
I was wrong?!

142
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,230
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

143
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,210
I was unworthy of their loyalty...

144
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,770
When they stop by, I must thank them.

145
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,230
I will relay your gratitude.

146
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,090
I'll be seeing them soon...

147
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,220
I know. Let's begin.

148
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,930
Yes!

149
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,920
Once, you asked my name.

150
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,630
Y-Yes...

151
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,720
My name is Meruem.

152
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,860
Meruem.

153
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,990
It means the light that illuminates all.

154
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,340
Meruem-sama?

155
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,190
M-My name is Komugi...

156
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,480
It is an honor to know you!

157
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
I know.

158
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,840
No...

159
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,510
That isn't true.

160
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
I knew nothing.

161
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,770
I didn't understand what really mattered.

162
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,640
Meruem-sama?

163
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,170
No honorific is necessary.

164
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,410
Don't make me repeat myself!

165
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,810
No honorific is necessary!

166
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,830
B-But, I could never do that!

167
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,010
I would never dare address
you without an honorific!

168
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,700
Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will
address me without the honorific.

169
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,530
I understand.

170
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,850
Do I die after I've addressed
you without the honorific?

171
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,070
Ah, that's right.

172
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,740
There is no need for you to die.

173
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,000
I am not the same person I was before.

174
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,330
You should be prepared to lose.

175
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,990
Yes!

176
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,970
What do you want if you win?

177
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,760
I would like another match!

178
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,620
It was a foolish question.

179
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,880
Let's begin, then.

180
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,770
1-5-1, marshal.

181
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,280
9-9-1, marshal.

182
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,710
7-9-1, pawn.

183
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,460
2-3-1, pawn.

184
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,900
2-7-2, musketeer.

185
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,560
Could it be?

186
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,580
7-1-2, fortress.

187
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,550
This is...

188
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,550
Marshal

189
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,480
...kokoriko?

190
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,050
Komugi, do you mean to mock me?

191
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,510
No.

192
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,170
I want a sincere answer.

193
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,650
I will not allow you to fool around.

194
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,060
Yes, I have never fooled around
while playing Gungi.

195
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,070
Very well.

196
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,400
If you lose, you will die.

197
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,490
Yes.

198
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,540
Certain Death

199
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,770
Is she saying this will not
mean her certain death?

200
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,600
She had a number of other options.

201
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,370
But all would only serve to lengthen the

202
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,680
game without increasing her chances.

203
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,150
If she thinks she has a chance to win...

204
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,060
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.

205
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,320
I want to see

206
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,060
where this goes!

207
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,130
4-6-2, spy.

208
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,330
Th-This is...

209
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,400
She

210
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,840
has found a way out.

211
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,570
That night, I realized something.

212
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,490
Quiet!

213
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,990
Let me think.

214
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,110
Here.

215
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,110
This is the only way to go!

216
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,520
I should be able to checkmate her!

217
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,280
When she's forced closer to my position,
my advantage grows with each move.

218
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,840
But if she slows down and allows
me a turn to attack,

219
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,110
she can't stop the knight
and lieutenant general!

220
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,630
2-6-1, knight!

221
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,760
I reversed her new move!

222
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,630
What now?

223
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
What is wrong?

224
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,420
Why do you cry?

225
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,240
Am I...

226
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,150
Am I allowed

227
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,400
to be so happy?

228
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,350
Can...

229
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,660
Can so many

230
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,660
wonderful things happen to someone like me?

231
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,170
I suppose I must tell you the truth.

232
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,290
I...

233
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,220
I have been poisoned,

234
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,930
and I have little time.

235
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,420
Meruem-sama...

236
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,730
Komugi, I wanted...

237
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,690
to spend my final moments
playing against you.

238
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,290
But this poison is contagious.

239
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,330
If you stay near me too long, you will also...

240
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,720
She reversed my reversal?

241
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,090
Meruem-sama...

242
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,960
Right now, I am very happy.

243
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,610
I may not be worthy,

244
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,300
but please allow me to join you.

245
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,000
I see...

246
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,740
I...

247
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,240
I believe

248
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,400
that I was born to be here today.

249
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,950
...was born for this moment.

250
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:27,930
Spy               Marshal

251
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,910
4-4-1, pawn.

252
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,140
6-5-1, knight.

253
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,080
2-7-2, new spy.

254
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,150
Komugi, are you still there?

255
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,760
Yes, I sure am.

256
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm not going anywhere.

257
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,730
4-5-1, lieutenant general.

258
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,290
That's checkmate.

259
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,000
Komugi, are you still here?

260
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,370
Yes, yes... Right here.

261
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,210
Let's play another match.

262
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,200
The loser goes first.

263
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,170
Komugi...

264
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,010
Yes, yes? What is it?

265
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,740
It appears I never defeated
you a single time.

266
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,640
What are you saying?

267
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,010
We've just gotten started!

268
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,410
Yes...

269
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,490
1-5-1, marshal.

270
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,670
9-5-1, marshal.

271
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,200
Komugi, are you still here?

272
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,520
Yes, of course.

273
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,090
It's your turn, Meruem-sama.

274
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,410
I'm a little tired...

275
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,800
I need to take a short nap.

276
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,050
Will

277
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,360
you hold my hand?

278
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,960
Komugi?

279
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,810
Komugi, are you there?

280
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,250
I can hear you.

281
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
I understand.

282
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,930
Like this?

283
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,070
I'll wake up shortly.

284
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,390
Will you stay by my side until I wake?

285
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,390
I've never left your side.

286
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,800
I'll always be here.

287
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,470
Komugi...

288
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,260
Yes, yes? What is it?

289
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,100
Thank you.

290
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,540
You're welcome.

291
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,230
Will you call me...

292
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,840
Yes?

293
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,260
...by my name one last time?

294
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,320
Good night,

295
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,640
Meruem...

296
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,810
I'll be joining you

297
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,810
soon.

298
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,390
Next time: Homecoming x And x True Name.

299
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm home, Mito-san!

300
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,520
Welcome home, Reina-chan.

301
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,950
Eh? What?!
