00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,200
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,560
Gon,

23
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,060
we need to learn more about Nen.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,990
Yeah!

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,820
An x Empty x Threat

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,870
After two months, during which Gon
was forbidden to practice Nen,

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,240
Wing has summoned Gon
and Killua to see him.

28
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,090
Gon-kun. Killua-kun.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,680
Starting today, you'll train with Zushi.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,880
Gon-kun, I'm pleased

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,100
that you kept your word.

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,210
It's thanks to your promise thread.

33
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,850
A few times, I almost gave in.

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,060
But when I looked at the thread,

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,610
I was able to control myself.

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,280
That's because I added some Nen to help you.

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,740
Huh? Really?

38
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,990
No, I was lying.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,490
Huh?

40
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,330
But how could you tell that he kept his word?

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,790
He could have been practicing in secret.

42
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,500
Because the promise thread remained intact.

43
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,110
Gon-kun, it's been a while,
but would you try using Ten ?

44
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,040
It's okay?

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,010
Yes.

46
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,510
Crap, do I remember how to do this?

47
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,590
It's been so long.

48
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,770
Can I still pull it off?

49
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,620
Zushi, what do you think?

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,620
I-It's amazing!

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,530
His aura is flowing all around him!

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,840
Soft and calm...

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,720
But it's very strong!

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,980
I did it!

55
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,210
Whew...

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,050
I was worried that I might
have forgotten how.

57
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,080
Once you've learned the technique,
you can't forget it.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,930
However, to become a master,

59
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,300
you'll have to train hard.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,900
But it felt easier than before,

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,690
despite not having been practicing Ten.

62
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,310
That's because

63
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,390
you were training your spirit each day.

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,690
Now, look at your left hand.

65
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,480
Huh?

66
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,550
It snapped!

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,800
By applying my own Nen,
I tied the thread such that

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,930
if you broke your promise and used Nen,

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,450
it would snap.

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,750
That's actually possible?

71
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,030
Hey, Wing-san...

72
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,960
Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?

73
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,840
Yes, I did.

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,900
What was the ability that Hisoka used?

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,460
Could we send loose limbs flying around?

76
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,930
Hmm, that's a difficult question.

77
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,470
Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,690
No, not yet.

79
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,230
Then I'll explain while we watch.

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,910
Can you see the threads of aura
extending from his left hand?

81
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,370
Threads of aura?

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes.

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,870
Do you see them?

84
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,170
N-Nope.

85
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,050
I can't see a thing.

86
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,380
Same here.

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,840
Are there really threads of aura

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,640
coming from Hisoka's left hand?

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,450
Yes, Hisoka is using a technique

90
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,900
that makes his aura difficult to perceive.

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Null

92
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,400
It's a high-level application of Zetsu, known as In.

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,400
Hide

94
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,000
When you use In,

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,900
even the strongest opponents will
find it hard to see your aura.

96
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,900
The most effective counter to this technique

97
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,950
Enhance

98
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,370
is to focus the aura created by Ren

99
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,790
into your eyes, a technique called Gyo.

100
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,790
Focus

101
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,440
The method Gon-kun used
in his fight with Gido

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,230
might work, as well.

103
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,270
However, you couldn't take offensive action,

104
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,380
so ultimately, you'd throw your life away.

105
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,680
Right.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,940
My assignment for you two

107
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,440
is to practice Ren until you
can see through Hisoka's In.

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,250
Eh?

109
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,250
Uh, master?

110
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,140
What should I do?

111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,240
Zushi,

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,150
you should already be strong
enough to see past his In.

113
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,730
I should?

114
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,110
Show them your Ren.

115
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,770
O-Osu!

116
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,010
Ren!

117
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,230
It's so strong.

118
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,730
It doesn't have a much greater magnitude,

119
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,930
but it's very dense.

120
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,950
Then direct that aura into your eyes.

121
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,930
Osu!

122
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Gyo!

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,200
So, can you see the aura that emanates

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,700
from Hisoka's body?

125
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,460
Yes.

126
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,470
And how many threads are there?

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
Twelve...

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,720
No, I think it's thirteen.

129
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,500
Not quite.

130
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,470
But you were close.

131
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,010
I could really see them!

132
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,670
You're making excellent progress, Zushi.

133
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,040
O-Osu...

134
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Thank you very much.

135
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,970
By channeling all your power through Gyo,

136
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,110
you achieved a level where you
could see through Hisoka's In.

137
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,130
But with enough training,

138
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,380
you'll be able to use Gyo while fighting.

139
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,610
Do you understand?

140
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,480
First, practice Ren,

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,830
and master the Ren application known as Gyo.

142
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,580
Then you'll discover the true nature

143
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,840
of Hisoka's ability.

144
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,030
And will you be able to use that same ability?

145
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,220
My answer is both yes and no.

146
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,470
Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,

147
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,480
so long as it uses Nen, you can learn it.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,450
However,

149
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,220
Nen powers depend on the
particular individual.

150
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,800
Each of us possesses different
specialties and preferences.

151
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,860
Thus, Nen differs for each person.

152
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,940
If you're serious about mastering Nen,

153
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,880
you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.

154
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
It's important that you first identify
your own strengths.

155
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,300
Strengths...

156
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,610
You've only just begun to develop.

157
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,510
You haven't settled on one form yet.

158
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,560
Initially, try to grow as much as you can.

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,640
That is the purpose of this training.

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,010
Train hard,

161
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,180
play hard, and enjoy life.

162
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,370
Osu!

163
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,870
The final day of Killua-kun's
window to fight is June 9th,

164
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,650
and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?

165
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,910
I'd like you both to register for your final day.

166
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,530
In the meantime, you'll train.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,540
You must learn Gyo
before it's time for your battle.

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,050
Osu!

169
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,890
Your Ren was impressive, Zushi.

170
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,550
You moved way ahead while I was resting.

171
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,280
No, I still have a long path before me.

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,680
Hey, let's practice what we just learned.

173
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,120
Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon.

174
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,930
Okay.

175
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,440
Killua... Zushi.

176
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,690
Osu!

177
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,950
We have company.

178
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,390
You guys don't know when to quit.

179
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,590
That's why no one likes you.

180
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,910
Oh, don't be so harsh.

181
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,250
Tell me when you're going to fight,

182
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,350
because I'd love to be your opponent.

183
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,110
I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.

184
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,470
They want to rack up wins
by beating us up.

185
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,190
We're getting desperate...

186
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,580
Because our deadline is nearing.

187
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,110
Come on, let's fight.

188
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I'll even demonstrate my power

189
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,720
right now.

190
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,910
I'm fighting on June 10th.

191
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,130
Hey, Gon!

192
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,060
That won't work.

193
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,630
My deadline is May 29th.

194
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,640
Fight on that day.

195
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,390
Who cares about your deadline, moron?

196
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,500
Let's go.

197
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,640
Gon-chan...

198
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,280
You and I will fight.

199
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,900
I guarantee it.

200
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,440
Gon, ignore him.

201
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,920
What will you do?

202
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,690
I'll force him to fight me.

203
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,500
Visualize the energy building in your body.

204
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,720
Power gathers in each cell, and grows.

205
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
Then you force that power

206
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,510
out!

207
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,550
I'm getting used to this.

208
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,030
Learning when to shroud the
boosted aura with Ten

209
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,550
was a little tricky.

210
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,030
A-A little?

211
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,280
They pick it up too fast!

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,290
But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.

213
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,820
Guess we should practice more.

214
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,250
N-No, that's enough!

215
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,450
Learning when to rest is part of training.

216
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,560
Let's call it a day.

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
Really? I can still—

218
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,420
No!

219
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,650
If they pass me in half a day,
I'll lose all my motivation...

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,120
Oh...

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,330
Well, it's okay.

222
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,810
We'll practice more tomorrow.

223
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,430
Yeah.

224
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,390
See you tomorrow.

225
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,490
Bye.

226
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay, then...

227
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,980
I can't...

228
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,980
I can't move!

229
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,880
I can't talk or breathe...

230
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,000
What's going on?

231
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,240
Oops.

232
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,040
Please...

233
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,930
Forget it.

234
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,830
I figured you were up to something.

235
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,900
But you don't need dirty tricks
to make me fight you.

236
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,920
When do you want to fight?

237
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
Don't worry.

238
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,550
I'll let you win.

239
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,030
I'll even give you each a win.

240
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,280
Is that good enough?

241
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,240
After I get my win off you,

242
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,790
I'm going to fight Gon-chan.

243
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,640
If you want to fight Gon,

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,960
you'll have to follow his schedule.

245
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,790
He'll be more than happy to fight you.

246
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,760
I can promise you that.

247
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,630
Okay.

248
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,080
If you two are willing to fight,

249
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,400
we don't need to bother with this.

250
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's go register together.

251
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,570
Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed.

252
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah, yeah. Sure...

253
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,270
But only this once.

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,950
May 29th...

255
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,830
Okay, happy now?

256
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes,

257
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,020
we'll return him.

258
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,670
Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal.

259
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,640
If you break your promise...

260
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,050
Eh... Whatever.

261
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,370
Forget it.

262
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,540
What? You got me curious.

263
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,900
What will happen if we break our promise?

264
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,470
No point in telling you now.

265
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,150
Just keep your word.

266
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,660
Hello? Is this Gon-kun?

267
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm sure you'll understand what this means.

268
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,090
As long as you don't tell anyone,
and you follow my instructions,

269
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,350
the three of you will be able to
train as usual tomorrow.

270
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,990
Zushi...

271
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,740
How did it go with Gon-chan?

272
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,050
Perfect.

273
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,290
He's registered for the 30th.

274
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,920
That's two wins.

275
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,370
Too easy.

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,880
Not killing people is pretty hard.

277
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,530
Clean living's tough...

278
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,770
Come on down! We have tickets!

279
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,770
These are fresh off the press...

280
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,380
Gon versus Sadaso!

281
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,030
And here's Killua versus Sadaso...

282
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,050
If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!

283
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,040
Pops.

284
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,910
Yep?

285
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,190
Does Sadaso have only one arm?

286
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,170
Yeah, the one-armed fighter,
with the mask-like face.

287
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,000
If he catches you with his
invisible left arm, you're finished.

288
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,920
They call him the newbie crusher...

289
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,380
That bastard.

290
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,430
Huh? Killua?

291
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,310
Gon, you were here?

292
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,690
Y-Yeah...

293
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,740
Killua-kun,

294
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,210
I believe you helped Zushi last night.

295
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,190
Thank you.

296
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,140
You feeling all right?

297
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,190
I was probably tired.

299
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,210
Sorry to worry you!

300
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,520
Oh, Wing-san...

301
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,450
Can we watch that video again?

302
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,210
I've learned how to use Gyo.

303
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,210
Really?

304
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,140
Fifteen threads, right?

305
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,500
Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf,

306
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,600
and a well hidden one that
leads to the arm he tossed.

307
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,490
Continue.

308
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,220
Hisoka is...

309
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,610
Hisoka's aura appears

310
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,990
to expand and contract.

311
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,870
Or does it

312
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,760
attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?

313
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
Why else would his arm reattach?

314
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,250
Or fly into his opponent's chin?

315
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,930
It's probably the former.

316
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,640
His aura is elastic, like rubber.

317
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,390
That would explain most of his tricks.

318
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,900
He's on a completely different level!

319
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,600
Very good... You pass.

320
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,490
But I am surprised...

321
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,130
I didn't expect you both to learn Gyo overnight.

322
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,260
Gon?

323
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,830
Uh-huh,

324
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,260
but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power.

325
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,620
So, Killua-kun,

326
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,010
since you finished your assignment,
I assume you want to fight, yes?

327
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,190
O-Oh, I wasn't trying to
beat you to the punch.

328
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,180
I just got an itch to fight.

329
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,310
Yeah, I get it.

330
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,560
Gon, they must have threatened you.

331
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,440
Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight.

332
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,610
May 29th.

333
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,590
Mine's May 30th.

334
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,710
That's fine.

335
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,410
I underestimated how fast you could learn.

336
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,370
Spend the remaining days practicing Ten and Ren.

337
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,420
Be sure you get plenty
of practice, rest, and sleep.

338
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,860
Osu!

339
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,940
Killua...

340
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,760
They must have threatened you.

341
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,660
Now I'm mad...

342
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,150
Yeah, but my biggest concern

343
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,720
was the master, and he agreed.

344
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,860
But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.

345
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,110
It'll be okay.

346
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,490
You don't need to worry.

347
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,050
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.

348
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,870
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.

349
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,870
Then I just need to find three more chumps.

350
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,530
And I'll be a Floor Master.

351
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,510
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.

352
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,060
Move, and I will kill you...

353
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,740
Use Nen, and I will kill you.

354
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,760
Make a sound, and I will kill you.

355
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,620
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.

356
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,820
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?

357
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,020
If you know, slowly open your eyes.

358
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,560
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.

359
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,990
Never show your filthy face to us again.

360
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,430
That's a promise.

361
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,930
Time has run out for Sadaso!

362
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,390
Killua wins by default!

363
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,970
Damn, I want my money back!

364
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,400
Killua opens the battle
against the persistent trio

365
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,150
with a win by default.

366
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,220
Thanks to their inborn talent,

367
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,140
Gon and Killua are learning Nen
at incredible speeds.

368
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,350
Now they will start the real battle

369
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,580
at Heavens Arena.

370
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

371
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

372
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

373
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

374
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

375
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

376
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

377
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

378
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:19,330
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

379
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,700
Today, we introduce Sadaso.

380
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,580
A Heavens Arena
200s-class warrior.

381
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,080
He underwent the traditional greeting

382
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,050
with Gido and Riehlvelt.

383
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,620
Alters his Nen to form
an invisible left arm.

384
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,740
Yeah?

385
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,070
His invisible left arm is made of Nen.

386
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,780
Yeah?

387
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,270
Oh.

388
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,870
Yeah?

389
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,720
Next time: Power x To x Avenge!

390
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,910
Power, yeah?

391
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,840
Avenge, yeah?

392
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,770
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
