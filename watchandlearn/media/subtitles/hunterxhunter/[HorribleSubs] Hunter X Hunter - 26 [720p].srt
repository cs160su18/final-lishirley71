2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,360
Then x And x After

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,110
"Dear Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?

11
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm doing great, as always.

12
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,320
So, I actually passed the Hunter Exam.

13
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,130
While I managed to pass the exam,

14
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm not too happy about it.

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,220
That's because of what happened
during the Final Phase."

16
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,680
You really don't get it...

17
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,230
If you die, you'll never get another chance.

18
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,450
If I kill you here,

19
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,820
I need only try again next year.

20
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,610
We are not on equal footing!

21
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,120
You value your pride more
than your own life?!

22
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
You're really willing to die for your pride?!

23
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm going to find my dad.

24
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,490
My dad is a Hunter.

25
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,590
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!

26
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,970
I believe that I'll find him one day...

27
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,450
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,

28
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,490
I'll never find him!

29
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,460
So I won't surrender.

30
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,990
If you don't yield, you'll die...

31
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,410
He defies reason.

32
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,920
I give up. You win.

33
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,800
That's not fair!

34
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,050
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!

35
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,810
You fool!

36
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,060
"He knocked me out.

37
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,810
So Satotz-san had to tell me

38
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,730
what had happened next."

39
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,900
Begin!

40
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,570
It's been too long, Kil.

41
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,390
Brother...

42
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,360
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

43
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,720
You were born to be...

44
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,370
a killer.

45
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,280
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?

46
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,310
True,

47
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't desire to become a Hunter.

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,520
But...

49
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,670
I do have something I want...

50
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,750
You don't.

51
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,890
I do!

52
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,010
There's something I really want!

53
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,550
Tell me what it is that you want.

54
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,020
I want to become friends with Gon...

55
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm sick of killing people...

56
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,670
I want to become friends with Gon,

57
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,190
and to live a normal life...

58
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,080
That's impossible.

59
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,620
You'll never be able to make friends.

60
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,500
Because you have the soul of a killer.

61
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,760
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,130
And if our bodies make contact,

63
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,520
that will also mean the fight has begun.

64
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,100
If you don't fight me,

65
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,230
your dear Gon will die.

66
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,550
I surrender.

67
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,370
I lose...

68
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,760
"Killua gave in to his despair after that."

69
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,060
Apologize to Killua!

70
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,950
Apologize? For what?

71
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,200
You don't know what you did wrong?

72
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't bother apologizing.

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
Just take me to see Killua.

74
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,530
What will you do then?

75
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,560
That should be obvious...

76
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm gonna rescue Killua!

77
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,160
"After that, Kurapika, Leorio, and I

78
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,120
went to Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua lives."

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,730
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.

80
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,080
Anyone who cannot open this gate

81
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,330
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,590
Listen to me, Gon-kun.

83
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,550
You three are allowed to work together

84
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,350
to open the door.

85
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,600
With a little training, it should be possible.

86
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,480
Let's do this, Kurapika!

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,940
Right, let's push!

88
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,280
Here we go!

89
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,280
One!

90
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,280
Two!

91
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,150
Three!

92
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,140
Ow...

93
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,660
It opened.

94
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,410
Yes!

95
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,140
We did it, Gon!

96
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,430
Uh-huh!

97
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,680
Leave.

98
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,440
You're trespassing on private property.

99
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,940
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.

100
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,510
If you take one step beyond this line,

101
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,940
I'll remove you by force.

102
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,200
What's the problem?

103
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,950
I'm just here to see my friend.

104
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm just here to see Killua!

105
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,500
Why do I have to do this?!

106
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,140
You're different from Mike.

107
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,400
You may try to hide your feelings,

108
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,890
but you have a heart.

109
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,270
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.

110
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,660
Please...

111
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,580
Help Killua-sama—

112
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,310
You must be Gon.

113
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,890
I heard about you from Illumi.

114
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,640
Killua knows that you're here.

115
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,020
Why can't Killua come see us?

116
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,520
Because he's in solitary confinement.

117
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,820
Solitary confinement?

118
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,070
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.

119
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,610
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.

120
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,830
I will take you

121
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,830
to the butler's office.

122
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:55,070
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.

123
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,980
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...

124
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,560
Well? Which hand?

125
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,800
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.

126
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,060
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.

127
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,980
In all honesty,

128
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,940
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.

129
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,000
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.

130
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,710
Should you all be disqualified,

131
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,800
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.

132
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,590
And that he will never see you again.

133
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,480
Here I go.

134
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,550
One second!

135
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,540
What is it?

136
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,390
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.

137
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,230
That's it...

138
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,020
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.

139
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,610
Okay!

140
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,770
Now I can see.

141
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,910
Give me your best!

142
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,380
Who now holds the coin?

143
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
The person right behind me.

144
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,450
Brilliant.

145
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,270
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?

146
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,290
Killua!

147
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,460
Oh! You're here, Gon!

148
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,080
Along with...

149
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,990
Kurapika?

150
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,510
I'm just an afterthought?

151
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,660
Liorio!

152
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,240
Leorio!

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,220
It's been a while.

154
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,490
I can't believe you came.
What happened?

155
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,790
Your face is a wreck!

156
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,910
Yours isn't any better!

157
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,540
"And just like that,

158
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,290
we managed to rescue Killua.

159
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,540
However, there is one more piece

160
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,350
of business I must take care of, Mito-san."

161
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:20,150
Hunter Vocabulary

162

Alphabet

163
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,740
"The business I still need to take care of

164
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,800
is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase."

165
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,710
I will need you to draw lots.

166
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,270
Lots?

167
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,460
For what?

168
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,220
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.

169
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,720
Listen carefully!

170
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,220
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,980
Your own ID is also worth three points.

172
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,730
All other ID tags are worth one point.

173
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,860
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.

174
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,860
So while on Zevil Island,

175
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,640
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.

176
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,880
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.

177
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,340
What number did you draw?

178
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,490
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?

179
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,850
Okay!

180
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,850
Ready, and...

181
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,340
#44 is...

182
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,360
Seriously?

183
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,740
In a straight-up fight,

184
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,110
I wouldn't stand a chance.

185
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,800
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,

186
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,810
then I have a real shot.

187
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,290
Yeah.

188
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,590
I might actually have a chance.

189
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,800
That scares me a little...

190
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,200
But I think it's worth it.

191
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,610
Now!

192
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,460
I did it!

193
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,580
I figured it out!

194
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,590
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!

195
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,960
There!

196
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,460
At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.

197
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,750
I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...

198
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,030
Over there!

199
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,780
I've gotta hurry.

200
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,790
Hisoka will attack,

201
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,850
as soon as he notices that guy.

202
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,600
This is my chance to steal his tag...

203
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,510
My last chance!

204
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,130
I have to conceal my presence, too.

205
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,380
Completely conceal my...

206
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,970
presence.

207
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,280
Here he comes!

208
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,530
Hisoka!

209
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,780
Damn... Bring it!

210
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,300
I did it...

211
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,500
I took Hisoka's tag!

212
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Approximately, seven thousand.

213
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,220
Do you know what that
number represents?

214
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,730
The number of chances
I had to kill you.

215
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,910
It's also the number of times you swung

216
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,700
your fishing rod when you were training.

217
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,490
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.

218
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,560
So long.

219
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,840
Damn it...

220
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
You surprise me.

221
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,010
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?

222
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,690
Waiting for me to attack another?

223
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,800
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?

224
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,370
Marvelous...

225
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,560
Like a wild animal.

226
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,440
And your timing was impeccable.

227
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,040
You concealed all traces of your attack

228
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,960
by timing it with my own attack.

229
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,030
A splendid job.

230
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,440
Wait...

231
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,220
Didn't you come to take back your tag?

232
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,220
No, I just came to commend you.

233
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,020
You owe me one now.

234
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,310
Feel free to pay me back when you want.

235
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,710
Goodbye.

236
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,160
I don't want to owe anyone...

237
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,080
You can have it back now.

238
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,210
I refuse.

239
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,210
Right now, I'm letting you live.

240
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,720
And I'll continue to keep you alive,

241
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,720
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

242
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,660
I'll only take it back

243
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,490
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

244
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,490
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

245
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,740
"It's the first time I've ever
felt that frustrated.

246
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,070
So I need to find a way to return the favor.

247
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,450
I can't return to Whale Island
until that's done.

248
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,890
That's why I'll be going to
Heavens Arena with Killua,

249
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,640
to train as a Hunter.

250
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,870
Please take care until I get back.

251
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,900
Gon Freecss."

252
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,440
I didn't expect him home anytime soon.

253
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,800
He really is your son...

254
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,080
Are you watching over him,

255
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,200
Ging?

256
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,840
Next time: Arrival x At The x Arena!

257
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,010
Off we go!

258
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,930
Gon Gon!

259
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,290
Again?
