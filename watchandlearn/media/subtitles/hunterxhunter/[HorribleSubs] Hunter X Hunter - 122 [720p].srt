2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,070
I can no longer think of him...

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,980
as a target to destroy.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,760
He acknowledged our efforts.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,390
He wasn't a bad guy.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,100
In that case, I no longer have...

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,030
any reason to defeat him.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,000
The King...

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,000
The soldiers are not important.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,980
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.

11
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,010
Pose x And x Name

12
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,730
This is an area used for testing weapons of war.

13
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,550
We won't need to restrain ourselves.

14
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,480
Why do you fight?

15
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,490
You have no chance of defeating me.

16
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,220
Why rush to your death?

17
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,350
You presume to know I cannot win?

18
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,120
You know nothing about me.

19
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,800
If you judge me by my appearance,

20
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,200
you'll get burned.

21
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,260
You have it backwards.

22
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,470
You don't seem like some ordinary man
who can't read the state of the battle.

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,940
I was born to rule this world.

24
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,400
Originally, you humans were as
no more than livestock to me.

25
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,530
But I have changed my mind.

26
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,720
I learned that there are a few
humans worth keeping alive.

27
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,000
Like that woman.

28
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,000
I sense that you are worthy, as well.

29
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,590
If you back down now,

30
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,030
I am willing to spare your life.

31
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,890
You'll only spare my life, yes?

32
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,880
Given my position,

33
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,990
I can't accept that offer.

34
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,000
Meanwhile...

35
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,640
In exchange for his agreement to stay still,

36
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain
just what had happened.

37
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,430
Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling
him what happened after the attack.

38
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,990
In other words, everything since
they'd been separated.

39
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,160
Pitou made it a point to include
details that Gon did not know,

40
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,240
to ensure that Gon's attention would
be focused on the explanation.

41
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,930
Pitou deliberately did not mention
how the King had held Komugi

42
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,890
because Pitou did not know how to
describe the events accurately.

43
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,240
There was no significant change in Gon.

44
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,660
However...

45
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,470
Pitou knew the plan had succeeded
when Gon's eyes wavered briefly.

46
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,620
The King...

47
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,050
left with the enemy of his own
volition, by that doorway.

48
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
There is no need for us to go.

49
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,310
I see.

50
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,320
He went south.

51
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,570
I understand.

52
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,620
A fine play, Pitou.

53
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,530
Then we should await the King's return here.

54
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,830
To maintain only my outward appearance,
I only need one-seventh of my flies.

55
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,430
The other six-sevenths

56
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,720
will go to the King!

57
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,970
You fight with the resolve to lose?

58
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,750
I do not understand.

59
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,000
You fight for the human race?

60
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,880
If so, then know that my actions
are, in fact, for their benefit.

61
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,310
For example, in human society,

62
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,700
lands are divided by national borders,
much like territorial marking.

63
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,380
On the right side of the border,
children may starve to death.

64
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,050
While on the left, scum who do nothing
have everything they need.

65
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,120
Absolute madness.

66
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,910
I shall crush that madness...

67
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,370
And create a world so fair,

68
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,300
the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!

69
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,180
I concede that

70
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,950
I will initially use power and terror
to accomplish my objective.

71
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,820
But I will only do so to the extent
necessary to maintain order.

72
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,070
I have learned what power
is meant to be used for.

73
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,440
To protect the weak,

74
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,040
who deserve to live.

75
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,550
Power is not meant to be used
to torment the defeated!

76
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,190
This could be a problem...

77
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,750
I shall not fight you.

78
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,710
I agreed to leave the palace

79
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,790
so we could have a free, open discussion.

80
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,160
He's wavering...

81
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,700
Come closer.

82
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,870
Wavering between Ant and human.

83
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,220
And he hasn't realized

84
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,940
that those two sides are incompatible.

85
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,820
And neither one

86
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,510
is dominant yet.

87
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,140
But regardless of which side he falls to,

88
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,010
the outcome won't change.

89
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,490
We're counting on you.

90
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,650
You have a single mission.

91
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,370
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.

92
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,170
There have already been many casualties.

93
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,330
We will use any means necessary.

94
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,880
Will that be acceptable?

95
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,880
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.

96
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,570
We simply desire

97
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,230
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.

98
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,110
Understood.

99
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,860
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association

100
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,300
to take the blame.

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,370
I must make this fast...

102
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,330
Before my heart is swayed.

103
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,970
King...

104
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,280
We are both in difficult positions.

105
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,960
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva

106
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,960
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!

107
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,460
First Hand

108
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,770
First Hand!

109
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
That's...

110
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,950
I can't sense anyone else fighting.

111
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,410
Does that mean I'm the only one left?

112
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,440
Youpi!

113
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,440
Pouf!

114
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,480
You've changed a lot since I last saw you.

115
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,800
I could say the same to you.

116
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,890
I had to escape without alerting the enemy.

117
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,940
And if I move all my dispersed particles
at once, it's too conspicuous.

118
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,040
So I must go slowly.

119
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,290
I'm sure you're feeling impatient,
but please spare me a moment.

120
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,270
I need to tell you what's happening.

121
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,920
Well, I suppose you have your own concerns...

122
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,190
You've grown up.

123
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,780
And there you have it.

124
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,880
I have no conclusive proof

125
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,690
that the change in Pitou will
actually benefit the King...

126
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,780
Through his own experiences,
Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior.

127
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,400
Youpi...

128
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,920
What do you think we should do?

129
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,110
This was a test.

130
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,330
Which made it very clear to Youpi

131
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,120
that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes

132
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,290
Pitou and Youpi had undergone.

133
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,500
A foolish question.

134
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,510
We must go

135
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,310
to the King at once!

136
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,470
And that's all there is to it... Right?

137
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,530
His response was entirely sincere.

138
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,480
Indeed.

139
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,780
He was concerned only with
leaving as soon as possible.

140
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.

141
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm sure that was a direct hit...

142
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,210
He's tough!

143
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,110
A good attack.

144
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,310
I could not anticipate it.

145
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,390
Are you satisfied now?

146
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
He still wants me to sit with him?

147
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,870
I shall not repeat myself.

148
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,440
Third Hand

149
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,990
Third Hand!

150
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,880
I can no longer back down!

151
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,110
Are you really so eager to die?

152
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,980
From the King's perspective,

153
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,130
the wrath that was unleashed

154
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,360
was no stronger than that
of a child throwing a fit.

155
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,740
Yet it was violent enough to induce
Netero to more than double the distance

156
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,520
between the King and him.

157
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,870
It was an insult likened to laughing off

158
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,460
Netero's declaration that

159
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,610
he would not back down.

160
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,830
Come on...

161
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,260
You will only influence me by using words.

162
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,270
Damned newborn brat.

163
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,910
If it were that simple,
I wouldn't have to do this!

164
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,010
Wait...

165
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
By using...

166
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,520
words?

167
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,990
King...

168
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,350
Would you like to know your name?

169
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,230
How would you know my name?

170
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,260
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

171
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,980
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

172
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,360
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

173
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,410
Interested in fighting me now?

174
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,750
If you can force me to admit defeat,

175
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,190
I will tell you your name.

176
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,590
Force you to admit defeat

177
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,240
without killing you?

178
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,530
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

179
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,780
No matter.

180
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,980
I shall checkmate you shortly.

181
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,500
The real battle between Netero
and the King has begun.

182
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,560
Next time: Centipede x And x Memory.

183
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,020
Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?

184
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,460
Uh, what do you want to be?

185
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,140
In my next life, I want to be me,
and meet you again.

186
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,240
Stupid!
