2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,510
If you lose,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,480
I shall take your left arm.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,230
Well... Instead of my left arm...

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,400
What?

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,490
What do you bet?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,500
My life.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,130
Your life, was it?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,000
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,980
Accept this apology.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,240
So this is it?

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,510
Our golden opportunity?

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,360
Yes...

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,600
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.

16
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Knov x And x Morel

17
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,300
Neferpitou has stopped

18
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,090
using En, in order to heal the King's injury.

19
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,840
Knov takes this opportunity
to infiltrate the palace.

20
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,750
Finally, I've gotten this close.

21
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,010
Still more than one hundred meters
to the central stairway.

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,780
These strange trees bear very large fruit.

23
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,160
Around five hundred per tree...

24
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,910
And there are ten trees.

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,290
A total of five thousand.

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,760
Five hundred thousand people were to undergo

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,290
the selection process each day,
with a one-percent survival rate.

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,550
But thanks to Killua's distractions,
that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,700
so the numbers add up...

30
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,560
These are cocoons holding the
humans who were selected.

31
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,160
Which means they will become Nen-wielding
human weapons at the King's disposal,

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,060
turning against the rest of humanity.

33
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,090
Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...

34
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,080
and intends to manipulate these
soldiers per the King's will,

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,460
expanding his conquest throughout the world.

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,830
I will not let that happen!

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,830
First, the far exit... is set.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,840
Next...

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,340
I must get closer.

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,840
The palace entrance looks dark...

41
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,220
So far, so good...

42
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,840
Middle exit... set.

43
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,300
Now for the near exit.

44
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,370
There aren't any guards...

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,870
I'd imagine only a select few are inside.

46
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,770
This will work.

47
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,540
If I've come this far,
I can reach the inner palace.

48
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,780
The throne room is on the third
floor, at the rear and center.

49
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,200
King

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
We must delay any reinforcements,
even if by only a second.

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,160
Central Stairway

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,700
The first floor is too far for that.

53
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,270
The central stairway, second floor.

54
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,640
That's the best location!

55
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,160
The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...

56
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,220
To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...

57
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,340
No, that would be no different
from the one outside...

58
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,380
It should at least

59
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,210
be next to the first floor's central stairway.

60
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,570
Then, if I can, I'll go up from
there to the second floor...

61
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,100
Window Opener
Scream

62
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,100
Scream...

63
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,270
Close!

64
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,840
Are any others around?

65
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,800
If I'm seen, it's over.

66
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,720
I'll have to retreat...

67
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,590
Nothing's coming?

68
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,970
Then it was alone?

69
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,630
This is it.

70
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,510
I can't move beyond this point...

71
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,090
If I do, I'll be killed.

72
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,150
What is that aura?

73
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,270
It appears to be full of all
kinds of misfortune...

74
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,760
At this point, I don't fear death.

75
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,290
What I fear is that,

76
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,280
before killing me,

77
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,480
the monsters up there

78
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,630
will squeeze every drop of information
from me that I have on the King...

79
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,040
Using any brutal means necessary.

80
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,520
If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...

81
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,040
The aura's strength

82
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,130
just confirms it...

83
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,210
This is as far as I go...

84
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,340
Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?

85
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,840
My name is Leol, and don't forget it.

86
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,090
I heard that I should expect
a crayfish and wolf.

87
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,350
They're dealing with the grunts you created.

88
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,100
So I can fight you one-on-one.

89
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,100
I appreciate that.

90
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,470
This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.

91
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,960
No, he's a little stronger.

92
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,610
Let's get started.

93
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,370
Right now, allowing Knov to get
into the palace is the priority.

94
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,370
Until that happens, I need to
divert the enemy's attention.

95
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,380
That won't help.

96
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,340
This is Marcos.

97
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you have the meat?

98
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,650
Yes, as requested.

99
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,000
Refrigerated trucks are entering
the underground warehouse...

100
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,160
They're shipping in food.

101
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,880
If the information Marcos
provided was accurate,

102
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,450
living women are also inside.

103
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,650
Not for the King, but for the
lecherous Secretary Bizeff.

104
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,300
If everything is going as planned,

105
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,370
Palm should be inside.

106
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,890
Leave the fourth truck as it is.

107
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes, sir.

108
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,950
Then we'll be leaving.

109
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,510
Area D, of the underground warehouse.

110
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,710
My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.

111
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,440
Now, please step out.

112
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,050
There's nothing to worry about.

113
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,810
From now on, you will work here.

114
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,220
I've prepared rooms for each of you.

115
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,270
You will be provided with all necessities.

116
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,110
In your spare time, you may do as you want.

117
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,330
As long as you don't attempt to escape.

118
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,690
Your only job

119
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,340
is to follow my orders.

120
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,110
When summoned, you must drop everything,

121
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,970
and come to see me at once.

122
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,410
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

123
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,730
Excellent.

124
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,400
You...

125
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,870
Come with me.

126
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes.

127
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,050
The rest of you can wait in your rooms.

128
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,550
Yes...

129
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,750
The Secretary was...

130
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,640
...interested in us!

131
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,150
I must find a way out of here,

132
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,760
so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.

133
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,280
Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe

134
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,860
the current whereabouts of
anyone she has seen previously.

135
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,250
This power will allow her to keep tabs
on the King and Royal Guard.

136
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,090
The Hunters will then be able to determine

137
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,210
the optimal route for the operation.

138
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,390
Only one exit.

139
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,850
I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.

140
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,850
My mission is crucial for
increasing our chances

141
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,810
of defeating the King!

142
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,680
What matters most isn't that I succeed...

143
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,320
But that, should I fail and be captured,
I kill myself immediately.

144
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,570
I should be safe here...

145
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,480
Palm...

146
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,030
Don't do anything foolish!

147
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,290
I managed to place the exits,

148
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,950
so even if your mission doesn't succeed,
we can still execute the operation.

149
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,380
If you get caught, it's over...

150
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,540
That...

151
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,650
That...

152
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,890
That vicious aura...

153
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,160
One look

154
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,980
was all it took

155
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,550
to break my will...

156
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,900
Gon... Killua...

157
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,150
You must have seen that aura...

158
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,610
You were probably even closer,
actually touching it...

159
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,780
Yet...

160
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,360
How are you still able

161
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,580
to face them?

162
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,660
How can you bring yourself to fight?

163
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,530
Is it to save your friends?

164
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,590
To protect humanity?

165
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,440
Why...

166
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,030
Why are you still fighting?

167
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,630
Palm!

168
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,230
Please...

169
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,130
Don't do anything foolish.

170
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,230
I beg you...

171
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,850
If you're caught, it's all over...

172
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,120
Palm!

173
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,950
I won't be able...

174
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,250
to go back there...

175
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,910
I brought you something cold to drink.

176
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,840
You're dismissed.

177
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,370
Wait in your room.

178
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,150
Yes.

179
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,590
Your lack of familiarity with the
area has sealed your defeat.

180
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,540
Though it's almost too perfect that,
after all that running,

181
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,980
you ended up in an underground church.

182
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,770
In case of emergency, this place
is used as an air shelter.

183
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,440
An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.

184
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,220
Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.

185
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,490
I'm an atheist.

186
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,320
You're a cocky guy.

187
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,540
Let's see who's trapped whom.

188
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,500
Cheetu told me everything.

189
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,720
I hear you can mold that
smoke into various objects.

190
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,790
Knowing that, he still chased me in here?

191
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,730
Even better.

192
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,200
If he believes things are going his way,

193
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,240
he won't hesitate to display his abilities.

194
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,900
However,

195
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,470
I've yet to meet anyone whose power

196
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,740
allows them to react more
flexibly than Deep Purple.

197
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,510
I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.

198
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,250
Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...

199
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,590
I really dig it.

200
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,140
It's common sense to defeat an opponent
before they can use their power.

201
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,210
But that isn't how men

202
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,930
should fight.

203
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,240
Hey, what are you up to?

204
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,900
Voluntarily removing one of your senses?

205
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,410
Have you heard of the band Black Planet?

206
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,410
Their second album is super cool.

207
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
It's a twelve-song medley.

208
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,420
Listening to the whole thing's
like reading a good book.

209
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,310
When you finish it, you feel great.

210
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,680
I know.

211
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,010
And best part of all, the medley's
exactly sixty minutes long.

212
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,190
It's a masterpiece!

213
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,820
I hate to admit it, but I agree.

214
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,940
Rental, start!

215
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,170
This could be bad...

216
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,710
I have a hard time fighting

217
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,460
others who share my tastes.

218
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,910
Next time: Return x And x Retire.

219
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,040
Killua!

220
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,010
Return on.

221
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,680
Killua!

222
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,980
To the next episode preview!

223
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,390
It has to be you, Killua!

224
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,220
Hey, stop crying.
