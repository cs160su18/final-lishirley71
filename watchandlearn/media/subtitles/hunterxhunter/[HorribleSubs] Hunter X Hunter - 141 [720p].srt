00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,230
Wow!

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:17,110
You'll find footage of today's entire meeting—
the entire meeting—on the Hunter site,

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,750
so tell everyone who wasn't present!

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,000
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Magician x And x Butler

7
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,510
I will announce the results of the fourth vote
for the election of the 13th chairman.

8
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,850
Out of 661 Hunters,

9
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,350
there were 642 valid votes

10
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,480
and 19 absentees.

11
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,440
6) Ickshonpe — 26
7) Teradein — 21

25) Hanzo, 5 others — 2
28) Saiyu, 8 others — 1

12
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,550
The turnout was 97.1%.

13
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,990
4th Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 258 (39%)
2) Cheadle — 57
3) Leorio — 55
4) Botobai — 31
5) Mizaistom — 27

14
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,910
As the conditions were not met,
the vote must be redone.

15
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,750
1) Pariston
2) Cheadle
3) Leorio
4) Botobai

16
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,020
Voter turnout for the most recent vote in
the 13th chairman election exceeded 95%.

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,570
Which means that for the fifth vote,

18
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,120
we will have a runoff with the top sixteen
candidates, so keep that in mind.

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,730
I will now introduce the top sixteen
candidates in the order of votes received.

20
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,660
Please use this information when voting.

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,030

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,150

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,540

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,670

Advisor to the Zodiacs,

31
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,550
he was the closest to the chairman
in both reputation and reality.

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,340
Mizaistom Nana, a Double Star Crime Hunter.

33
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,710
The conscience of the Zodiacs,

34
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,060
his practical nature has earned the respect
of the anti-chairman faction.

35
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,420
Ickshonpe Katocha, a Single Star Hacker Hunter.

36
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,570
Living in the digital world, he has
yet to cast any votes himself.

37
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,520

After defeating the Ants,

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,590
His focus is preparation for the
arrival of more alien species.

45
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,310
Biscuit Krueger, a Double Star Gemstone Hunter.

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,040
The Association's mother figure...

47
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,890
Sorry, older sister.

48
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,780
More and more people want her to scold them.

49
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,800
Sanbica Norton, a Single Star Virus Hunter.

50
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
The Association's doctor,

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,330
she has asked that no one vote for her.

52
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,290
Linne Hors-d'oeuvre, a Double Star Gourmet Hunter.

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,280
The oldest Association Hunter,

54
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,750
it's been five years since anyone
has heard her speak.

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,050
Bushidora Ambitious, a Single Star Blacklist Hunter.

56
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,350
The Association's disciplinary officer,

57

contacts to missing persons.

60
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,520
He's tackling the issue of missing Hunters.

61
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,540

66
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,880
Is he back in the election
after receiving pity votes?

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,590
Leorio's in third?

68
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,430
That's incredible.

69
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,930
You can go to hell!

70
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,870
I guess this clip had a big impact...

71
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,630
And he has no problem using
his Nen in front of a crowd.

72
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,050
You can go to hell!

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,050
Looks like he's an Emitter.

74
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,580
So do people dislike Gon's dad?

75
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
That was a standing ovation.

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,360
Wow!

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
You'll find footage of today's entire meeting...

78
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,470
Master Illumi...

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,300
Yes, at once.

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,050
Please wait one moment.

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,990
Thanks to Gotoh,

82
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,240
I can see it now...

83
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,300
Our family's correlation chart surrounding Alluka.

84
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,660
Despite what he says, my father trusts me.

85
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,660
That's why Gotoh was allowed to accompany us,

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,740
and he won't force me to stop.

87
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,300
However, he's wary of Alluka's power.

88
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,120
Which makes sense, given that one wrong move

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,050
is all it takes for the entire family to die.

90
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,530
But on the other hand,
he wishes to control Alluka's power.

91
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,790
That dilemma shows in his decision to
lock her up in a room filled with toys.

92
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,300
That's why he had Tsubone and Amane,
his most trusted butlers, accompany us.

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,150
If something happens, they can
take us back immediately.

94
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,930
And he hopes they'll glean some hint
to help him control Alluka.

95
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Tsubone and Amane understand their role,

96
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,530
and they're being very cautious.

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,090
Gotoh and Canary are being subtle,

98
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,750
but they're on our side and helping us.

99
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,020
And then,

100
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,400
there's Illumi.

101
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,380
The moment his name was spoken,
Amane's tension spiked.

102
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,310
This means Amane and Tsubone,

103
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,230
and Father and Grandpa by extension,

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,920
disagree with Illumi.

105
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,520
I'd guess that Illumi's plans for Alluka are...

106
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,800
That was a fine play, Gotoh.

107
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,940
You threw out his name to see Amane's reaction.

108
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,600
If Tsubone were here,

109
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,180
she would have noticed Gotoh's reaction
when he answered the phone,

110
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,430
and she'd have distracted me or signaled
Amane to shut off her emotions.

111
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,830
This is an internal family struggle,

112
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
an inner mission.

113
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,610
When family members differ
in opinion or objective,

114
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,930
they're each encouraged to do things their
own way, rather than unite in the same goal.

115
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,590
This is a contest!

116
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,790
Father and Grandpa want Alluka
near, so they can control her,

117
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,980
and they don't want me hurt by her power.

118
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,020
I want

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,800
to save Gon

120
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,780
and to set Alluka free.

121
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,000
And...

122
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,560
Illumi wants

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,930
to kill Alluka!

124
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,130
Is this Killua?

125
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,750
Yeah.

126
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,270
You removed the needle, didn't you?

127
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,430
Yeah.

128
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,350
I feel a lot better.

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,770
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.

130
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,240
Kill?

131
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,060
Me?

132
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,400
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.

133
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,930
Family is off limits.

134
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Hey, hey, Amane...

135
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,310
Isn't this part great?

136
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,050
Why is this story so mysterious?

137
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,730
Is that what

138
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,570
Father meant?

139
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,030
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.

140
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,190
They're all thinking

141
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,490
the same thing!

142
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,050
Fine...

143
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,940
I'll beat you at your own game.

144
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,630
Then, let's begin.

145
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,290
Master Killua!

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,720
Don't let go of Master Alluka!

147
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,670
Yeah, I got her.

148
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,080
If you two are more than a meter apart,

149
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,290
Amane will capture Master Alluka,

150
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,430
and Tsubone will take you home by force!

151
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,980
Oh, dear.

152
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,990
That was excessive.

153
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
I thought you were going to ask him first.

154
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,150
I have a little bird who brings me information.

155
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,180
And after examining that information,

156
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,970
there's something that bothers me.

157
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,290
Killua is hiding rules from us.

158
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,750
If there are rules I don't know about,

159
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,990
trying to negotiate with him is pointless.

160
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,180
He might accede to my demands
because they favor him.

161
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,070
So I'll dispose of Alluka before he has
a chance to use that advantage.

162
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,230
I just need you to eliminate the butlers

163
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,580
while you look for a chance
to take Alluka from Killua.

164
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,200
For now.

165
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay.

166
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,600
By the way,

167
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,840
am I allowed to kill Killua?

168
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,240
I will

169
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,810
kill you.

170
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,150
Right here.

171
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,930
Right now.

172
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,530
I was kidding.

173
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,520
You're oozing bloodlust.

174
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,490
Is that all right?

175
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,780
Illumi's bloodlust!

176
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,140
Oh, damn.

177
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,300
Was that on purpose?

178
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,890
Certainly not.

179
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,430
If at all possible, I'd like Gon to live.

180
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,960
Having more toys is always more amusing.

181
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,380
Well,

182
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,980
only if it's possible.

183
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,960
It's okay. Brother's got you.

184
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,580
Keep your eyes closed and hold on tight.

185
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,840
Uh-huh.

186
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,590
Try to stay away from Master Illumi.

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,840
If he knows the route we're taking,
it's best to change directions.

188
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,350
I concur, but...

189
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,430
It's hard for me to agree with you.

190
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,710
My grandmother and I are not your enemies.

191
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,610
Not right now.

192
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,620
But that could change if my
father's mood changes.

193
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,790
Master Silva and Master Zeno
are not your enemies.

194
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,630
Our mission is to bring you home safely.

195
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,490
If that doesn't include Alluka,

196
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,640
you're all enemies.

197
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,630
Godspeed!

198
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,590
Speed of Lightning!

199
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,870
It's me. The situation's changed.

200
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,980
We've been separated from Master Killua.

201
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,130
We'll need four vehicles now.

202
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,820
We'll follow the same route.

203
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,120
If Master Killua contacts you,

204
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,040
follow his instructions, but avoid
any sensitive information.

205
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,670
Master Illumi is aware of our movements.

206
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,170
One of the butlers or a family
member is helping him.

207
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,620
Be sure to stay alert.

208
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,800
Understood.

209
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,860
Ah...

210
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,460
You've grown, Master.

211
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,690
If I hadn't known about that
technique beforehand,

212
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,210
I wouldn't have had time to react.

213
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,160
He will become an excellent assassin.

214
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,140
Oh, dear. These days, it doesn't
take much for me to tear up.

215
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,230
In that case, he won't let Master
Illumi get the better of him.

216
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,910
I shouldn't say that.

217
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,300
But I find it difficult to like Master Illumi

218
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,480
and Master Milluki, who resemble their mother.

219
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Now, then...

220
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,760
Time to set aside personal emotion.

221
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,490
If he breaks the rules, everything changes.

222
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,510
I need to devise a way to subdue Master Killua,

223
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,550
taking his speed into account.

224
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,050
Okay! We should be far enough
away to take a break.

225
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,860
I'd like to use Speed of Lightning to keep going,

226
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,640
but to be safe, I should save my
energy for getting into town.

227
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,770
Brother?

228
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,190
Am I a nuisance?

229
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,790
If I were gone, would everyone get along better?

230
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,180
Alluka.

231
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,300
If...

232
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,410
I were the only person in the
world who really loved you,

233
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,820
would you be sad?

234
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,550
I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling.

235
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,760
Okay?

236
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,370
I'll always be with you!

237
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,000
You don't need to worry about anyone else.

238
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,310
Someone's there.

239
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,870
Is it Tsubone?

240
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,460
Is it Illumi?

241
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,100
I guess this won't be easy.

242
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,370
That's fine!

243
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,270
Let's go.

244
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,160
Who are you?

245
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,130
A magician who wishes to stay anonymous.

246
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,920
You two

247
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,380
shouldn't be trying to fight back.

248
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,090
Just evade his attacks.

249
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,210
Save your energy for the mission at hand.

250
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,040
You should follow Master Killua.

251
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,470
I'll play with you.

252
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,730
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...

253
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,990
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.

254
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,300
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.

255
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,350
He must have used his power.

256
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,020
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.

257
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,520
Elastic Love
Bungee Gum

258
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,640
You've said too much.

259
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,280
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!

260
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,250
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.

261
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,530
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.

262
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,610
Hisoka and Gotoh

263
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,470
are about to engage in battle.

264
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,090
A barrage of coins.

265
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,460
A net of gum.

266
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,140
While a furious battle takes place,

267
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,760
Illumi pursues the fleeing Killua.

268
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,090
Next time: Needles x And x Debt.
