00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,830
Tonight, at 9 PM,

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,360
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,610
Ivlenkov,

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,610
Tocino,

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,610
and Baise,

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,240
you'll handle the bidding.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,680
What about the rest of us?

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,150
Basho and Linssen

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,240
will cover the rear entrance.

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,250
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,780
Squala and I will guard the lady.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,380
And with that,

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,010
the mission begins.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,050
A x Shocking x Tragedy

16
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,600
The Nostrade Family has
learned that someone

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,530
plans to attack the
underground auction run

18
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,290
by the Mafia community.

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Kurapika and the other bodyguards

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
have begun their assignments.

21
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,230
Everyone's here...

22
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,680
These are mostly Mafia leaders.

23
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,430
We even have some head honchos here.

24
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,220
I'm surprised.

25
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,880
Why?

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,190
It's only an auction...

27
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,230
They could send an agent.

28
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,070
Their honor's on the line.

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,710
For each winning bid,

30
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,120
five percent goes back into the
Mafia community as a commission.

31
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,040
Does that act as a bribe?

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,010
Like, the more they bid,
the more they'll receive?

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,330
Yeah,

34
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,670
that's how the Mafia flexes
its financial muscles.

35
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,300
So this is a chance to improve
their standings.

36
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,470
But some gangs have gone bust

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,590
because they overbid.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,300
It's about to start.

39
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,860
Okay...

40
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,510
Welcome, everyone.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,600
So, I'm skipping the formalities.

42
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,310
Die.

43
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,950
My Ambidextrous Automatic Weapons
Double Machine Gun

44
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,210
Get down!

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,180
Black Balloons!

46
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,580
Guard me.

47
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,210
Thankless Heroes
Eleven Black Children

48
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,810
Is he using Nen bullets?!

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
That means he's also an Emitter!

50
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,690
He'll break through my Nen barrier,

51
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,940
and pierce my body...

52
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,240
Each bullet packs an incredible punch!

53
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,370
Run!

54
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,620
Inform the boss—

55
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,220
Baise, you go ahead...

56
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,080
That was way too fast...

57
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,290
I didn't get to do anything.

58
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,260
All yours, Shizuku.

59
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,640
Let's go, Blinky.

60
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,400
Suck up the bodies, blood,

61
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,040
body parts, and all their possessions.

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,900
Grab the chairs, too.

63
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,870
Shizuku's Nen ability is always
entertaining to watch.

64
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,620
Oh?

65
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,100
Someone's still alive.

66
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,040
Wh-Who are you?

67
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,890
Doesn't matter.

68
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,060
You're all dead...

69
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,860
The community will

70
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,360
destroy you.

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,860
Your family!

72
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,990
Torture you... Cut you up.

73
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,760
You'll taste hell!

74
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,880
Family?

75
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,100
What's that?

76
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,140
I'm having difficulty hearing clearly,

77
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,190
but there's a real commotion
inside the building.

78
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,690
Something must have happened.

79
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,540
Contact the leader!

80
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,530
Got it.

81
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,820
I'll contact Linssen and Basho.

82
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,870
You two head inside!

83
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,330
Wha...

84
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,170
What?

85
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,570
There's no one here.

86
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,720
Where did they go?
Search the place!

87
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,710
Hey, what happened to
the merchandise?

88
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,720
Underground... Head underground, now!

89
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,630
It appears that everyone in the
auction house has disappeared.

90
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,550
What?

91
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,480
The whole place is in an uproar.

92
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,240
It's out of control.

93
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,500
What about the merchandise?

94
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,980
Melody is heading underground, to the safe.

95
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,990
I-It's empty...

96
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,840
The goods for today's auction
have been stolen!

97
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,490
Who did this?!

98
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,940
Damn!

99
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,520
Where'd they go?

100
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,250
Split up and search, fool!

101
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,890
Send word to every gang...

102
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,180
Quickly!

103
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay, understood.

104
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,260
We'll catch those thieves.

105
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,670
I'll head over.

106
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,350
Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho
behind the building, in Central Park.

107
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,620
Squala...

108
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,490
Yes?

109
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,450
Just in case, leave five dogs behind.

110
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,030
Right.

111
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,750
Listen up!

112
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't take your eyes off the boss!

113
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,060
Don't let anyone in the
room until we return.

114
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,040
Yes.

115
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,440
All roads are sealed.

116
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,790
The only remaining escape
route is by air!

117
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,080
If you see any suspicious
aircraft, contact me.

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
Make sure not to kill them.

119
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,060
The community has offered
a substantial reward to

120
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,110
the gang that captures the thieves.

121
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,160
You must take them alive!

122
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,810
There wasn't any merchandise?

123
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,190
No, the safe was empty.

124
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,170
According to the auctioneer,
the only one who knew the situation,

125
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,070
everything in the safe had been
moved a few hours earlier.

126
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,450
Exactly as though they
expected this to happen.

127
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,090
Don't you find the timing too perfect?

128
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,020
We have a...

129
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,130
Judas among us.

130
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,970
We have a Judas among us.

131
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,230
You're saying that one of us is a traitor?

132
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,580
There are no traitors.

133
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,740
Besides, Judas wasn't a traitor.

134
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,700
It's said that Judas sold Jesus out
for thirty pieces of silver.

135
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,750
But how much would a traitor ask

136
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,750
from the Mafia?

137
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,680
Consider the merits...

138
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,760
What would the traitor gain
by selling us to the Mafia?

139
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,510
Money?

140
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,020
Glory?

141
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,520
Prestige?

142
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,170
Do you truly believe

143
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,770
that any of us cares for those things?

144
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,200
It's unlikely...

145
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,220
You see?

146
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Besides, something else
here doesn't add up.

147
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,660
Huh?

148
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,520
Assuming there were a spy,

149
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,910
the response was too tepid.

150
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,440
If they had foreknowledge

151
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,550
that Class-A bounties would
appear at the auction,

152
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,180
they would have increased security.

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,900
The auction goers were all
uninformed and unarmed.

154
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,250
That's true.

155
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,190
I believe that someone

156
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,690
provided information
that wasn't explicit.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,520
However, a Mafia community leader

158
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,320
believed that information.

159
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't get it...

160
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,980
Who told who what?

161
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,310
Whatever.

162
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,710
So what do we do?

163
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,270
Did you ask the auctioneer

164
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,560
where the merchandise was moved?

165
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah, but

166
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,120
he swore on his life that he didn't know.

167
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
Feitan tortured him, so he wasn't lying.

168
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,860
He had the worst luck of them all today.

169
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,030
Did you get the names of
anyone who might know?

170
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,860
You bet I did.

171
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,660
The auction is run by the
Mafia community heads,

172
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,830
who lead gangs in each of the
ten districts around the world.

173
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,370
They're called the Ten Dons.

174
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,390
This is the only time that all
ten gather in one place,

175
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,380
to discuss business and issue orders.

176
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,150
Their commands are carried
out by a special force,

177
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,590
the Shadow Beasts.

178
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,500
This squad consists of each
don's best combatants.

179
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,450
I see, then...

180
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,110
Since the Shadow Beasts weren't
guarding the auction house,

181
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,110
the Mafia didn't know we were coming.

182
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,650
That makes sense.

183
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,030
Then how did they move
the merchandise?

184
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,570
That's right...

185
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,380
I heard that a single Shadow Beasts
member turned up at the safe.

186
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,860
The twenty-five square-meter
safe was packed with

187
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,640
items ready to be auctioned off.

188
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,410
The Shadow Beast walked in, then
walked right back out, empty-handed.

189
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,410
But the safe was emptied.

190
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,070
It was a man in sunglasses,
calling himself Owl.

191
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,860
He must possess a Nen power
similar to Shizuku's.

192
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,540
Probably.

193
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,530
Surely they noticed

194
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,540
after five hundred people disappeared...

195
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,040
That they're facing Nen users.

196
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,990
Can we let loose?

197
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,850
Naturally.

198
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,400
Put on a show for the pursuers.

199
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,900
That will draw them out.

200
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,660
I can't wait...

201
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,860
Up there!

202
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,330
It's them! They're in a hot air balloon!

203
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,250
The balloon is moving toward
the Gordeau Desert!

204
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,320
We're in pursuit!

205
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,040
Hot air balloon?

206
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,660
Not an airship?

207
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,830
Then what became of the
hundreds of guests?

208
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,750
It's possible that we aren't dealing

209
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,470
with an ordinary band of armed thugs.

210
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,610
Contact the Ten Dons.

211
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,130
Ask them to immediately
dispatch the Shadow Beasts!

212
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,990
Hurry, they're headed for
the Gordeau Desert.

213
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay!

214
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,540
Roger that.

215
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,300
Come down here!

216
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,880
We'll even let you decide whether
you'll be drowned or buried!

217
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,330
There's a whole crowd...

218
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,530
I don't have to suck them up, do I?

219
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,460
No, they don't matter.

220
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,640
Hey!

221
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,950
Stay out of this.

222
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,640
I'll handle it...

223
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,860
Wait!

224
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,330
Are you the ones who
kidnapped the guests?

225
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,160
Yeah.

226
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,300
Well, you do have guts.

227
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,420
Who's your leader?

228
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,920
Bastard.

229
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,120
His philosophy is

230
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,740
to be the strongest

231
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,000
of them all...

232
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,320
An ordinary gun wouldn't
even scratch him.

233
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,600
Physically, he's the strongest.

234
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,600
It's like watching a gorilla stomping ants.

235
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,310
Oh?

236
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,360
More of them.

237
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,020
They came all the way here,
merely to be killed.

238
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,780
Just watching isn't any fun.

239
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,320
Let's play cards.

240
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,210
Yes.

241
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,300
I agree.

242
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
Boss!

243
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,410
That wasn't enough to warm me
up for the Shadow Beasts.

244
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,530
Ow...

245
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,690
A rifle?

246
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,780
How annoying.

247
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,700
Trying to take me out from afar?

248
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,520
Yeah! Bull's-eye!

249
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,590
That's enough!

250
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Don't get too cocky, monster.

251
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,680
This super-bazooka is strong
enough to take out a tank.

252
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,290
You'll be blown to smithereens!

253
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,010
How sad...

254
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,690
You're comparing me
to some little tank?

255
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,190
Die!

256
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,870
Did I get him?

257
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,880
That kinda hurt...

258
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,890
None of you will escape!

259
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,390
It appears the enemy can use Nen...

260
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,780
And he's ridiculously strong.

261
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,880
The advance force was obliterated.

262
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,660
Guns are ineffective against him.

263
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,540
Impossible...

264
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,840
See for yourself.

265
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,410
His aura is unbelievable.

266
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,340
As is the number of corpses.

267
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,200
Who is that guy?

268
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,470
He's tearing through people
like scraps of paper.

269
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,070
We're supposed to capture him?

270
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,260
I won't be part of that!

271
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,650
I agree.

272
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,610
I don't see how we can win...

273
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,100
Indeed.

274
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,730
However, we cannot abandon
our mission and back off.

275
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,160
But...

276
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,880
Wait.

277
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,950
I suddenly hear an additional
heartbeat coming from somewhere...

278
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,380
I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.

279
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,890
Which group do you belong to?

280
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,720
We're bodyguards for
the Nostrade Family.

281
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,400
I see.

282
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,400
It seems that you can use Nen,

283
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,920
but don't bother.

284
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,400
These aren't ordinary thugs.

285
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,660
To them, taking lives is like breathing.

286
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,410
Y-You could say they're
professional killers.

287
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,610
And a pro knows his trade best of all.

288
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,860
Rabid Dog.

289
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,290
I'm Leech.

290
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,010
I-I'm Porcupine.

291
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,780
We Shadow Beasts will see to them.

292
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,770
These are the Shadow Beasts...

293
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,190
The Mafia community has
unleashed the Shadow Beasts

294
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,410
on the bandits who attacked the auction.

295
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,490
Kurapika still has yet to
realize that they are

296
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,710
facing off against the Phantom Troupe.

297
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

298
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

299
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

300
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

301
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

302
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

303
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

304
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

305
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:18,830
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

306
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,500
Today, we introduce Baise!

307
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,620
A Hunter hired as one
of Neon's bodyguards.

308
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,380
Her Nen ability is called Instant Lover.

309
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,030
She uses her charms to get close to men,

310
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,830
With Nen, she makes anyone she
kisses her slave for 180 minutes.

311
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,720
pretend she's into them, and kiss them!

312
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,380
Be careful, you men.

313
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,330
Next time: Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!

314
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,240
Excuse me, do bananas count as snacks?

315
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,380
Does chocolate count as a snack?

316
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,320
That's always been a snack!
