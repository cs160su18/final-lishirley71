2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,230
Right, it's so simple.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,710
I merely need to fix him.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,040
I only need the power to do that.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,340
The question is how we will manage to win.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,740
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,610
You're simply awful.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,170
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,170
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,170
Come on, what are you doing?

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,350
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,660
N-No way...

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,470
We never give up.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,260
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,600
To save Kite...

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,990
Promise x And x Reunion

17
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,530
As the Queen prepares for the King's birth,

18
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,740
she requires the equivalent of two hundred
and fifty human meatballs per day

19
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,540
to give birth to a strong King.

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,030
It moved.

21
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,520
Meanwhile, Gon and Killua

22
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,320
continue their training so they
can defeat Knuckle and Shoot,

23
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,280
take their tokens, and return to NGL.

24
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,830
Will this really be enough for
them to execute the plan

25
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,140
to slaughter Morel's disciples?

26
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay, all done!

27
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,100
You finally lasted for three hours.

28
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,030
We did it...

29
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,640
That was hard!

30
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,230
I can't move an inch...

31
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,930
What are you talking about?

32
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,350
Stand up.

33
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,740
We're going out.

34
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,610
Huh?

35
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,790
Where to?

36
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,740
To see Knuckle.

37
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,740
Wh-Why?

38
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,900
See? You can move.

39
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,810
Let's go!

40
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,630
Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.

41
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,590
Jeez, don't ask questions
with obvious answers.

42
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,380
To fight him!

43
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,630
Huh?!

44
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,630
Okay, let's go!

45
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,730
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,450
We still have time.

47
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,250
What if we lose?

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,230
You just try again.

49
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,890
Huh?

50
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,940
Whether you win or lose isn't important.

51
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,130
All that matters is who ends
up with the tokens, right?

52
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
Which means you must take theirs.

54
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,250
If it looks like you'll lose, run.

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,780
Then try again the next day.

56
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,910
From here on, you'll practice
Ren for three hours a day.

57
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,040
After that, you'll challenge Knuckle.

58
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,040
And you'll continue until you win.

59
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,890
Still a no show, huh?

60
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,320
Your owner's really bad...

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,450
Hey, stop it!

62
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,640
That tickles.

63
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,770
Cut it out!

64
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,070
Hey, come on...

65
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,830
Is that Knuckle?

66
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,480
Yeah.

67
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,010
No way...

68
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,290
They're the other candidates?

69
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,160
Guess they must not respect me...

70
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,390
If I'm being compared to a couple of kids,

71
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,150
they must not think I'm very strong...

72
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,340
Eh?!

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,430
Such an intimidating presence...

74
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,410
We should act first, but we can't move!

75
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,460
A duel is a battle to the death.

76
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,780
Serious business!

77
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,930
It's best to fight five hours
after a good night's sleep.

78
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,540
So what's with you kids?
You're completely worn out!

79
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,300
Were you just out swimming or something, eh?

80
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,550
Take this seriously!

81
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,810
You kids can never defeat me.

82
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,440
Are you crying?

83
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,980
S-Stupid...

84
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,190
Wh-Why would I cry?

85
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm not upset about this.

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,140
Th-Th-These are just, well, uh...

87
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,110
Tears from laughing too much, fool.

88
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,050
I'll kill you, get it?

89
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,450
So don't tell anyone!

90
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,960
Punch me!

91
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,960
Huh?

92
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,190
I'll show you how much stronger I really am.

93
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,970
And you'll realize that I don't need
to bother dodging your punches.

94
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,200
Hit me as many times as you like.

95
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,460
But if I don't take a step from this spot,

96
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,980
leave your tokens behind.

97
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,430
This is the best chance you'll have!

98
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,490
You kids would need a hundred years
before you could try fighting me!

99
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,430
You're the one who challenged us to a duel.

100
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't look down on us!

101
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,500
I'd like to respond that way...

102
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,760
But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.

103
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,700
We have no right to argue that.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,630
Not right now...

105
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,760
The fact is,

106
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,520
we can't overcome everything with willpower.

107
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,730
We can't argue with him...

108
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,160
But we don't have to accept it!

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,370
I won't stop hitting you until you move.

110
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,890
Enough talk...

111
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,380
Just get to it.

112
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,410
First comes rock!

113
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

114
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,890
What's with the intense aura?

115
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,090
That's cheating!

116
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,180
I'll use Gyo...

117
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,500
No, I have to defend with Ko.

118
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,690
Crap...

119
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,880
But where do I defend?

120
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,650
If I guess wrong,

121
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,240
I could die...

122
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,160
Come on...

123
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,050
I'd expect him to attack the belly.

124
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,220
Yeah, that's the only real choice.

125
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,920
Gotta be the belly.

126
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,920
Rock...

127
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,300
Yeah, it's the belly!

128
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,920
Belly! Belly! Belly!

129
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,170
Paper...

130
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,390
Rock!

131
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,550
Knuckle-san?

132
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,770
You okay?

133
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:00,850
I... trusted... you...

134
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,610
What's with him?

135
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,450
Obviously, he's a total idiot.

136
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,710
Oh, are you awake?

137
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,530
You're stronger than I thought.

138
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,970
Guess I underestimated you...

139
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,230
Why didn't you take this?

140
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,480
You should've taken the
token and ditched me.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,790
We don't want your token.

142
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,040
We want the strength to defeat
you in a straight-up fight.

143
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,000
Could I ask you something?

144
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,060
Sure, go ahead.

145
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,630
Why did you become a Beast Hunter?

146
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,680
Huh?

147
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,010
It's a long story...

148
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,260
And it brings back bad memories.

149
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,750
Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?

150
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,010
Simply put, to keep it from doing its job.

151
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,610
I don't like the idea of cutting off
whatever doesn't fit the mold.

152
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,030
My teacher says I'm just a softy.

153
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,270
But you can't judge something that
you've never seen before...

154
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,450
First, you have to exchange blows.

155
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,670
And you'll get yourself killed in the process!

156
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,160
You're a good kid.

157
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,670
Now that we've fought, I see that.

158
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,770
You, too.

159
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,600
Huh?

160
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,300
You!

161
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,760
He wouldn't leave your side.

162
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,940
They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.

163
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,370
S-Stupid!

164
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm not crying...

165
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Don't tell anyone!

166
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,210
Or I'll kill you...

167
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,610
Morel's student...

168
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,610
It's good!

169
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,120
Fight me any time you want.

170
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,410
Huh?

171
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,500
I'll give you as many tries as you want.

172
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,140
But it's impossible for you to beat me

173
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,950
in the twenty days left.

174
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,010
Good stuff.

175
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,620
What is this smoke?

176
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,600
Where am I?

177
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,960
All right...

178
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,620
Let's begin, then.

179
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,890
What?

180
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,410
Chiona's squadron is missing?

181
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,330
Yes...

182
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,350
Is it similar to what happened
to Reikei's squadron?

183
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,400
It appears so.

184
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,840
The leader disappeared first,

185
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,240
and then the rest vanished, one by one.

186
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
Are the humans fighting back?

187
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,160
Well, that is the logical conclusion.

188
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,360
We've been cutting down on
the number of soldiers,

189
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,590
and our prey has begun to scatter.

190
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,250
If humans target us during an extended hunt,

191
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,440
it could be trouble.

192
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,280
Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?

193
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,140
No, we can't trouble the Queen right now.

194
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,230
Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?

195
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,150
That idea doesn't thrill me...

196
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,590
I'll let you handle things outside...

197
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,460
We'll protect the inside of the castle.

198
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,350
I'll try to strengthen this.

199
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,170
Just as I expected...

200
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,710
Well, at least she doesn't issue
any strange orders on a whim.

201
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,180
We should start by determining
our current troop strength.

202
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,090
How many Squadron Leaders remain?

203
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,880
Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight.

204
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,260
Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...

205
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,700
And each officer commands
ten to fifteen soldiers.

206
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,490
Some squadrons are under tight control,

207
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,960
but many are free to wander around.

208
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,270
The missing four squadrons fall
under the latter category...

209
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,610
Of the remaining squadrons,
over half lack discipline.

210
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,970
And none will heed a warning.

211
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,350
They've become arrogant since learning Nen.

212
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,290
Then we could use them to lay a trap.

213
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm sure that's what's currently going
through the enemy's mind...

214
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,610
Well, we should be able to
continue the current plan.

215
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,370
Yes.

216
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,560
Knov and I will be able to tell
once a trap has been laid.

217
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,020
In fact, I believe we should
spring a few of those traps.

218
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,630
Hmm?

219
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,340
If we ignore the disciplined squads,

220
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,390
they'll band together and cause us problems.

221
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,030
Most likely, they'll start pairing

222
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,030
disciplined and undisciplined squads together.

223
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,780
If we launch an indiscriminate
attack, it will result in chaos.

224
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,070
We should be able to eliminate
another three or four squads

225
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,530
before the enemy tries another approach.

226
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,990
I can already see their next move.

227
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,120
If all goes well, we'll finish up
before reinforcements arrive.

228
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,940
I hope

229
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,430
things go that way.

230
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,150
Okay, three hours! All done!

231
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,810
Well, then... Get going.

232
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,450
Here.

233
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,670
What, there are more of you?

234
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,200
Don't hold back...

235
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,830
Help yourselves.

236
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,210
They're here.

237
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,910
It's on, Knuckle!

238
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,490
Yeah, let's go!

239
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,290
I'll take you both on at once!

240
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I won't say a word about

241
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,790
how you're condescending to us...

242
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,290
We're more than happy to accept!

243
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,850
Let's go, Killua!

244
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,470
Yeah!

245
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,380
Come on...

246
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,750
I have no time to waste playing
around with you kids.

247
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
You have nothing but time.

248
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,760
Get serious!

249
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,010
That's more like it!

250
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,770
Their bodies are completely fatigued.

251
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,770
All that's moving them is sheer willpower.

252
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,280
Once they've accomplished
the tough task before them,

253
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,770
they'll gain a confidence boost
that will spur their growth.

254
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,990
However, to complete that task,
they must defeat me!

255
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,580
And that ain't gonna happen

256
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,590
on my watch!

257
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,520
Come on!

258
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,240
That all you've got?

259
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,830
Given his personality,

260
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,230
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...

261
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,360
I doubt he'd sell me out,

262
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,900
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.

263
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
My chance will come after they leave.

264
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,250
I will defeat them...

265
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,460
Next time:

266
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,270
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.

267
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,800
Hey, Killua.

268
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,740
Stop it, my turn...

269
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,790
That's our weakness!
