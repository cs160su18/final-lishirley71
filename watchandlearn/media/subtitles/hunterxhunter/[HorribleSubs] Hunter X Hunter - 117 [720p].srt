2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,290
Why?!

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,440
You have it easy, Killua.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,770
You're perfectly calm.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,020
Since it means nothing to you...

6
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,760
Gon's cry had guided
Meleoron to the two boys.

7
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,030
Insult x And x Payback

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,830
I'm going to have to refuse.

9
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,460
Right now, I'm not in the mood.

10
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,830
Come on, don't say that.

11
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,460
Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!

12
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,840
Let me test my new technique on you.

13
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,910
That hurts, man...

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,220
You don't have to give me such a dirty look.

15
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,980
The one I really want to fight
is someone else, you know.

16
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,910
That guy with sunglasses,
carrying the big pipe.

17
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,360
Aren't you with him?

18
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,710
Then, why don't you go and find him?

19
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,310
I know where he is.

20
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,780
But I can't get to him.

21
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,250
He controls smoke, and he's hidden
himself behind a smokescreen.

22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,750
And I can't get through.

23
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,010
I climbed up to the roof, to see
if I could get in from above...

24
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,740
And I happened to spot you.

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,770
So I'm supposed to be the warm-up
before your main fight?

26
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,270
Bingo!

27
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,910
I've had it for today...

28
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,790
Will you listen to what I have to say?

29
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,950
For the first time since taking
over the family business,

30
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,720
I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.

31
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,630
Dude, my technique is awesome!

32
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't be too shocked when you see it.

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,550
Well, you'll still be shocked in the end...

34
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,040
You're a self-centered fellow.

35
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,690
Doesn't look like I'll be able to
persuade you to let me go.

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,190
Bingo and bingo!

37
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,960
You should watch your back.

38
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,000
What an old trick!

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,940
I won't fall for that!

40
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,960
Your buddy told me to keep
my eyes on my oppone—

41
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,470
Well, the result would have
been the same either way.

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,030
Should I have spared him?

43
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,880
Not necessary.

44
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,750
How's Killua doing?

45
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,020
Hmm? He's matured.

46
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,710
And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.

47
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,050
I see.

48
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,140
Oh, that's right...

49
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,920
I had a rare experience today.

50
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,030
My time was compressed!

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,870
I must remember to ignore
half of everything you say.

52
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,390
Okay, we should be safe here.

53
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,740
Explain what's going on.

54
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,240
God's Accomplice... Undo!

55
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,500
Shoot's out of the battle,
and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone.

56
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,380
I need your help...

57
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,120
Knuckle's going to keep running,
to try and buy time.

58
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,630
He's crazy!

59
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,390
Okay, what's the minimum length of time
you can maintain God's Accomplice?

60
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,120
The first time, I was so nervous, I failed
and had to tap out after ten seconds.

61
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,010
But I've regained my cool.

62
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,990
If I don't move, I can hold my
breath for at least a minute!

63
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,980
That's plenty of time.

64
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,070
I just need one chance.

65
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,070
Approximately three minutes
before Killua raised his finger...

66
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,320
Knuckle was airborne.

67
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,550
In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest
point was his ability to run away.

68
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,680
Once, to help his friends escape,

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,590
he knocked out a cop,

70
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,170
and eluded four patrol cars and dozens
of police for a full day and night, on foot.

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,050
The day he finally escaped was the day

72
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,250
he graduated from grade school.

73
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,710
His stamina when maintaining top speed

74
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,510
far exceeds that of a cheetah.

75
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,760
To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen

76
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,580
to reveal himself and use an out-boxing
strategy against Youpi.

77
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,220
For the most part, it was the right choice.

78
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,650
He stopped chasing me?

79
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,280
If there was one thing he miscalculated,
it was his opponent's intentions.

80
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,030
Shoot's in trouble! Crap!

81
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,340
Shoot and Knuckle considered
Youpi a high-priority target.

82
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,300
But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.

83
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,570
As a Royal Guard, protecting the
King was his mission.

84
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,810
His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.

85
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,930
Youpi still believed the King
to be in the throne room.

86
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,520
And since guarding the stairway
was his assignment,

87
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,100
he was convinced that Pitou and
Pouf were protecting the King.

88
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:41,240
So his main priority was to keep enemies
away from the throne room.

89
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,020
Since he didn't know how
many enemies there were,

90
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,110
the nature of his opponent's
ability took second priority.

91
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,630
As did any enemies running or dying.

92
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,680
They did not warrant his concern.

93
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,680
Hey! Pitou!

94
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,300
Shoot!

95
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,200
Shoot was still alive.

96
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
Shoot...

97
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,460
Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,

98
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,190
he must have spotted Shoot.

99
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,580
Then we aren't even worth...

100
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,660
finishing off?

101
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,790
Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.

102
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,490
After having fought him with all they had,

103
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,990
the pair had never felt so humiliated.

104
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,390
Are Shoot

105
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,110
and I

106
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,460
no more than flies?!

107
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,760
Fine, then!

108
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,490
You're gonna regret this!

109
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,510
In a few more minutes,
this fly will send you flying!

110
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,020
Pitou! Pouf!

111
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Are you there?

112
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,050
The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.

113
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,280
That means he and Pouf are alone inside.

114
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,410
The King isn't in the throne room!

115
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,290
Say something! Can't you hear me?

116
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,290
Hey!

117
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,150
You fool...

118
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,720
You're free to defend an empty throne room!

119
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,380
I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance.

120
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,950
Damn it...

121
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,330
By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,

122
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,560
he had already made another.

123
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,280
Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.

124
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,530
Shoot must have been prepared
to die at that moment.

125
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,910
That's the kind of fight we came for.

126
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,530
But he ignored Shoot...

127
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,350
When Knuckle pictured the
expression on Youpi's face

128
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,290
after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot
and headed up to the third floor,

129
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,280
Knuckle realized his new mistake.

130
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,780
Damn it.

131
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,130
Damn it...

132
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,990
Am I supposed to ignore the fact
that my buddy's been humiliated?

133
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,970
For what reason?

134
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,630
For the world?

135
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,830
For humanity?

136
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,380
And if our mission succeeds,
I just shake Shoot's hand and say,

137
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,540
"We did it"?

138
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,650
Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?

139
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,140
Even though he was humiliated?

140
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,850
I can't do that!

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,710
That isn't right...

142
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,410
C-Come on...

143
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,670
Oh, sorry.

144
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,170
And while I'm apologizing, I need
you to wait here a little longer!

145
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,140
I need to punch that guy in the face...

146
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,530
And I'll throw another punch for you!

147
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,380
It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...

148
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,480
"Have you lost your mind?

149
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,190
Don't go.

150
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,920
Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time."

151
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,310
That is my...

152
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Do it, Knuckle!

153
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,710
Damn it!

154
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,270
That bastard...

155
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,960
He...

156
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,970
He...

157
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,290
looked at me like I was trash!

158
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,280
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...

159
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,740
Yeah, I got it!

160
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,310
Sorry, master...

161
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,240
We're both fools.

162
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,670
There's something more important
than the world right now!

163
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,580
Knuckle's new mistake

164
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,070
was a misjudgment of his priorities.

165
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,160
My attacks aren't having any
effect on this smoke...

166
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,980
Your Majesty!

167
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,250
Pitou! Pouf!

168
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,280
Are you there? Hey!

169
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,380
Is that Youpi?

170
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,760
Were they both defeated?

171
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,650
I hope the old man's doing okay...

172
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,260
Why isn't Pouf responding?

173
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,920
Something's wrong.

174
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,690
Why is he staying inside his cocoon?

175
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,350
I would have expected him to be in
more of a hurry to get to the King.

176
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Could we have made...

177
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,420
some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?

178
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,250
Is our operation actually working?

179
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,830
Don't think about it!

180
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,960
I'm here to fulfill my mission!

181
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,730
Doubt, worry, impatience...

182
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,030
Negative emotions are growing,
but his resolve has not faltered.

183
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,650
Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.

184
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,750
I'm impressed.

185
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,360
However, that will be the constraint
that weakens your decision-making.

186
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
Damn...

187
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,240
Why is Pitou's En gone?

188
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?

189
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,280
Leaving me behind?

190
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,630
What happened?

191
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,000
What's going on?

192
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,450
It's time.

193
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,390
Adding interest.

194
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,380
Shut up!

195
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,390
The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.

196
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,640
And the number on this thing keeps increasing.

197
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,090
I have to find the King!

198
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,150
Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs.

199
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,010
That might have gotten rid of this fog.

200
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,160
But I have to find the King!

201
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,410
What's going on?!

202
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,410
I'm getting annoyed!

203
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,440
Yo.

204
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,440
What the hell is wrong with all of you?!

205
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,450
And with that shout, Youpi transformed.

206
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,840
It was drastic enough to make Knuckle,
who thought he had come prepared,

207
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,960
instantly switch from an offensive
stance to an evasive one.

208
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,730
This manifestation of evil

209
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,800
clearly meant only to destroy.

210
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,670
Hang on!

211
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,650
Did you...

212
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,420
hit him?

213
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Eh?

214
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,840
Did you hit him...

215
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,550
for me?

216
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,610
Not yet, damn it!

217
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,280
I'll hit him hard, so hold on!

218
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,270
But we have to run, so we don't die first!

219
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,170
For the first time in his life,

220
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,130
Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.

221
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,640
This had made it apparent that

222
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,210
his power was not meant for guarding the King.

223
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,720
Rather, he realized that his violent rage

224
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,500
could fuel a rapid increase in the
mass of both his body and his aura.

225
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,700
The destruction brought him great pleasure,

226
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:41,040
after which his body rapidly shrank,
and he felt a strong sense of loss.

227
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,870
Knuckle's superior experience helped him
understand what had happened to Youpi.

228
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,370
We can win.

229
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,600
That was a powerful blast.

230
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,560
I doubt it'll be easy to goad him
into doing that on purpose,

231
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,980
and make it out unharmed.

232
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,040
But the return for taking that risk

233
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,110
will be enormous.

234
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,400
I make him mad, so he blows up.

235
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,210
The perfect time to hit him

236
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,270
would be when he's charging up.

237
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,910
And the aura required to fuel his explosion

238
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,550
will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.

239
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,230
The plan Knuckle formed on the spot

240
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,170
was almost flawless for dealing
with the berserk Youpi.

241
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,300
However, Youpi's true worth only
became clear after the explosion.

242
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,100
As Youpi transitioned between
lingering pleasure and despondency,

243
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,480
this selfish ability that could be
called the dregs of his ego

244
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,480
was focused solely on how he could use

245
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,180
this power for the King's sake.

246
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,440
Selflessness...

247
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,230
His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality

248
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,540
continued to function calmly even after
the discovery of his burst of emotion.

249
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,050
My contribution to the King will be

250
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:25,010
how well I can control this ability
without letting my emotions take over.

251
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,510
In other words,

252
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,260
I must use it to destroy the intruders.

253
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,510
Now that Youpi had learned how
to be both enraged and composed,

254
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,590
the risk for Knuckle was overly great.

255
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,300
Approximately three minutes have
passed since the mission began.

256
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,610
The intentions of all involved
are beginning to come together.

257
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,210
Next time: A x False x Rage.

258
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,060
Yeah, screw you!

259
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,320
Sorry, Killua...

260
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,780
I won't forgive you.

261
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,310
Here's a chocolate robot.

262
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,260
Gon!
