2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,960
Three days remain until the selection begins.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,080
In the palace, the King has
completed his recovery,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,860
and continues to play Gungi without rest.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,120
That's checkmate.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,380
Her mind and body are at their limit.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,900
I estimate it will only take another
match or two before the King wins.

8
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,010
Gungi x Of x Komugi

9
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,510
Time for a break.

10
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,220
We will resume in a half day.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,580
Wait, I can keep going!

12
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,170
If you can barely sit straight,
the victory won't satisfy me.

13
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,050
Recover your strength.

14
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,000
Even while his arm was being treated,
the King never stopped playing.

15
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,670
But now he changes his mind?

16
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,260
This female is dangerous.

17
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,260
If this continues,

18
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,700
she could prove quite troublesome...

19
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,780
Then, I will excuse myself.

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,420
I must not be too hasty.

21
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,450
The King chose to retract his decree.

22
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,230
In order to stay true to his convictions...

23
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,570
In order to defeat the Gungi
Champion at her best...

24
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,430
In order to demonstrate his strength!

25
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,700
If I kill this girl now,

26
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,660
the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever.

27
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,640
Her death will cement her status

28
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,370
as someone the King could never defeat!

29
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,350
I am such a fool!

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,320
My hasty impulse could have left
the King with a permanent scar!

31
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,380
I shall die of my own volition!

32
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,520
Once I have seen the King conquer the world...

33
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,340
Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex,
seven people will infiltrate the palace.

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,480
Shoot and me...

35
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,180
Gon, Killua,

36
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,220
Meleoron, Ikalgo,

37
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,340
and then Morel.

38
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,590
A few seconds after us,

39
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,170
the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's En.

40
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,300
During that time, we must draw
the Royal Guard from the King.

41
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,680
Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first.

42
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,170
When we suddenly appear
in the midst of the palace,

43
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,520
their immediate reaction will be...

44
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,290
To protect the King with their lives.

45
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,790
They'll probably use a formation like this.

46
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,940
Breaking it won't be easy.

47
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,950
And that's where I come in.

48
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,330
Okay, any questions?

49
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,850
Uh, about Palm...

50
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,440
Can we do anything to learn
what's happened to her?

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,650
She's either dead or in hiding.

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,200
If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us.

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation.

54
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,070
If she were captured,
she'd have taken her own life.

55
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,160
When she left, she was prepared for that.

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,290
If we try to check in on her,
it would be an insult to her resolve.

57
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,260
Hey, you're being too harsh!

58
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,880
Gon's just concerned about Palm.

59
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,380
And his concern is worthless.

60
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,300
What's that?!

61
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,180
You just came back! Where do you get off?!

62
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,840
Assuming that Palm was captured alive,

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,190
it would mean the enemy knows our plan.

64
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,410
Which would make us like moths
flying straight into the flame.

65
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,200
We'll be destroyed instantly.

66
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,290
But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,

67
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,560
what's important is that we trust Palm.

68
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,330
Well, that certainly makes sense,

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,380
but Gon's point might be that,

70
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,840
if Palm has met such a fate, we still
have time to change the plan.

71
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,840
Think again.

72
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,790
He'll say that we have to save Palm first.

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,970
But he won't offer any plans for that.

74
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,930
Right?

75
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,510
R-Right...

76
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,210
I see your point...

77
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,160
I know you're worried,

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,230
but once the operation starts,
you'll have to forget her until we're done.

79
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,650
If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,

80
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,240
that might cause our operation to fail.

81
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,500
We still have two days...

82
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,670
There's still time for Palm to contact us.

83
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,260
Nyow I understand.

84
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,880
Should I have tried to escape to the right?

85
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,020
You should have moved your knight.

86
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,680
I didn't want to let a single piece
control the center of the board.

87
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,320
Sometimes, you must accept
the risk and move forward.

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
Otherwise, you won't ever be
able to make me hesitate.

89
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,210
I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.

90
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,210
Your Majesty...

91
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,240
What is it?

92
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,220
I have some sensitive information,
so we should step outside.

93
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,970
It's fine, speak.

94
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,290
Two days remain until the National Celebration.

95
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,740
The number of citizens to process in Peijing
has increased beyond our expectations.

96
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,950
But the weather forecast is favorable,
so the selection should proceed as planned.

97
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,990
Get to the point.

98
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,530
I would like to move up

99
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,400
the post-selection schedule.

100
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,380
That's it? Do as you wish.

101
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,750
Yes, sir.

102
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,870
In that case, we will depart
immediately after the selection—

103
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,390
Don't make me repeat myself!

104
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,970
I'm telling you to decide on your own.

105
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,810
Do not return until I summon you.

106
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,390
So you were chased out, too?

107
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,140
Well, we only need to wait for the King to win.

108
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,340
You think that will only be a
few more matches, right?

109
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,350
No.

110
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,190
Wasn't that what you said a while ago?

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,070
The King is improving at a remarkable rate.

112
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,690
However, she is also evolving.

113
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,910
I am no longer able to predict the outcome.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Well, it's still only a matter of
time before the King wins.

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
I hope you're right.

116
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,190
I am. There's nothing to worry about.

117
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,060
I am one hundred percent confident
that he's acting on his own...

118
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,320
The man who defeated Leol.

119
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,180
The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,240
The soldiers under his control
are all smoke puppets.

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,450
Since their complex movements
are not typical of Nen puppets,

122
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,970
they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.

123
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,450
He can't control as many puppets as I can,
but his are more responsive.

124
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,210
I want to fight him...

125
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,720
But I can't leave my post.

126
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,550
Maybe he'll come to me...

127
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,130
It's about time for us to enter Peijing.

128
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,830
The enemy should have noticed
Morel's distraction by now.

129
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,250
We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate

130
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,030
their belief that this is all the work of one man.

131
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,000
At the same time,

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,480
many citizens will be moving toward the palace.

133
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,540
If we disappear the day before the celebration,

134
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,630
they'll believe assassins are hidden
among the citizens, trying to kill the King.

135
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,050
And their focus will be outside
the palace, on the crowds.

136
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,810
That's when we enter the palace with
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!

137
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,600
The King will definitely be here.

138
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,780
Watching the selection from
the third-floor throne room.

139
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,240
Will he really be there?

140
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,990
Something...

141
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,780
feels off.

142
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,260
2-1-3, pawn.

143
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,010
4-5-1, knight.

144
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,770
8-7-2, lieutenant general.

145
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,770
4-3-3, archer.

146
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,540
She continues to attack where
I'm weak without hesitation.

147
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,150
As we play, she's getting sharper.

148
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,850
2-1-1, knight.

149
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,600
6-6-1, major general.

150
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,370
But it does not pain me.

151
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,880
Rather, I find this enjoyable.

152
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,500
Because the board dictates my every move.

153
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,050
Which proves that she is still
several levels above me.

154
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,560
How strong can she become?

155
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,190
Supreme Leader...

156
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,190
I feel...

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,190
strange.

158
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,540
I can't stop.

159
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,850
Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...

160
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,100
I can become even better!

161
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,590
Has she awakened?

162
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,590
Then she's only

163
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,250
begun to grow.

164
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,530
That's checkmate.

165
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,110
Could I take a short break?

166
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,430
It's the first time she's asked for a break...

167
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,800
Is something wrong?

168
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,130
No, I'd like to return to my room to
record the moves that are in my mind.

169
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,320
But you can't see...

170
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,380
Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!

171
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,820
When I touch the pieces after they're placed,

172
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,010
I will never forget their position.

173
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,890
She's memorized every placement
she's ever experienced?

174
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,680
Very well, you're excused.

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,570
Thank you.

176
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,530
A foolish question...

177
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,650
Her name...

178
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,950
Hey.

179
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,650
What is your name?

180
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,470
You mean mine?

181
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,410
Is there anyone else around?

182
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,790
It's K-K-Komugi.

183
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,770
Komugi?

184
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,920
Supreme Leader...

185
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,170
Can you please tell me

186
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,300
what your name is?

187
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,300
My name?

188
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,550
What...

189
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,850
am I called?

190
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,940
Pitou.

191
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,820
Yes, what do you need?

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,570
Pouf.

193
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,340
Yes.

194
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,210
Youpi.

195
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,690
Yes.

196
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,030
Is something the matter?

197
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,590
Pouf...

198
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,330
Yes?

199
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,830
Right, you're Pouf.

200
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,750
Then...

201
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,260
What is my name?

202
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,260
I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty...

203
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,730
You are the King. You have no other name.

204
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,250
You are the one and only King.

205
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,100
At the moment, there are impostors
using that name without permission,

206
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,520
but we will eliminate them all.

207
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,280
So that the entire world will
know there is only one King.

208
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,790
That assumes the others can be eliminated.

209
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,790
"King" is a title.

210
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,800
A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name.

211
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,250
What of you, Youpi?

212
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,840
Your question is far beyond my capacity.

213
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,630
I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.

214
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,910
Pitou.

215
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,100
I believe that your feelings
are what matter most.

216
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,100
You should select the name
that you find most pleasing.

217
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,230
Very well, then.

218
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,080
You can choose a name after the selection.

219
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,710
Right now, our priority is to finish all the
preparations before tomorrow morning.

220
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,750
Your Majesty, is something wrong?

221
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,140
If you have any concerns, we shall address them.

222
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,240
That is why we are here.

223
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,730
Komugi's entire body was glowing.

224
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,010
Komugi?

225
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,640
The girl with the closed eyes.

226
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,860
He's remembered that human's name.

227
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,150
She experienced an awakening.

228
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,000
Komugi will now become much stronger,
although only at Gungi.

229
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,290
Pitou...

230
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,230
Yes.

231
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,720
If Komugi were put through the selection

232
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,890
that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?

233
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,360
She would die.

234
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,410
The selection chooses humans

235
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,290
with the physical and mental
strength to serve as soldiers.

236
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,350
The survivors will be those who demonstrate
excellent combat capabilities.

237
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,680
Your Majesty, please...

238
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,570
After meeting Komugi,

239
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,730
I've learned that strength can
manifest in different ways.

240
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,440
For example, during our trip here...

241
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,820
Your Majesty, please stop.

242
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,840
...I killed a child.

243
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,950
Your Majesty, you must not say it...

244
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,410
Perhaps that child...

245
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,660
It isn't right... It's inappropriate!

246
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,120
...had the potential to surpass
me in a certain field.

247
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,620
An almighty King...

248
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,790
Yet I extinguished that potential.

249
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,920
...can never show regret!

250
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,560
I extinguished it for no real reason.

251
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,550
You must not say any more!

252
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,300
I am...

253
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,770
King!

254
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,450
I took a life for no reason at all...

255
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,400
What tremendous strength I must possess!

256
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,520
I appear with no warning, to rob
countless beings of their inferior strength!

257
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,290
To crush... To destroy.

258
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,710
That is my power.

259
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,070
Brute force is the strongest
power in this world!

260
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...

261
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,990
Why not?

262
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,670
I jumped to the wrong conclusion,

263
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,200
and I nearly insulted the King.

264
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,540
I was foolish enough to think that the King
might have regretted his actions...

265
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,840
You always think too much.

266
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,330
Yes, that is correct.

267
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,890
Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived.

268
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,140
Yes, that is true.

269
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,770
If the girl will impede the King,
we should kill her.

270
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,650
To think my mind operates
on the same level as yours...

271
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,400
Yes...

272
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,410
My power is the strongest that exists.

273
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,790
All other power means nothing
in the face of my own.

274
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,380
They are as dust in the wind.

275
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,590
Komugi... That female is no different.

276
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,210
Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game.

277
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,180
I could turn her into no more than
a source of meat with the barest touch.

278
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,800
So her life depends on my mood.

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,810
If I change my mind,

280
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,510
I can immediately kill her!

281
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,820
Then why am I so hesitant?

282
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,320
The goal was to kill time while
waiting for the selection.

283
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,820
The selection is tomorrow...
Haven't I had enough?

284
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,850
I've had my fun. I no longer need her.

285
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,200
Do I kill her now?!

286
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,680
Th-Thank you very much...

287
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,850
Why did you not call for help?

288
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,120
Here...

289
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,560
And here...

290
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,940
You're covered in blood!

291
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,690
Damn, I don't believe it.

292
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
She's such a fragile creature!

293
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,920
Because it's still early...

294
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,450
I don't want to bother anyone else.

295
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,450
You aren't bothering anyone.

296
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,460
What am...

297
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,840
You are an important guest!

298
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,460
...I saying?

299
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,760
Didn't I come here to kill her?

300
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,880
Why do you cry?!

301
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,070
Why can't I do it?

302
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,080
I'm sorry!

303
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
But... But...

304
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,230
No one's ever been this nice to me!

305
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,460
What is this creature?

306
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,240
What do I want

307
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,730
to do with her?

308
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,430
Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.

309
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,790
Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas
keep flooding into my mind—

310
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,300
Then we're covered for future preview segments!
