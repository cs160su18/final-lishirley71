00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,840
The revived King, now calling himself Meruem,

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,730
carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,620
in order to recover his memories.

5
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,660
Pouf's main body is with the King!

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,380
They're heading toward the palace
at an alarming speed.

7
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,270
That probably means the chairman lost.

8
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,400
What can the rest of us can do?

9
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,980
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,900
What's happening?

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,530
Where is the Supreme Leader?

12
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,530
It won't stop following us.

13
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,340
That's annoying.

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,260
It's the enemy's power.

15
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,390
I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged

16
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,120
the enemy's physical body.

17
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,490
Ah, how interesting.

18
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,580
I shall test it.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,650
Incredible, that's my...

20
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,280
I understand.

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,240
My power was not meant for me.

22
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,980
It was meant to be used by the King!

23
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,710
Youpi.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,820
This does not make sense.

25
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,580
If you knew this power resulted
from an enemy's attack,

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,290
that means either you saw it used,

27
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,010
or it was used on you.

28
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,270
Which was it?

29
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,140
I was hit by an attack.

30
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,490
I cannot see it following you now.

31
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,120
So why does the enemy still live?

32
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,190
How did you free yourself
from the enemy's power?

33
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,600
Answer me.

34
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,780
We made an agreement.

35
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,050
In exchange for releasing me from his power,

36
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,050
I agreed to spare his comrade.

37
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,670
Then, after he released you,

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,530
you had the opportunity to finish
him off along with his comrade.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
Why did you not do so?

40
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,550
Honestly, I'm not sure.

41
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,450
I believe I felt that, if I had,
I would have lost in some way.

42
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,740
I felt that breaking a promise,

43
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,480
even a promise to an enemy,

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,710
would be equivalent to conceding defeat.

45
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,180
Impossible!

46
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,960
You're saying that your personal emotions

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,400
were the reason you spared the lives
of those who oppose the King?

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,470
I'm prepared to accept any punishment...

49
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,290
I have no excuses to offer.

50
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,610
I only ordered that you not lie to me.

51
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,110
I have no reason to punish
those who speak the truth.

52
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,360
Pouf.

53
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,870
Yes!

54
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,120
Youpi.

55
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,250
Yes!

56
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,840
We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.

57
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,280
Our bodies and souls have been linked...

58
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,140
It is no longer possible for the three of
us to hide anything from one another!

59
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,020
Your Majesty!

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,270
Your Majesty...

61
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,370
Let us go.

62
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,550
Yes!

63
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,370
Your Majesty...

64
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,550
Was that meant as a final warning

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,660
because you realize what I plan to do,
and the guilt it makes me feel?

66
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,880
Nevertheless!

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,790
Even if it means I am executed for my crime...

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,510
I do this for the King!

69
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,890
Where is she? Find her!

70
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,980
Hurry up and find her!

71
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,680
For the sake of our species!

72
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,100
Where is she?

73
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
Find her!

74
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,400
She is not necessary!

75
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
Find her, quickly!

76
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,170
I do this for the King.

77
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,940
Is she over there?

78
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,390
Wait! Not there!

79
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,910
No! That way!

80
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,410
Hey!

81
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,920
When you're split up, you can't hurt me.

82
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
You're ignoring me?

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
Wait up!

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,120
You can't remove APR without defeating me!

85
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,930
Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me.

86
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,400
Does the enemy who attached this

87
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,180
also have the ability to teleport?

88
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,960
That's someone else...

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,310
There's one who can make himself
and those around him invisible.

90
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,500
He looks like a chameleon.

91
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,780
I don't know his name, but he's
one of the Squadron Leaders.

92
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,940
Which means he's a traitor!

93
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,290
So you spared not only humans,
but a traitor, as well?

94
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

95
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,370
Your Majesty!

96
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,830
Until we've defeated them, please...

97
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,360
I do not care. It is irrelevant.

98
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,940
On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial

99
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,340
that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve.

100
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,660
Youpi...

101
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,880
We must accept your emotional instability,

102
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,130
as well as the traitor's betrayal,

103
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,770
as we move forward.

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,000
Humans are a sacrifice meant to help
us attain the next level of evolution.

105
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,740
The perfect sacrifice.

106
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,730
Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,

107
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,170
any lingering traces of the human ego will

108
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,790
be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait.

109
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,500
The King's opinion had completely
reversed following the explosion.

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,390
Was it due to the impact?

111
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,730
No.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,940
This was the King, as well.

113
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,920
If the enemy can become invisible,

114
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,460
I can find him by making contact.

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,360
I need to split myself

116
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,070
into the smallest clones
that can still retain sight,

117
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,280
and expand the search!

118
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,530
Bastard...

119
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,660
Clearly, I'm not his target.

120
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,670
He turned back just like that... Who is he after?

121
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,810
Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?

122
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,270
That's bad, then!

123
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,510
I can't think of any way to defeat the
King without Meleoron's ability...

124
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,690
I must protect Meleoron at any cost!

125
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,230
Pouf divided his clones to the point where
they're too small for me to see.

126
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,360
Unlike his main body, his clones have to be

127
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,070
at full size for me to see them.

128
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,210
The man with the pompadour
was obviously just a decoy.

129
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,340
They must know we've realized
that the chameleon is a traitor.

130
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,720
In other words, they believe that I've
returned to dispose of the traitor.

131
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,380
Assuming the chameleon is concealing
himself and the others as they flee,

132
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,920
and that the woman is among them,

133
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,110
if I get close, they will protect the
chameleon and abandon her!

134
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,240
Because they believe the
chameleon is my target.

135
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,130
They must have never imagined that I'd return

136
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,210
to kill the woman that Pitou was
trying so desperately to heal.

137
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,760
If they believe I've returned to rescue
the woman, it's even better!

138
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,640
They may even offer to hand her
over to me with conditions.

139
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,690
He must be after Meleoron.

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,050
Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor.

141
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,410
Hold on.

142
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,840
Let's make sure.

143
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,570
The door leading underground?

144
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,610
So that's it...

145
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,770
They realized that I know they
can become invisible,

146
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,150
and decided to give me two options.

147
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,530
The chameleon either ran inside
or fled somewhere else.

148
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,780
Their plan is to split up my clones
further, to weaken me.

149
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,240
No! Over there! Over there!

150
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,660
Over there! Over there! Over there!

151
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,210
What?

152
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,410
They're giving me two options.

153
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,810
But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?

154
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,230
Then they want to know which is my target?

155
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,300
Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?

156
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,320
Or do I send the majority of them after
the chameleon, to fool them?

157
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,680
Even if the shutter is closed,

158
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,340
I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.

159
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,550
No, I don't have time for that!

160
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,620
I'll go after

161
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,970
the woman!

162
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,730
So she's his target?

163
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,860
I only have to kill the woman

164
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,730
and hide her body from the
King for a short time.

165
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,330
My clone can manage that!

166
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,240
I only need a minute or two!

167
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,430
He's...

168
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,720
incredibly fast!

169
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,740
Then she's your target?

170
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,190
I'm up for a game of tag.

171
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,330
I can go all night.

172
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,290
Judging by how quickly he reacted,

173
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,140
it would be hard to catch him,
even at full strength.

174
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,420
If I don't hurry, the King will arrive.

175
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,920
What do I do?

176
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,450
Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution.

177
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
I know!

178
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,410
The greatest magic of all...

179
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,400
He split himself up?

180
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,450
But he won't be big enough to take her away!

181
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,420
Is he going to attack me first?

182
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,050
Your plan is going to backfire...

183
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
You've reduced your speed and power,

184
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,180
so I don't even need to use Godspeed.

185
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,170
Cease this futile resistance.

186
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,820
Your plans have already been thwarted!

187
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,040
What is the point in adding
to your transgressions?

188
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,570
If it is fear of retribution driving
you to flee, you needn't worry.

189
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,080
The King will forgive you.

190
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,480
He is a benevolent ruler.

191
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,730
Don't make me laugh!

192
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,450
You think I'll believe that?

193
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,950
You'll probably tie me to a tree,
and turn me into a solider!

194
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,840
The King?

195
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,270
That's right...

196
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,610
Keep running.

197
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
Take her far from the King first!

198
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,310
That confirms it...

199
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,600
I don't know the reason,

200
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,050
but this girl is important to the King.

201
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,960
For Gon... For the sake of our mission...

202
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,020
I can't let the enemy have her!

203
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,360
That's right...

204
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
The person chasing us sounded like

205
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,870
one of the people with the Supreme Leader...

206
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,680
Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?

207
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,010
Then who is this person?

208
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,790
Who are the people he was with?

209
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,390
Your twisted sense of justice
will never help the people!

210
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,000
First, I cast a spell on the woman.

211
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,650
I use magic words to make her suspicious...

212
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,610
The King and I seek open dialogue.

213
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,900
Now, release her at once!

214
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,450
Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.

215
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,870
What is he up to?

216
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,340
Let me go...

217
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,640
Please put me down!

218
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,790
Something's wrong with you!

219
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,760
You're all tingly!

220
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,630
What are you talking about, fool?

221
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm trying to save you!

222
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,110
You're lying!

223
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm lying?

224
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,920
You trust that insect more than you trust me?

225
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,020
Insect?

226
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,560
What are you talking about?!

227
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,470
Let go! Let me go!

228
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,710
That's right... She can't see!

229
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,440
That'll make it hard to explain.

230
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Damn... Almost got him.

231
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,860
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.

232
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,770
If the woman you're carrying resists,
your speed will also fall...

233
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,890
What's going on?

234
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,460
He wasn't aiming for me...

235
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,800
He was aiming for the woman.

236
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,800
He was trying to kill her!

237
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,390
If she escapes, that's fine.

238
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,560
If she distracts him with her resistance,

239
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,570
allowing me to kill her, even better!

240
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,450
Komugi-san!

241
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,690
The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.

242
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,900
They will not kill you...

243
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,260
Keep struggling!

244
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,000
Keep fighting back!

245
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,670
I'll save you soon!

246
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,840
She was knocked out, so that's impossible.

247
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,780
Well, I have no idea what's going on here,

248
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,480
but I know that you're making me mad.

249
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,180
If you enter this ring,

250
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll kill you.

251
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,200
You may be a clone,

252
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,630
but you were formed from the original's cells.

253
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,380
If I burn those cells, they die.

254
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,270
Electricity...

255
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,390
Come on... I'll whittle you down.

256
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,390
Are you having difficulty?

257
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,150
I can feel your impatience.

258
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,270
I shall lend you a hand.

259
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,860
It's nothing you need to worry about.

260
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,470
Your first priority should be regaining
your memories, Meruem-sama.

261
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,360
Once my main body has returned,
I can deal with the intruders easily.

262
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,290
Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!

263
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,780
Humans, as far as we can see!

264
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,800
Do you remember now?

265
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,530
They are all here for you...

266
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,430
They all belong to you!

267
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,030
They belong to me?

268
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,990
You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,

269
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,790
and stand atop the food chain.

270
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,910
That is your glorious destiny!

271
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,700
As willed by the heavens!

272
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,990
Something isn't right...

273
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,840
There's still something else...

274
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,220
Something else I've forgotten.

275
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,280
What are you saying?

276
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,220
Nothing could be more important
than ruling over all life forms...

277
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,360
I suppose.

278
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,100
Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.

279
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,360
However...

280
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,720
The pain won't cease.

281
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,620
Why is the palace in shambles?

282
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,000
It was destroyed in the battle.

283
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,380
It happened after you left the palace.

284
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,380
Where is the place I spent most of my time in?

285
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,890
It has been completely destroyed...

286
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,900
I suppose I should look at what's left.

287
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:01,150
Yes, you may find something that will
help you regain your memories...

288
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
This is bad!

289
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,720
That could be it...

290
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,990
The Gungi board and pieces!

291
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,920
They may be the key to awakening his memory!

292
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,420
I must dispose of them!

293
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,770
He gave up?

294
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,980
Over there.

295
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,710
Let's go.

296
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,780
Next time: Magic x to x Destroy.

297
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,120
Killua, thanks.

298
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,340
What's this about?

299
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,030
We're buddies, right?

300
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,910
Yeah, but still...

301
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,620
Thanks.
