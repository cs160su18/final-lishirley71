2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,090
Wait...

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,690
By using...

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,570
words?

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,100
King...

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,410
Would you like to know your name?

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,620
How would you know my name?

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,800
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,010
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,340
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

11
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,380
Interested in fighting me now?

12
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,720
If you can force me to admit defeat,

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,240
I will tell you your name.

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,310
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,060
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,770
No matter.

17
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,040
I shall checkmate you shortly.

18
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,980
Centipede x And x Memory

19
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,020
As the King and Netero prepared
for their final battle...

20
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,030
Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing,

21
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,960
having failed to finish off
the unconscious Brovada.

22
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,030
Fire! This is the best option!

23
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,180
There's no one else to help me!

24
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,590
I h-have to...

25
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,840
kill him!

26
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
This is no time to be crying...

27
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
I have to find Palm!

28
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,810
Huh?

29
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,370
The door to the warehouse area is open.

30
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,570
So is the door leading to the garage!

31
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,150
Why?

32
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,530
Don't move!

33
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,830
If you move, I'll attack.

34
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,580
Welfin...

35
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,840
I have a lot of things to ask you.

36
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
If you seem to be trying anything funny,

37
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,430
I'll kill you!

38
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,440
What he wants to ask me

39
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,050
is obvious!

40
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,450
The number of my allies,

41
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,960
their roles,

42
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,100
and their abilities.

43
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,360
And he intends to use any means
necessary to get the answers.

44
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,490
People could die if I leak information.

45
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,350
If he's a Manipulator,

46
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,780
he can obtain the information against my will.

47
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,580
Huh?

48
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,250
D-Don't move!

49
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,500
I really will kill you!

50
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,420
Go ahead... Kill me.

51
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,250
That's what I want!

52
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,750
Stop!

53
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,760
If the alternative is betraying my buddies,

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,210
I'll take you with me!

55
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,570
Ouch!

56
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,890
Bastard! Now you've done it!

57
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,890
Damn it!

58
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,360
I'll kill you!

59
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
Missile Man!

60
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,530
I'm... not dead...

61
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,930
I didn't sustain any damage.

62
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,950
What was that attack?

63
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,200
Damn, that hurts...

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,420
You little punk...

65
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,960
Damn...

66
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,210
That bastard... How did a wimp like
that figure out my weakness?

67
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,620
Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.

68
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,860
If an enemy attacks before I can ask
a question, it's null and void!

69
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,110
The wound isn't deep...

70
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,530
I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.

71
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,850
Huh?

72
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,750
He planted something inside me?

73
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,830
Those were created by my Nen.

74
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,630
They're black centipedes.

75
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,630
Black Centipede

76
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,140
They grow by feeding on your resistance.

77
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,450
If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,

78
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,910
you'll suffer excruciating pain,

79
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,570
then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!

80
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,950
Wh-What are you doing, fool?

81
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,900
Weren't you listening to me?

82
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,240
If you try to do that...

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,790
That's fine with me.

84
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,100
If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!

85
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,570
S-Stop!

86
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,830
No, wait...

87
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,860
If he wanted to kill me, that's the
ultimate form of resistance.

88
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,850
Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!

89
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,260
Don't worry.

90
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,260
I'm not interested in killing you...

91
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,490
I just need to make sure that you can't leave.

92
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,480
I still...

93
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,110
have plenty of bullets.

94
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,870
Bastard! Don't mess with me!

95
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,620
I'll kill you!

96
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,020
You're dead! I'll kill you!

97
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,710
It's so easy.

98
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,660
When I'm prepared to offer my own life,

99
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,480
it's so easy to pull the trigger.

100
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,000
I g-get it...

101
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,080
I get it, already.

102
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,540
I won't go anywhere!

103
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,260
I surrender.

104
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,300
Please... Don't fire!

105
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,440
The pain is going away.

106
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,570
The creatures inside me are suffering?

107
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,810
I lose, damn it...

108
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,310
I can't move anymore.

109
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,910
Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?

110
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
Man, I knew it...

111
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,780
I had a feeling this would happen eventually.

112
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,350
But still...

113
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,740
I didn't think I was this weak!

114
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,480
I didn't think it'd be so scary
to face someone who fights

115
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,970
with no regard for their own life!

116
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,310
Hey.

117
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,620
What?

118
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,850
The pain has stopped, but can
you get rid of these bugs?

119
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,800
Stop complaining...

120
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm in too much pain to think about that now!

121
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,340
Hurry up.

122
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,870
Give me a minute!

123
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,990
I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.

124
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,050
But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble...

125
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,130
Damn, how do I get out of this?

126
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,480
I need to buy time...

127
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,300
Until I can come up with a good idea.

128
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,830
The pain is making me...

129
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,850
feel faint...

130
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,370
Wait! Okay!

131
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,470
I was lying! I won't do it again!

132
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,540
Then get rid of these.

133
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,900
Yeah, uh...

134
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,430
So, the thing is...

135
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,270
Forget it. I see how it is.

136
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,310
Wait! Hold on!

137
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,900
I can't remove them!

138
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,570
Not once they've been activated!

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,490
That's why I didn't want to say anything.

140
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,010
It's the truth! Believe me!

141
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,830
I'm not trying to trick you!

142
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,440
The insects are in pain again.

143
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,380
Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?

144
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,790
Can you really blame me?

145
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,030
I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.

146
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,840
I never cared what happened after that.

147
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,350
I never gave any thought to
what happened to my enemy.

148
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,680
Nen abilities are really something.

149
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,610
My abilities reflect my own personality.

150
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,760
My personality? His true intentions?

151
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,220
Welfin...

152
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,570
What do I ask him?

153
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,800
What do I want to know?

154
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,470
I once knew someone just like him.

155
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,090
Do you have any memories from
when you were human?

156
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,600
Wh-Why are you asking about that?

157
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,790
I can't remember...

158
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,150
You're lying.

159
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,470
Wh-What?

160
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,240
Stop! Hold on!

161
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,030
Calm down!

162
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,710
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you.

163
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,440
When I woke up,

164
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
my first thought was...

165
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,900
Damn...

166
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,600
I can still remember it.

167
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.

168
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,780
I was fed to the Queen,
and reborn as something new...

169
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,840
But I still...

170
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,970
I still remember the one thing
I most wanted to forget.

171
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,280
The sight of my father strangling me,

172
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,040
and the woman watching behind him.

173
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
At first, I only had flashbacks of it.

174
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,370
Over time, I remembered the
entire sequence of events.

175
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,130
I was saved by...

176
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,990
my little brother, who was unrelated by blood.

177
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,140
I remember now!

178
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,260
He looked just like Gyro!

179
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,530
Gyro?

180
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,520
You know. The king!

181
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,600
We used to brag about whose
life was more miserable.

182
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,810
He was the only one I could
turn to when I needed

183
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,540
to laugh away my tears...

184
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,810
We were both empty.

185
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,470
So we had nothing to hide.

186
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,730
I wonder what he's doing now...

187
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,570
I want to see him one more time...

188
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,560
Yes, I just want to see Gyro.

189
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,250
I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,

190
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,730
with money and nations...

191
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,200
Go.

192
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,540
The bugs are gone.

193
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,610
You still have something to do.

194
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,620
Why did you open the doors?

195
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,380
Oh, I was letting those weaklings
reach the treasure in the back.

196
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,600
They can't put up much of a fight.

197
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,310
I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.

198
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,890
And I told them to pass while
you were on the way back.

199
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,630
A coward!

200
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,280
It was that simple.

201
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,910
Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,

202
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,920
I thought you'd be an easy target.

203
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,890
I couldn't have been more wrong.

204
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,140
Go on.

205
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,260
I'm too tired to move...

206
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,420
I have one last question.

207
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,930
Did you see a woman in the palace?

208
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,420
A woman?

209
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,350
Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,

210
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,840
but the Royal Guard captured a human,
and put her in a cocoon.

211
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,950
Where is she?

212
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,410
Take the elevator up, then turn left.

213
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,450
It's the room at the end of the hall.

214
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,690
They called it #1.

215
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,120
Thank you!

216
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,960
What's so funny?

217
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,220
Telling the truth

218
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,930
feels really good...

219
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,990
Welfin had spent his life unable
to trust himself or others.

220
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,820
Telling Ikalgo the location of
the one he searched for

221
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,950
was the first time he'd opened
up and spoken honestly.

222
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,840
Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.

223
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,970
I'm just... I'm just...

224
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,670
What's wrong, Killua?

225
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,890
I'm here for you.
