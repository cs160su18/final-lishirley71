00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,600
Something,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,090
will you forgive me for being a

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,710
bad big brother?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,010
'Kay.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,340
I...

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,500
love Killua.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,910
Don't make the same mistake.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,950
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,970
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,100
but either way, you should apologize!

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,670
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,820
Do you know it?

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,650
Huh?

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,600
No, what is it?

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,760
You promise to do things differently next time.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,610
And you keep that promise, no matter what.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,280
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,990
Salvation x And x Future

20
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,140
She had red hair just like yours.

21
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,000
I shot her because

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,220
I knew that the scumbags pursuing her

23
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,300
enjoyed keeping their prey alive to toy with.

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,070
After my rebirth as an Ant,

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,490
I realized that I was doing the
same things I'd done before.

26
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,530
Before I was reborn this way,
my job was to get rid of people.

27
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,470
When ordered to, I pulled the trigger.

28
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,410
I spent the rest of my time yelling at people.

29
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,010
It was a job anyone could do.

30
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,580
A ridiculous cycle that continues even after rebirth.

31
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,910
I wanted to give her an escape from that cycle.

32
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
I didn't know exactly how it all worked,

33
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,600
but...

34
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I felt that if I let them capture her,
torture her, then kill her,

35
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,530
the cycle would repeat itself.

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,490
A dull life in the middle of nowhere,

37
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,870
but one lived in peace and quiet...

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,740
Until that life was suddenly ended
by mindless violence.

39
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,130
I pulled the trigger

40
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,540
with a prayer that she would escape that cycle.

41
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,280
Regardless of my actions,
the Queen ate hundreds of humans.

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,000
And when they were reborn, only a few
could remember their prior lives.

43
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,730
It's possible that most of the human
souls managed to safely escape.

44
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,160
But I wanted to do something.

45
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,250
I wanted to feel like I was helping them escape.

46
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,280
If you're inside that body instead of her,

47
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,190
that probably means she escaped,

48
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,790
and I still haven't run into an Ant

49
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,180
who's told me I killed them in their prior life.

50
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,050
Perhaps they were all able to escape.

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,430
Before all this happened, I didn't believe
in the human soul's existence.

52
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,690
I believed that humans had

53
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,740
the same worth as flies or fleas,
and that they only lived and then died.

54
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,790
That the ego was nothing more

55
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,950
than a bug that arose because the human
brain was slightly more complex.

56
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,090
That there was nothing after death.

57
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,470
Our bodies simply decomposed,
turned to dust, and scattered.

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,970
I believed those tiny fragments had no purpose.

59
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,300
But now, here I am.

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,570
And I'm repeating the cycle.

61
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,960
My appearance is completely different,

62
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,720
but I'm doing the same stupid things as before.

63
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,610
It made me think.

64
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,470
I may be a fool, but I won't deny
the things that I know now.

65
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,330
And I don't want to ignore the
things I don't understand.

66
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,960
I died.

67
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,310
I died, and my body was broken into tiny pieces.

68
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,540
But that wasn't the end.

69
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,460
The fragments that I believed were
too small to retain any meaning

70
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,760
possessed a power I could have never imagined.

71
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,980
Particles no larger than pollen from our perspective

72
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,830
have enough energy to impact our health

73
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,290
tens or hundreds of millions of years later.

74
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,900
And our DNA, which is even smaller,

75
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,920
contains the vast amount of information that
comprises us, all within a double helix.

76
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,410
And that infinitesimally small
size is a necessity for

77
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,350
the birth of the enormous space
known as the universe.

78
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,430
Just because something is small does
not mean it produces less energy.

79
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,220
The soul is probably small, but it has
enough energy to repeat the cycle.

80
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,680
Does that mean I was reborn to continue that cycle?

81
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,560
I don't know what the future holds.

82
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,310
So this is nothing more than
speculation on my part,

83
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,280
but something inside told me that I
mustn't repeat the same things again.

84
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,850
I'm guessing that I'm forced
to repeat all of this because

85
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,420
there was something I failed to provide
my soul with while I was alive.

86
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,090
You know how the body

87
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,130
moves more slowly without
the soul's encouragement...

88
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,830
In my case, I've always been driven by the thought

89
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,420
that I can't let things stay this way.

90
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,510
I know it isn't right.

91
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,000
I will repeat the cycle,

92
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,250
while thinking that I have to change things.

93
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,470
Because I made the wrong choice.

94
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
My target shouldn't have been that girl.

95
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,400
It should have been the ones pursuing her.

96
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,980
It's no big deal.

97
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,000
It just means I was the biggest scumbag of all.

98
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,400
The price for cleansing a tainted
soul was too heavy,

99
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,670
so I avoided that.

100
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,310
While selfishly praying that her soul would escape,

101
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
I was desperate to avoid getting hurt myself.

102
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,690
I shot her to protect myself.

103
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,530
And now, I'm trying to save myself again
by confessing my sins to you,

104
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,280
the one who inherited her appearance.

105
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,560
Really...

106
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,250
I'm a hopeless case.

107
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,780
I appreciate your listening to my story.

108
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,410
Wait. Don't run away.

109
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,670
You come with me.

110
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,760
Forever.

111
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,920
You'll stay with the person you shot,

112
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,080
living life the only way you can.

113
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,590
This is your duty.

114
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,930
You have no choice.

115
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,440
No one will allow you to take your own life

116
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,440
and hit the reset button.

117
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,440
You must live and apologize to me every day.

118
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,990
I'll keep you so busy, you'll never have time

119
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,480
to worry about what's right or wrong.

120
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,410
You will apologize to me

121
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,840
and do the work I tell you to do,

122
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,850
as you devote your life to me.

123
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,610
If you forget your current resolve and slip,

124
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,630
I will kill you.

125
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,220
So you can focus on living.

126
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,690
Kite, you have a visitor.

127
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,620
Let them in.

128
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,900
Kite?

129
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,800
Yeah.

130
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,770
Sorry.

131
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,020
Come. Sit.

132
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,290
Sorry for what?

133
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,800
I wasn't able to fight by your side.

134
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,310
I wasn't

135
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,300
strong enough.

136
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,320
But...

137
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,570
Next time, I'll protect you!

138
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,400
It sounds like you did some
crazy stuff to defeat Pitou.

139
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,800
Yeah, I almost died...

140
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,010
However, that doesn't change the fact
that you defeated an enemy I couldn't.

141
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,330
I suppose I can soothe my ego by telling myself

142
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,000
that my judgment was correct.

143
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,670
But I wouldn't be here now without
help from Killua and everyone else.

144
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
I didn't make it here by myself.

145
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,340
It appears that we both needed more training.

146
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,640
I heard that you met Ging-san.

147
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,000
Did you talk to Ging?

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Yeah.

149
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,810
You should go back to him.

150
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,630
I understand what you wanted to say.

151
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,140
I'm glad you came to see me.

152
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,900
If I need help, I promise to let you know.

153
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,480
Say hi to Killua for me.

154
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,070
We're friends now.

155
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,160
So right now, go back to Ging-san.

156
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay.

157
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,050
Sorry.

158
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,620
Sorry for what?

159
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,690
I was trying to take the easy way out
by running away from everything.

160
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,500
No matter the pain, I will keep living.

161
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,760
So when I die, I'll feel I did the best I could.

162
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,340
Ging!

163
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,230
I'm waiting atop the World Tree.

164
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,330
I tried to stop him...

165
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,190
Yeah, he didn't say that he
would wait for me here...

166
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,790
It's huge!

167
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,790
This is definitely the tallest tree in the world.

168
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,200
The World Tree stands at the city's center,

169
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,620
at a height of 1,784 meters.

170
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,310
Humans are still unable to build a taller structure.

171
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,070
Climbing the tree is not forbidden,

172
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,580
but you must pay a fee and sign a written agreement.

173
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,430
You can reach the 500-meter
point by elevator or stairs,

174
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,520
but after that, you'll be risking your life.

175
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,240
Every year, around 3,000
people attempt the climb,

176
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,030
but 94% fail to reach the 1,000-meter
point, and turn back.

177
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:19,740
Another 4% are forced to pay an extremely
pricey fee to be rescued from the tree,

178
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,600
and another 1% fall and die.

179
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,260
Which means that, each year,
only about 30 people make it

180
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,430
to the top and return safely.

181
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,870
So...

182
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
This is as far as we're going.

183
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,710
Yeah.

184
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,130
Be careful.

185
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,510
Yeah.

186
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,370
Killua, thank you for everything.

187
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,140
Yeah.

188
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,000
Well,

189
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,640
after you told me you would defeat Pitou alone

190
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,570
and that it was none of my business,

191
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,070
I was pretty depressed!

192
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,450
I'm really sorry...

193
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,080
Brother!

194
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,890
Well, you apologized.

195
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,840
And I think I can say I'm only here with Alluka
now because of the time I spent with you.

196
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,920
She's the one who healed you.

197
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,920
Huh?! Is that true?

198
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,840
Why are you telling me now?

199
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,940
You should have told me sooner!

200
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,010
Sorry.

201
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,270
We don't want too many people knowing about this.

202
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,340
You know, it's sort of a complicated family thing...

203
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,300
Come with me!

204
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,270
Alluka, can you tell Something to come out?

205
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,440
Yeah.

206
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,620
She has the power to grant any wish I make.

207
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,650
Any wish?

208
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,210
Because of that power,
she was locked up in our house.

209
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,220
But thanks to you, she's outside now.

210
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,500
And I'm prepared to spend the
rest of my life protecting her.

211
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,430
We should be the ones thanking you.

212
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,370
'Kay.

213
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,080
N-No way...

214
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,240
I should be thanking you!

215
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,000
This is no good. If we stay here any longer...

216
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah.

217
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,680
I'll be traveling to all kinds of places with Alluka.

218
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,740
I'll e-mail you from time to time.

219
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,280
Me, too.

220
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,470
If anything comes up, let me know.

221
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,930
I'll do the same.

222
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,170
Yeah, I will.

223
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,540
Since you owe me a lot...

224
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,450
Say hi to your dad for me.

225
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,540
Yep.

226
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,790
I want to go with you, but I have to watch Alluka.

227
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,940
And you haven't had a chance to talk alone yet.

228
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,470
See you around.

229
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,300
After I've had my brother all to
myself for a while, I'll set him free.

230
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,890
Will you hang out with him then?

231
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,920
Hold on!

232
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm the one choosing to hang out with him!

233
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,480
Isn't she a great sister?

234
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,310
Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned,
you're in second place.

235
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,460
Kite said that no matter where we go,

236
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,130
we'll always be friends!

237
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,330
Yeah!

238
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,730
Bye!

239
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,700
Later!

240
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,300
Next time: Past x And x Future.

241
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,670
I'll introduce you to Ging eventually!

242
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah, that's a promise.

243
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,130
So until we meet again!

244
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,110
Yeah!
