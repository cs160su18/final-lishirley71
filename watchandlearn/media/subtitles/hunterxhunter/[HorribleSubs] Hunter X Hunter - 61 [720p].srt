2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,040
A field of green.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,940
Stretching as far as I can see...

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,170
I'm being watched.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,680
Someone's out there...

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,050
Invitation x And x Friend

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,270
Anyway, I have to wait for Killua.

8
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,700
Yo, sorry to make you wait.

9
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,990
Do you feel something
constantly watching us?

10
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,140
Yeah, eyes this persistent
can only be a human's.

11
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,960
So everyone's noticed.

12
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,090
Well, they can't be too good
if we can sense them from here.

13
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,580
Just ignore it.

14
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,410
We're being watched.

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,060
Killua!

16
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,980
Sorry.

17
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't see any nearby towns.

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,470
Yeah, but everyone headed
in the same directions.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,530
They either went this way or that way?

20
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,420
Huh? How did you know?

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
Because that's where we're
being watched from.

22
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,220
But we still don't know
why they're watching us.

23
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,240
True.

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
Well, let's go.

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,250
Regardless of who's watching, we should
start by gathering information.

26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,850
So, how did it go?

27
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,790
Hmm?

28
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,350
Your save data.

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,130
Book.

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,130
How many cards were inside?

31
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,850
There weren't any cards inside.

32
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,260
Huh? For real?

33
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,110
But there was a message from Ging.

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,410
What did he say?

35
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,400
To enjoy the game.

36
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,000
Enjoy the game?

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,590
But this doesn't really feel like a game.

38
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,290
Book.

39
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,710
What do you think about the rules?

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,910
I still don't know enough yet.

41
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,330
What was that?

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,380
Was it Nen?

43
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,680
This must be your first
time playing this game.

44
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,180
I wonder if you're right.

45
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,640
Since you're carrying a book,
you must be a player.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,430
Well, sure.

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,800
You can't fool me.

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,500
I know you're new to this game.

49
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,940
Steal
Reveal all free slots of
one target player. (Can
only be used on a player
who's been encountered
within the game.)
[LR][NORM]

50
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,940
I can use the Steal card.

51
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,450
Casting Steal.
Select target player.

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,450
What is he doing?!

53
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,960
Zefespa
Grecoloas
Killua
Gon

54
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,220
Killua-kun and Gon-kun, huh?

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
How do you know our names?

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,090
How indeed?

57
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,970
You have zero chance if you don't
know about the spell cards.

58
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,790
View Killua's free slots?
Yes      No

59
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,050
No cards in Killua's free slots.
Steal card was consumed.

60
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,570
And that confirms it.

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,910
They're total newbies who just arrived.

62
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,480
And they're kids.

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,490
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,490
I don't wanna waste this spell on them.

65
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,120
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

66
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,120
Trace should be good enough.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,680
Trace on!

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,870
Attack, Killua!

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,630
You can't run from spells in this game!

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,130
Killua, are you okay?

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,630
My attack worked!

72
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,640
What did you just do to me?

73
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,110
This kid's dangerous!

74
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,650
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

75
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,650
Return on!

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,150
Take me to Masadora!

77
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,460
Shizuku, Kortopi...

78
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,210
Do you have a moment?

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,090
Play the game?

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Yes, would you like to join me?

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,220
Once we get home,
there's nothing for us to do.

82
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,420
You really want to clear this game?

83
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,510
Actually, clearing it isn't my goal.

84
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,730
Then this relates to Troupe business?

85
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,100
More or less.

86
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,430
Understood.

87
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,310
Sure.

88
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,600
Killua, how are you holding up?

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,910
Hmm? I don't feel any different.

90
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,680
But I'm still worried.

91
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,120
He definitely did something to you.

92
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,620
No point in worrying about it now.

93
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,840
Hey, was he using Nen
when he said, "Trace on"?

94
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,260
No, it's probably some magic
that only works in the game.

95
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,150
Magic? What kind?

96
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,300
Beats me.

97
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,430
Well, we'll find out eventually.

98
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,440
Yeah.

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,140
Look, there's a town!

100
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,140
Welcome to Antokiba, City of Prizes

101
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,400
Are those the prizes?

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,150
Wow, all these are prizes?

103
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,590
Looks that way.

104
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,830
Oh, Killua...

105
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,530
Look.

106
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,530
"Antokiba Monthly Tournaments Schedule."

107
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,780
There's a rock-paper-scissors
tournament this month.

108
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,040
September: Rock-Paper-Scissors
Prize: Sword of Truth

109
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,040
The prize is a Sword of Truth.

110
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,450
Is that an important item?

111
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,700
Probably.

112
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,420
Look over there.

113
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,580
And over there.

114
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,010
Should we participate?

115
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,300
Of course.

116
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,500
Then let's try to win all kinds of prizes.

117
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,930
We should also gather information.

118
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,450
Welcome!

119
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,620
If you can finish this within thirty
minutes, you don't need to pay!

120
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,570
In addition, you'll also receive
a Galgaida as your prize.

121
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,570
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.

122
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,820
Okay, begin!

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,750
Hey, chef.

124
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,770
Do you know how to use magic?

125
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,140
What's that?

126
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,260
Who's the most knowledgeable
person in this city?

127
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,210
Knowledgeable? What's that?

128
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,730
This guy doesn't know anything.

129
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,340
He's probably just an in-game character.

130
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,590
Oh, no! You did it!

131
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,600
Here is your prize, Galgaida.

132
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,100
"1217.

133
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,120
F-185."

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,580
What does that mean?

135
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,980
Is this your first time seeing a card?

136
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,760
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.

137
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,390
The left number is the item's card number,

138
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,990
and the sequence on the right
ranks how difficult it is to obtain.

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,750
There are ten ranks, from SS to H.

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,240
F would be the third easiest.

141
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,750
The number next to the rank is the item's
maximum transformation limit.

142
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,140
Oh, which means this item card...

143
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,260
Is nothing but junk.

144
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,980
I've never seen him around.

145
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,520
That's brutal.

146
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,900
He's one of the players who entered with us.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,290
Hey, what happened?

148
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,620
His body suddenly exploded.

149
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,030
From the inside.

150
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,370
We've only been inside the
game for a few hours,

151
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,530
and someone's already dead.

152
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,870
And this corpse has a very real presence.

153
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,910
Hard to believe it's a game.

154
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,690
We're risking our lives here.

155
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,470
He disappeared?

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,020
He probably went back to the real world.

157
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,670
Game over.

158
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,550
Hey, Killua.

159
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,930
Was the magic used on you earlier...

160
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,930
I don't know.

161
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,350
Don't worry.

162
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,190
There's no such spell in this game.

163
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,310
Spell?

164
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,110
As you just said, it's something like magic.

165
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,210
He died from another player's Nen.

166
00:09:59,210 --> 00:09:59,910
Nen ?

167
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Does that mean the players are
trying to kill each other?

168
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,990
Why?

169
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,610
Player hunting.

170
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,450
Player hunting?

171
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,670
I can explain later.

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,330
Anyway, are you interested in teaming up?

173
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,170
We know of a sure way to clear this game.

174
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,130
Huh?

175
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,430
If you're interested, follow me.

176
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,180
My allies are waiting ahead.

177
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,320
What do we do?

178
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,910
Sounds suspicious.

179
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,400
And we're already off to a bad start.

180
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,440
As I recall,

181
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,170
on your way here, another player
used an attack spell on you.

182
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,870
Have you been watching us?

183
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,700
Yeah.

184
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,480
And I wasn't the only one.

185
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,140
Lots of people keep an eye
on the starting point.

186
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
If you come, I'll explain why.

187
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,710
I can also tell you about the
spell that was cast on you.

188
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,970
You're being very nice.

189
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,470
There must be a catch.

190
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,970
We have no choice.

191
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,180
This game is difficult,
unpleasant, and frightening.

192
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,920
Once you realize that,

193
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,980
you'll be more willing to accept our offer.

194
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,570
Well, it's your first time playing,

195
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,110
so you could use the information...

196
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,270
What makes you think it's our first time?

197
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,490
We could be returning players.

198
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
Book.

199
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,580
This proves that you're beginners.

200
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,490
An experienced player would react
by summoning his own binder.

201
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,670
Because you need spell cards
to defend yourself.

202
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,400
Then the spell cast on Killua...

203
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,680
Could only be stopped by another card.

204
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,170
Even when you aren't carrying any cards,

205
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,600
you should still summon it.

206
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,260
It's an important bluff.

207
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,100
Book.

208
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,810
Hey, how do we obtain spell cards?

209
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,070
The easiest method would be to
go to Masadora, City of Magic.

210
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,860
Masadora?

211
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,620
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

212
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,620
Return on!

213
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,370
Take me to Masadora!

214
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,910
Killua, we should go with him.

215
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,370
I'm worried about the spell on you.

216
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,310
Okay?

217
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,540
Sure...

218
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,940
Is this everyone?

219
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,140
Yeah.

220
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,140
Everyone else turned me down.

221
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,210
Let's get started, then.

222
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,090
Another player was just killed.

223
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,930
He arrived with the rest of you.

224
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,160
His stomach exploded.

225
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,530
It was the Bomber.

226
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,580
The Bomber?

227
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,660
The victims aren't killed by spells.

228
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,090
No spell in this game is capable
of injuring people.

229
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,420
Which means that you won't be harmed or killed

230
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,680
by any spell that's been cast on you.

231
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,180
There are forty different spells.

232
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,800
The one cast on you was an inspection spell.

233
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,710
Either Trace or Adhesion.

234
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,940
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

235
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,120
In short,

236
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,990
once the enemy uses these on you,

237
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]

238
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,180
he will then know everything about you.

239
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,390
I get it.

240
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,530
That's why...

241
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,930
Some players wait near the starting point

242
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,950
in order to cast these spells on new players.

243
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,060
As soon as a player obtains a valuable card,

244
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,620
they'll show up and steal it.

245
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,580
In some cases, they kill their target.

246
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,470
Like the guy who just died?

247
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,120
I won't be that easy to kill.

248
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,470
No, he was killed by something else.

249
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,560
There is a violent faction hunting players.

250
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,730
This was done by one of them...

251
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,730
The Bomber.

252
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,170
Bomber...

253
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,830
In this game, there are three
ways to acquire item cards.

254
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,490
Do you know what they are?

255
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,990
Find them yourself.

256
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,740
Trade with other players.

257
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,160
Steal them from other players.

258
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,250
Yes, those are the three ways.

259
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,900
However,

260
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,750
the number of players stealing
from others has recently increased.

261
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,550
That's due to the card's difficulty to obtain
and the card transformation limit system.

262
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,880
Players who can't obtain cards themselves

263
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,310
choose to take them from others.

264
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,790
If those players resist, they're killed.

265
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,400
When they die, their ring disappears,
and their cards are lost.

266
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,800
However, it increases the transformation
limit of that type of card.

267
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,350
If you kill a player, you can't take his cards.

268
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,090
That rule was meant to keep
players from killing one another.

269
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,590
But now, it's backfiring.

270
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,710
It's been over ten years since the game's release.

271
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,810
If no one can find a way to beat it,

272
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,550
the killing will only continue.

273
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,940
That's why we're trying to end this mess.

274
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,050
We're recruiting allies to clear this game.

275
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,810
We need your help.

276
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,310
How do you plan to obtain cards?

277
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,430
1) Find them yourself.

278
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,060
2) Trade for them.

279
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,090
3) Steal them.

280
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,440
Which method will you use?

281
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,320
3...

282
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,620
I assume you mean to use all three methods,

283
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,680
but 3 will be the primary method.

284
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,830
What, so you'll still use force?

285
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,760
No!

286
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,450
We won't use violence to reach our goal.

287
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,670
Spells.

288
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,810
You'll use spells.

289
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,580
Am I right?

290
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,080
Correct.

291
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,570
There are certain spells for taking cards,

292
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,950
and there are cards that
defend against those spells.

293
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,600
We'll focus on monopolizing these cards.

294
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,570
We're going to use the very
card transformation limit

295
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,100
that's frustrated the players.

296
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,180
This is the only way to clear the game.

297
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,100
I have met many players, and they
all reached the same conclusion.

298
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,620
Even if you search for cards,
they'll be taken from you eventually.

299
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,620
Because this game is based on
players taking cards from each other.

300
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,780
We will ensure that we can take
cards from other players,

301
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,790
while mitigating our risk of losing cards.

302
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,720
You're leaving out something important.

303
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,250
Upon clearing the game,
how will you split the reward?

304
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,260
You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?

305
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,900
So you knew who we were when you invited us.

306
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah.

307
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,630
Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game.

308
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,470
That means the reward will be 50 billion.

309
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,020
We'll split it among everyone who helps.

310
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,730
Currently, we have fifty-three players.

311
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,880
It'll take two months to collect
the remaining spell cards,

312
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,030
and one month to get the cards we need.

313
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,980
We can finish in three months.

314
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,530
Of course, if you join us,

315
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,520
we'll remove any spells cast on you.

316
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,290
I'm in.

317
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,890
I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion.

318
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,300
But I like the three month schedule
for clearing the game.

319
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,830
What about you?

320
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,970
I have a question.

321
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,560
If I obtain an SS rank card on
my own, what's my cut?

322
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,940
Naturally, you'd receive 500 million
for a card of that rank.

323
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,320
Okay, I'm in.

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,820
What about you two?

325
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,070
Killua, sorry.

326
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,070
Hmm? What?

327
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm out.

328
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,580
I'm playing this game on my own.

329
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,490
You heard the leader.

330
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,830
I have to pass.

331
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,590
Hey, Gon! Wait up...

332
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,470
What about you?

333
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,750
We'll need you to first exit the game,

334
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,810
so the spells placed on you can be removed.

335
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,580
Once you're back in the game,
wait by the starting point.

336
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,310
We'll come get you.

337
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,860
If you have any cards in your free slots,

338
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,760
give them to me now.

339
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,760
Why?

340
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,000
When you leave the game,

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,830
the cards in your free slots disappear.

342
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,310
I believe your data automatically
saves when cards are

343
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,400
put in or removed from restricted slots.

344
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,350
Yes, but your data disappears

345
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,460
if you don't return within ten days.

346
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,110
If you don't return before then,
we'll assume that you gave up.

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,090
Got it?

348
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,100
Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally.

349
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,890
We don't know if anyone's watching.

350
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,350
Let's get started.

351
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,860
Leave
Send one
target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

352
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,860
I'll be using the Leave card.

353
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,610
Hey, Gon...

354
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,810
Will you explain what that was about?

355
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,680
Sorry, Killua.

356
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,910
I couldn't take it anymore.

357
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,000
I still don't get why you're apologizing.

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,600
But this means you'll be stuck
with that spell for a while.

359
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Oh, that's why.

360
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,260
It's not a big deal.

361
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,130
But you're playing this game

362
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,770
to help me find my dad...

363
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,390
You're wrong.

364
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,110
I'm playing this game because...

365
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,520
Anyway, why were you so mad?

366
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,050
Because they had nothing
but bad things to say about

367
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,030
the game Ging made, like how
it's based on killing and stealing.

368
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,850
I want to do what Ging said,
and enjoy the game.

369
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,190
When I first started,

370
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,040
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

371
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,600
That was because I thought all the
players enjoyed playing the game.

372
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,230
People have died.

373
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,840
But it's the player mentality,
not the game, that scares me.

374
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,550
They're willing to hurt others to get cards.

375
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,870
Really?

376
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,430
I think it makes sense.

377
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,370
Killua, you really mean that?

378
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,470
That's why this game is meant for Hunters.

379
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,420
But...

380
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,940
Killing is wrong.

381
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,450
I agree with you on that part.

382
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,510
But what if two players have a fair
fight with predetermined rules,

383
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,480
and the winner gets to take a card?

384
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,130
Th-That's acceptable.

385
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,830
See?

386
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,300
When that guy cast a spell on me

387
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,430
and when those guys carry out their plan,

388
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,840
they're just following the game's rules.

389
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,820
Yeah.

390
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,840
Though it does still feel lame.

391
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,050
Well, forget about them.

392
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,160
Let's enjoy this game.

393
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,480
Killua...

394
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,980
Hmm?

395
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,980
Thanks.

396
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,630
I'm glad you came with me.

397
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,480
No...

398
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,630
I'm glad I got to know you!

399
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,920
Cut it out, stupid.

400
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,790
You're embarrassing me.

401
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,990
Why? I really mean it.

402
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,490
You've got it backwards.

403
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,270
Gon, I should thank you.

404
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,660
I'm the one who's glad

405
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,910
that I got to know you...

406
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,910
I understand.

407
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,220
So that's why.

408
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,360
Such a beautiful thing, the friendship
and innocence of two young boys.

409
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,810
I feel like messing with them.

410
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,470
Gon and Killua have
reaffirmed their friendship.

411
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,480
But who is the girl watching them?

412
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,150
G.I. Tutorial

413
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,750
Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!

414
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,310
Today, we introduce the card Return.

415
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:19,250
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

416
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,610
This travel card lets you instantly warp

417
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,370
to a city you've visited before.

418
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,330
Return on!

419
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,650
Mito-san's place.

420
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,300
It only works for places inside the game.

421
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,250
Huh?

422
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

423
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,630
Next time: Reality x And x Raw.

424
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,820
If you polish a raw diamond, you can make it shine!

425
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,180
Hey, a shooting star!

426
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,350
Shiny.
