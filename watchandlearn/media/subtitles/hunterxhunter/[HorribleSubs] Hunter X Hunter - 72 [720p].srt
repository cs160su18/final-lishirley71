2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,050
Where is our friend?

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,240
Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,000
He's just up ahead.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,250
We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,250
We're willing to pay any price he asks.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,000
Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,100
I understand.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,360
After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise...

10
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,050
Chase x And x Chance

11
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,060
That's him.

12
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,230
How did you find him?

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
Hell if I'll tell you, fool.

14
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,820
You in the shadows,

15
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,820
was it through your power?

16
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,680
You didn't even use En.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Are you some kind of freak?

18
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,760
I recently completed a very entertaining battle.

19
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,450
I'm quite sensitive at the moment...

20
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,080
To calm myself down,

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,840
I rather feel like messing up
a complete stranger.

22
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,090
Damn.

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,950
Come on out.

24
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,300
Was my Zetsu not good enough?

25
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,570
No, it was perfect.

26
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,980
This guy is just insanely perceptive.

27
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,820
Here is Troupe member #4.

28
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,490
In other words, your replacement.

29
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,420
My name is Kalluto.

30
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,820
I cannot tell you how my power works,
but we found him by using it.

31
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,200
Ah...

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,370
You look very appetizing as well.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,030
Be careful.

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,870
He certainly isn't picky.

35
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,870
Hisoka, you'd better succeed.

36
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,580
You people are so tedious.

37
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,380
I certainly shall, for my own benefit.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,990
Are you serious about fighting the boss?

39
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,150
Of course I am.

40
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,870
Would you prefer that I survive,
or that Chrollo survives?

41
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,910
A stupid question.

42
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,890
Once you finish your job here,
you can die, for all I care.

43
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,890
And if I kill Chrollo, then what?

44
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,590
That would be impossible.

45
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,150
But I'll answer your question.

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,650
I would pursue you to the ends
of the Earth to kill you.

47
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,990
I like the sound of that...

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Our objective is

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,580
to obtain Breath of Archangel,
currently monopolized by Team Genthru.

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,390
We must force them to transform a card,

51
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,820
or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher.

52
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,520
And that's where Team Gon comes in.

53
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,090
While they may not have the
strength to win outright,

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,600
they are highly likely to deal serious
damage to a member of Team Genthru.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,100
If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,850
Voucher
A voucher that can be
exchanged for Breath
of Archangel. Can only
be obtained when
Breath of Archangel
has attained its card
transformation limit.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,090
our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,110
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,110
After that...

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,050
We only need Lucky Alexandrite!

61
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,070
And if we can buy three weeks for those kids,

62
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,860
they'll trade the card to us!

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,890
Yes.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,000
Right, it's time.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,150
Let's get going.

66
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,130
Cards Needed
Patch of Shore
Lucky Alexandrite

67
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,130
I believe I told you to come alone.

68
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,880
We weren't able to make a decision,

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,130
Cards Needed
Breath of Archangel
Lucky Alexandrite
Blue Planet

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,130
so we kept discussing it on our way here.

71
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,050
And we've finally reached a consensus.

72
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,890
We choose to fight!

73
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,890
Levy on!

74
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,730
Accompany on!

75
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,660
To Antokiba!

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,560
Book.

77
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,820
Check your cards.

78
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,000
Book!

79
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,090
It's okay.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,530
They only stole some useless
cards from my free slots.

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,370
Same here.

82
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,010
I didn't lose anything important.

83
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,620
Guess that settles it.

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,240
We take their cards and kill them.

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,410
They'll put up a fight.

86
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,920
Huh?

87
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,930
I don't know what's happened to them...

88
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,580
But their resolve was written all over their faces.

89
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,250
Six copies of Accompany,

90
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,840
twenty-four of Return,

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,430
nine copies of Castle Gate,

92
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,350
and two of Magnetic Force.

93
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,180
I spent all our money on them.

94
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,820
Okay, then we'll meet up in three days.

95
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,190
Use that time to earn money
and buy the cards we need.

96
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,480
Got it.

97
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,990
Do you think they'll come after us?

98
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,630
Not immediately.

99
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,700
We now have nearly twice the number
of Accompany cards as Genthru.

100
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,950
If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that.

101
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,910
Just you watch, Genthru...

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,040
This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.

103
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,920
A Few Days Later

104
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,890
Gyo!

105
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,680
Too slow!

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,250
Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,290
Act the second you feel my touch!

108
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,890
Osu!

109
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,310
Too slow.

110
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,000
Osu!

111
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,430
You're still too slow!

112
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,940
Osu!

113
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,630
Okay, let's take a ten-minute break.

114
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,420
Next, we'll start Emitter training.

115
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,950
Osu.

116
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,700
He's building his stamina...

117
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,180
But in the mere two weeks we have left,

118
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,540
I can only help him bolster his defense.

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
We need another weapon before we can fight.

120
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,670
Emitter training, level two.

121
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,670
Elevation!

122
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,550
You must maintain this stance,
while staying perfectly still,

123
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,970
and only by releasing aura.

124
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,570
If you can elevate around
at least that high, you pass.

125
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,570
Okay!

126
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,070
That training is a lot harder,

127
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,840
given that it's only a level higher.

128
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,900
Naturally... Because this is
really level-five training.

129
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,750
Five?

130
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,130
Are you sure you should skip levels like that?

131
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,810
Well, it's a gamble.

132
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,860
If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted
the three weeks we were given.

133
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,970
If we followed the proper sequence,
he could reach level three easily.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,110
But that wouldn't do him any
good in actual combat.

135
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,620
He needs an Emitter attack that
can push an opponent back

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,120
several meters with a direct hit.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,590
It must be that strong for
him to use it as a weapon.

138
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,460
So you jumped to level five...

139
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,420
But even if he clears the training,

140
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,480
the ability to send enemies flying
isn't a desicively lethal weapon.

141
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,230
Exactly right.

142
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,510
It's only meant to give him more options.

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,890
So have you made any progress on a plan?

144
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,390
First, can you tell me what your power is?

145
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,650
My job will be easier with that information.

146
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,390
I'll introduce you to my power.

147
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,410
Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.

148
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,840
She specializes in providing
massages of pure pleasure.

149
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,250
She'll burn off excess fat and guide both
your body and your soul to paradise.

150
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,590
When her aura, transformed into
special lotion, is applied to the skin,

151
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,420
it makes your skin look younger.

152
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,380
She can also use acupressure massage
to cleanse your body internally.

153
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,540
Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills...
any anomaly you have will vanish!

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,430
That's it?

155
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,110
Of course not!

156
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,760
She can also do chiropractic massages,
meditative massages, rolling massages...

157
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,440
And there's still much more!

158
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,970
Are you an idiot?!

159
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,890
That's totally worthless!

160
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,250
What are you talking about?!

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,780
That's the most useful power in the world!

162
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,090
This is why you're just a stupid old hag!

163
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,770
I dare you to say that again!

164
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,370
Return on!

165
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,300
To Soufrabi!

166
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,050
Wait up!

167
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,690
Was it them again?

168
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,940
Damn, they're getting pretty blatant...

169
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
They're definitely targeting us!

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
That isn't the issue.

171
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,040
How do they know where to find us?

172
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,150
If they were using Accompany or Magnetic
Force to move straight to us, we'd know,

173
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,390
but that isn't the case.

174
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,390
They're using hit and run tactics,
then making clean escapes.

175
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,870
We immediately move to a different location,
but before long, they find us.

176
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,080
They're using Nen.

177
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,310
If they aren't using a spell,
like homing or tracking,

178
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,090
one of their members must have
a Nen power similar to radar.

179
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,860
We can't defend against that!

180
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,840
What do we do?

181
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,850
We'll just have to use some force.

182
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,800
That's one copy of Accompany...

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,730
Take all his C-rank cards.

184
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,920
Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder...

185
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,490
He hasn't met them before.

186
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,180
Then he's clean.

187
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,440
Hey, have you heard of the bombers?

188
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,250
Yes, I've heard the rumors...

189
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,350
We are the bombers.

190
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,830
I just set a bomb on you.

191
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,230
I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish.

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,140
If you don't want to die,
bring me the cards I request.

193
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,010
Hey, here's another Accompany!

194
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,650
I'll set Steal in here....

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
Kess
Tsezgerra
Rodriot

196
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,030
Uh-oh!

197
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,020
Too bad!

198
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,040
You're out!

199
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,000
Crap...

200
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,470
What are those bastards thinking?!

201
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,640
They're camping outside the spell card store.

202
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,670
And they're attacking every player who
walks out with newly bought cards.

203
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,690
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]

204
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,690
This is pure speculation.

205
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,450
But they must be aware of me.

206
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,240
They've realized that someone new is
providing cards to Team Tsezgerra.

207
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,300
So to flush me out,

208
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,450
they check the binders of
anyone who exits the store,

209
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,550
disposing of everyone who's met one of you.

210
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,760
They also steal their cards.

211
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,090
They're primarily focused on obtaining
Accompany and Magnetic Force.

212
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,260
And any players that they free
once cleared of suspicion

213
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,100
are forced to collect cards for them.

214
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,160
By eliminating suspects and taking their cards,

215
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,930
they also cut off our supply.

216
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,950
They're killing three birds with one stone.

217
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,930
Got it.

218
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,730
We'll try to track their movements.

219
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,730
Get away from there and
wait for us to contact you.

220
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,250
Silent Worker: Fly on the Job

221
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,430
They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.

222
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,510
Okay, next we check their cards.

223
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,450
Together, those three have

224
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,930
sixteen copies of Accompany
and two of Magnetic Force.

225
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,320
That's a significant increase...

226
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,550
At this pace, they'll catch up
to us in four to five days.

227
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,140
But we expected that.

228
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,030
They're saying they won't move
until they have enough cards.

229
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,920
Everything is going well.

230
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,200
Twelve days left.

231
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,170
It's not working...

232
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,070
Listen to me.

233
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,180
While training, see yourself firing a water pistol.

234
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,290
You build up aura within your body,
then shoot it from your palm!

235
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:56,190
The greater your power,
the stronger the aura you fire.

236
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,880
You want to release all the aura
you've kept closed up inside.

237
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,600
The total amount of refined
aura you apply to the attack,

238
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,940
and the speed, power, and timing
you apply to the release...

239
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,080
You need all of those elements
to land the attack you'll require.

240
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,260
It's too hard!

241
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,910
I just don't get how you push the aura
in your body out of your hand...

242
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,590
He hasn't made any progress for ten days.

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,530
Maybe you should have let
him start from level two.

244
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,490
We still have ten more days...

245
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,980
Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.

246
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,300
In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal.

247
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,960
If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite,

248
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
they'll only be missing two cards.

249
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,040
We still need over thirty...

250
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,110
We can just take them from Genthru by force.

251
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,730
Gon would never accept that...

252
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,120
And we still have to figure out
how to defeat Genthru first.

253
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,710
That's true.

254
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,870
So is this big enough?

255
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,420
Yeah.

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,370
A Few Days Later

257
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,380
We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.

258
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,940
If you total their Accompany, Return,

259
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,310
and Magnetic Force cards,
they only have forty-five cards.

260
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,720
Now they can't evade us.

261
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,820
Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.

262
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,620
Accompany on!

263
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,650
Tsezgerra!

264
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,390
They're on the move!

265
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,400
They're coming our way at an incredible speed!

266
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,660
We move according to the plan!

267
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,820
Accompany on!

268
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,540
To Masadora!

269
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,100
Accompany on!

270
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,800
Tsezgerra!

271
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,970
Accompany on!

272
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,810
To Soufrabi!

273
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,990
Accompany on!

274
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,640
Tsezgerra!

275
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,240
Accompany on!

276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,020
To Masadora!

277
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,370
Accompany on!

278
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:08,900
Tsezgerra!

279
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,300
I'm out now.

280
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
Barry!

281
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,870
Roger that.

282
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,750
Accompany on!

283
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,910
To Soufrabi!

284
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,850
Damn, we only have five days left...

285
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,390
Don't you have any advice that
could help him break through?

286
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,690
The sensation of aura flowing through the body

287
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,890
is different for everyone.

288
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,110
If I give him advice from my own perception
and he makes incorrect assumptions,

289
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,850
it could end up hurting more than helping.

290
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,080
How many do we have left?

291
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,860
Seven copies of Accompany.

292
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,570
They aren't coming...

293
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,560
Did they give up?

294
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,310
No way.

295
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,060
They're taking their time to throw us off.

296
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,530
If we run out of Accompany,
we'll have to use Return.

297
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,600
Understood.

298
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,930
We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.

299
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,920
How's it going over there?

300
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,320
Let's find out.

301
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
Contact on.

302
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,180
Goreinu.

303
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,290
This is Tsezgerra.

304
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
How's it going there?

305
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,180
You were right.

306
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,530
Sub and Bara have appeared.

307
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,190
Most likely the real ones.

308
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,440
They're speculating that I'll try to buy
cards while they're playing tag.

309
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,420
Which means it's Genthru and a couple
of fakes that are chasing you.

310
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,780
Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!

311
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,830
The same trick won't work again.

312
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,580
Right now, Genthru is alone,
while there are four of us.

313
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,460
This is our chance!

314
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,710
No, I would prefer better odds for a fight.

315
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,860
We'll stick to the original plan.

316
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,290
Here they come.

317
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,760
We're back on the run!

318
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,930
Gon...

319
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,690
Time's up.

320
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,480
Your training's over.

321
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,480
We still have five days!

322
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,060
Change in plans.

323
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,400
I came up with a plan for defeating them.

324
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,110
But... But...

325
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,280
Uh, well...

326
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,210
I think I've almost got it.

327
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,200
Maybe...

328
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,420
No, it isn't happening.

329
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,120
And I can't use an unreliable
technique in my plan...

330
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,430
Give up.

331
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,590
So the plan is...

332
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,880
To use this.

333
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,150
Huh?

334
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,800
You'll have to learn this the hard way.

335
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,030
Until you get it down to perfection.

336
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,680
We're out of Accompany cards...

337
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,930
Use Return!

338
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,450
Return on!

339
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,460
To Aiai!

340
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,400
They're out of Accompany cards?

341
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,270
We're finally getting close.

342
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,350
Sub, Bara...

343
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,230
How's it going? Catch anyone?

344
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,620
Only one, and it was someone new to the game.

345
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,870
Word's out that the bombers are hunting

346
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,130
players around here, so everyone's staying away.

347
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,130
Could he have been someone
we already disposed of?

348
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,400
Perhaps...

349
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
Okay, come back.

350
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,030
I'm in Soufrabi now.

351
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,990
They're out of bullets.

352
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,770
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

353
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,770
We're finally down to our last card.

354
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,450
If they follow us outside the game,
we can fend them off at the mansion.

355
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,530
If they don't follow us, we just have
to wait until the time limit is up.

356
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,530
It's perfect...

357
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,150
All that's left is choosing the
three to keep for winning.

358
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,540
We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.

359
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,540
Okay, let's go!

360
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Leave!

361
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,030
No one's here.

362
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,190
What's going on?

363
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,690
Weren't armed guards standing by?

364
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,020
Sabazushi, where are you?

365
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,440
Answer if you're there!

366
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,980
Sabazushi!

367
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,450
Keep it down...

368
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,450
I was taking a nap.

369
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,870
A nap?

370
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,980
What happened to everyone else?

371
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,260
They left.

372
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,540
Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.

373
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,240
We received an intermediary fee
and a cancellation fee.

374
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,650
But I stayed behind because I
thought I should inform you.

375
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,060
Canceled?

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,010
Mr. Battera!

377
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,350
What is the meaning of this?!

378
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,180
We're so close!

379
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,020
We're close to beating the game!

380
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,210
It doesn't matter...

381
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,950
Doesn't matter anymore.

382
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,840
Doesn't matter?!

383
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,680
That's crap!

384
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,030
What about all the time and effort we've spent?

385
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,370
My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.

386
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,620
You can do whatever you want with the cards.

387
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,430
So now,

388
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,250
just leave me alone...

389
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,190
Damn!

390
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,860
What's going on?

391
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,050
I don't know.

392
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,490
Why did this happen?

393
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,380
We're free to kill them out here.

394
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,850
Since their ring data won't disappear.

395
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,790
Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his
friends the time that they promised.

396
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,160
But awaiting them was a
situation they didn't expect.

397
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,070
G.I. Tutorial

398
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,840
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

399
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,080
Today, we introduce the card Fake.

400
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:19,530
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]

401
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,260
It can transform into any card from 001 to 099.

402
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,230
But it doesn't count toward binder completion.

403
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,160
And it can't be transformed into an item.

404
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,540
Funny face!

405
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue?

406
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,720
Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity.

407
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,550
Hey, Gon,

408
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,980
want to see my special attack?

409
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,990
I sure do!

410
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,850
You'll have to wait till next week!

411
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,420
Are you insane?
