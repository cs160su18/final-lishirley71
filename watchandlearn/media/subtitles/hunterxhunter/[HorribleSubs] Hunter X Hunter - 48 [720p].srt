2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,730
No good...

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,670
I've got nothing.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,980
That two billion reward
per spider is attractive,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,670
but finding them will be impossible.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,670
Yeah...

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,050
Hey, we could ask for concrete
information on the Net.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,000
Like about the Troupe's current location.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,250
We could offer a large reward.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,640
Hold on...

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,490
We don't have the money for that.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,500
It'll be fine.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,050
Very x Sharp x Eye

14
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,680
Gon and his friends are
pursuing the Phantom Troupe,

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,980
and have now obtained the money

16
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,980
to buy the information they need.

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,900
That's crazy...

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,940
You actually have money.

19
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Man, you really pawned
your Hunter License?

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
You're insane.

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,280
So, what should we do first?

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,790
Let's start by purchasing
a Southernbees catalog.

23
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,120
Here is this year's
Southernbees auction catalog.

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,160
Thanks.

25
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,580
There it is!

26
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,870
Greed Island !

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,180
Seven total copies on sale...

28
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,440
The minimum starting bid is 8.9 billion.

29
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,850
Just as expected.

30
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,200
Now we wait for the
information to come in.

31
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,330
First, we catch one of the spiders
and make them tell us where

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,470
the rest are hiding,
so that we can bag them all!

33
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,200
Huh?

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,710
What's wrong, Gon?

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,210
This is...

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,330
Oh, a Ben's knife.

37
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,590
A Ben's knife?

38
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,440
A hundred years ago,
a mass murderer designed it.

39
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,990
He was a famous blacksmith.

40
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,310
This is one of his original works.

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,510
It's a lesser-known piece that a
lot of rabid collectors are after.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,300
So, you recognized it.

43
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,440
No, I didn't.

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,290
Huh?

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,070
It happened to catch my eye,
so I got curious

46
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,810
and I used Gyo.

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,960
That's when I noticed a faint aura on it.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,700
Gyo ?

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,580
A form of Nen.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,830
Basically, you look really
hard at something.

51
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,930
You're right.

52
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,340
Let me have a look.

53
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,840
Nope, I don't see a thing.

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,710
You will, once you spend
more time training in Ren.

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,260
Right! There's another way!

56
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,250
Another way?

57
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,680
Another way to make money.

58
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,810
Remember how four-eyes mentioned that

59
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,820
really talented people use Nen without
even realizing it themselves?

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,820
Four-eyes?

61
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,820
Wing-san.

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,570
He taught us Nen.

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,050
If we search for items with
aura on them, like this knife,

64
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,710
it's likely some genius made them.

65
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,210
I get it!

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,010
We can find hidden gems

67
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,340
with no formal appraisal training.

68
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,090
Then we auction the items at a higher price!

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,840
If you guys want that,
write down your price.

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,980
Customers are supposed to
name their own prices?

71
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,230
Yeah, that's how this market works.

72
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,020
You write down what you're willing to pay,

73
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,480
and when time expires,
the highest bidder wins the item.

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,610
Understand? Popular items

75
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,260
will see their prices shoot up.

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,120
I get it now.

77
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,930
Well, then let's get started.

78
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,780
I'll check the online forums.

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,570
Okay!

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,410
This is a weird pot, but I detect aura...

81
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,020
Someone already bid!

82
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,270
If a bid has already been placed,
enter one that's 2.5 times higher.

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,780
Even if you end up bidding too high,
you'll succeed in discouraging any rivals.

84
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,280
500 multiplied by 2.5...

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,360
Let's see...

86
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,560
It's the same person!

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,480
Same on your side?

88
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,550
I found a couple items,

89
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,680
but both had bids already placed by "Zepile."

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,030
And after I entered a bid 2.5 times higher,

91
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,640
he multiplied that by 4.

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,930
Then it isn't a coincidence?

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,590
No.

94
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,890
What should we do?

95
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,940
Keep placing bids until the deadline.

96
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,590
There are two of us, so we'll win some!

97
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,020
Okay.

98
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,870
So ultimately, we won three and lost one.

99
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,450
Yeah, he got that weird pot.

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,470
Well, that wasn't too bad.

101
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,520
Let's take these to the auction house now.

102
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,000
I am very sorry.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,010
But the auction house cannot
accept any additional items,

104
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,220
once the catalog has been published.

105
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,060
Isn't there any way?

106
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,730
We really want to auction these.

107
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,120
I suggest that you give
the trade market a try.

108
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,620
The trade market?

109
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,800
The trade market...

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,870
Professionals will be here, so if one of these
is genuine, we should get a great price.

111
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,490
I wanted to sell these at the auction, though.

112
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,120
How much do you think we'll get?

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,380
Let's find out.

114
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,260
Oh, you found these in your cellar?

115
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,540
Yep!

116
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,350
Dad said to sell them if the price was right.

117
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,280
These are wonderful pieces.

118
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,020
Only fifty copies were printed, and yours has

119
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,250
a single-digit serial number.

120
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,520
And an authentic autograph.

121
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,600
We know.

122
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,950
That's where the aura was coming from.

123
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,450
I'd guess it's worth at least 150,000.

124
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,780
This antique doll is also excellent...

125
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,200
It's in great shape,

126
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,540
and the pristine condition of both
box and doll raises the value.

127
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm estimating 300,000.

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,670
However,

129
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,670
this one isn't worth much, unfortunately.

130
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,680
Huh?

131
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,680
The box and statue are
from different periods.

132
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,770
The box was made recently.

133
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,270
The statue is rough and doesn't
adhere to any theme.

134
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,190
I'd say it's only worth 1,500 Jenny.

135
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,190
But there is a little aura...

136
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,480
However, that would be its
appraisal as an artwork.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,390
The wood itself is quite valuable.

138
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,200
So I'll make you an offer.

139
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,530
If you sell me the painting
and doll for 420,000,

140
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,710
I'll buy the wood for 80,000.

141
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
A total of 500,000?

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,340
What do you think?

143
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,720
Feel free to think it over.

144
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,720
But I doubt anyone will quote
you a better price.

145
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
In the meantime, let me
check this wood's age.

146
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,220
Wait!

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,900
Put down that statue.

148
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,480
Wh-Who are you?

149
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,070
Don't let him scam you, kid.

150
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,520
He's offering a fair price
for the painting and doll,

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,490
but he's lying about the statue!

152
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,520
I-I never lied!

153
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,240
Really?

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,660
No collector would pay
80,000 for that wood.

155
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,000
You're interested in

156
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,620
the contents of that statue!

157
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,400
It's a wooden trove.

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,840
A wooden trove?

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,690
Three hundred years ago,

160
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,540
these were a popular way for the
wealthy to hide their money.

161
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,230
To hide their money...

162
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,320
If it's real, there should be valuables inside.

163
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,490
You planned to steal the contents,
while pretending to check its age!

164
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,970
I-I would never do that...

165
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,120
Wait.

166
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,850
Can you prove that this is
a genuine wooden trove?

167
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,120
What?

168
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,320
The wood is certainly over
three hundred years old.

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,510
But that only tells us the material's age.

170
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,330
The statue itself could be modern.

171
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,710
This technique is known as hoodwinking, boys.

172
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,140
Technique?

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,520
He's referring to a counterfeiter trying
to trick a professional appraiser.

174
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,020
But that isn't what I'm doing.

175
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,320
Here's a seam that an amateur

176
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,030
would never recognize.

177
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,690
The seam contains an adhesive

178
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,280
used back in that period.

179
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,890
You're insisting this is a real wooden trove?

180
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,910
Yeah.

181
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,410
But it is possible that it was opened
once to swap out its contents,

182
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,170
and the statue was reassembled.

183
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,670
We'd call that a dud.

184
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,380
It's called double-dipping,

185
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,430
placing new adhesive on top
of the old to create a dud.

186
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,930
But only an amateur would try that.

187
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,570
A professional would melt
the adhesive with a flame,

188
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,940
before resealing it.

189
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,200
That way, it would appear as though
the statue had never been opened.

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,140
That's known as welding.

191
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,820
It hasn't been welded.

192
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,450
If fire were used, the wood would be scarred
or the adhesive would have discolored.

193
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,830
Even the pros have a hard time
weighing those details.

194
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,800
I can't trust you.

195
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm a pro appraiser!

196
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,960
I swear by my eyes...

197
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,630
This is a real wooden trove!

198
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,670
It's never been opened,

199
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,760
and the treasure inside
hasn't been swapped out!

200
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,360
Okay,

201
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,020
let's assume that this is a
genuine wooden trove.

202
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,450
If the contents have been swapped out,

203
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,150
what would you do?

204
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,030
I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.

205
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,310
Give up.

206
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,790
Wow! Awesome!

207
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,560
Oh, so you're Zepile.

208
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,960
Thanks, Zepile-san.

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,860
You don't need to thank me.

210
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,010
Consider it give and take.

211
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,320
Twenty percent sounds fair.

212
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,120
Huh?

213
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,030
My cut when you sell the treasure.

214
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,860
What?

215
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,700
You're going to rob us?!

216
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,910
That's uncalled for.

217
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,450
It's my fee for providing advice.

218
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,120
I don't see a problem.

219
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,990
He helped us back there.

220
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,460
Now, look here...

221
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,060
We need to collect as much
Jenny as we possibly can.

222
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,360
I might be willing to buy him lunch.

223
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,300
Really?

224
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,970
Then I'll settle for that.

225
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,220
Huh?

226
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,230
So, Zepile-san...

227
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,270
Hmm?

228
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,960
I feel bad, so we'll pay you a fee.

229
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,610
There you go again!

230
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,180
Nah, it really is okay.

231
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,480
In return, just tell me something.

232
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,110
What tipped you off to bid on these items?

233
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,940
Is it okay to tell him the truth?

234
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,370
Well, it beats paying him.

235
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,870
I see, Nen aura...

236
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,680
If you're telling the truth,

237
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,150
that explains why you bought the statue,

238
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,130
not realizing something was hidden inside.

239
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,890
So, why do you need money so badly?

240
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,280
We can answer that question,
but not for free.

241
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,670
Afterwards, you have to answer our question.

242
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,270
Sure, that's fine.

243
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,360
There's an item we want
to buy at the auction.

244
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
That's why we need money.

245
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,990
Oh, which item are you interested in?

246
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,900
It's our turn now.

247
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,460
You estimated that this treasure
was worth 300 million, right?

248
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,290
Could we receive that much
at the trade market?

249
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,370
At the trade market?

250
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,700
They mainly deal in hard cash...

251
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,550
If you show up abruptly,
you won't get a fair price.

252
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,560
What?

253
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,660
Seriously?

254
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,000
Now it's my turn.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,590
I'll repeat the question.

256
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,960
Which item do you want?

257
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,310
A game called Greed Island.

258
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,310
Oh, that ridiculously expensive game?

259
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,820
How much is that weird pot
that you bought worth?

260
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
Huh? This?

261
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,370
It's garbage.

262
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,700
Nothing at all.

263
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,100
Why do you want that expensive game?

264
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,170
I believe it costs 6 billion?

265
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,950
The asking price is 8.9 billion.

266
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,100
We're looking for his dad.

267
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,960
That game has a clue inside.

268
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,570
Oh...

269
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,530
Why did you choose that pot?

270
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,250
If you knew the wooden trove was real,

271
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,830
shouldn't you have bid on
the more valuable item?

272
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,220
But you went for the pot.

273
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,350
Why?

274
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,120
You see...

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,600
I made this pot.

276
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,860
Huh?

277
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,770
But it wasn't an original creation.

278
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,050
It was a replica.

279
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,860
In other words, a counterfeit.

280
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,160
When I was destitute,
this was how I made Jenny.

281
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,990
Once I became an appraiser
and began earning money,

282
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,700
I quit doing that.

283
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,520
When I see how poorly these are made,

284
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,880
I feel mortified!

285
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,630
So I browse the markets and buy them back.

286
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,750
How much would a real one cost?

287
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,580
It's my turn.

288
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,270
What does your dad do?

289
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,140
He's a pro Hunter.

290
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,400
How much would a real one cost?!

291
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,960
Forty to fifty thousand.

292
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,180
Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?

293
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,860
There are a few in the antiques world,

294
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,030
and not one of them is ordinary.

295
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,950
Won't it be impossible for you
two to find him alone?

296
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,920
It'll be fine.
I'm a pro Hunter, too.

297
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,670
Huh? Seriously?

298
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,670
Okay, your turn to ask a question.

299
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,160
Okay, this is my final question.

300
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,930
Can I help you with anything?

301
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,970
Huh?

302
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,690
If you want to make money at an auction,
you'll need an appraiser.

303
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,710
You could even say that with an appraiser,

304
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,100
you can always turn a profit.

305
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,190
You can set the price you want to pay me.

306
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,110
How's that?

307
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,450
Then you have to answer our last question.

308
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,300
Why do you want to help us?

309
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,720
Because it made me happy...

310
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,350
It made me happy that this piece of junk

311
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,840
actually caught your eye.

312
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,720
It's not a piece of junk!

313
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,470
It definitely holds your Nen.

314
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,850
Everyone has some aura...

315
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:27,480
But it's incredibly difficult to harness!

316
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,430
You must concentrate and
train for a very long time.

317
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,860
I can tell how much effort you
put into making that pot!

318
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,820
You have a lot of talent!

319
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,870
I still think it's a weird pot, though.

320
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,880
My eyes didn't deceive me.

321
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,710
When you appraise objects long enough,

322
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,880
you also become a good judge of character.

323
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,530
I look at the sellers and the buyers too,
not just the merchandise.

324
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,070
It's a lot harder to appraise humans

325
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,730
than it is to appraise antiques.

326
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,580
When I saw you, I knew right away...

327
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,400
That I wanted to work with you.

328
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,290
That's my answer.

329
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,590
What's yours?

330
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,940
Looking forward to it.

331
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,660
We'll decide your fee after
we see how you do.

332
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,470
Okay! With that settled...

333
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,680
But first...

334
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,290
Huh?

335
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
Teach me those techniques

336
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,300
you talked about earlier.

337
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,440
You're interested?

338
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,180
Yep!

339
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,900
Hoodwinking, double-dipping, welding...

340
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,710
What else is there?

341
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,850
Seriously...

342
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,680
That isn't important at all!

343
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
But they sound fun!
Like magic tricks!

344
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,750
We're not here to have fun!

345
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Now I understand why this kid interests me.

346
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,200
He doesn't care about right or wrong.

347
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,950
When I admitted to making forgeries

348
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,960
and when that trader gave me a hard time...

349
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,020
He didn't react with accusatory glares

350
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,460
or by plotting his own evil deeds.

351
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,210
His reaction was very simple.

352
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,360
Innocent curiosity!

353
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,720
He opens his mind to everything that
impresses him, right or wrong.

354
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,730
Which means that he's dangerous...

355
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,090
Someone who can never truly be appraised.

356
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,740
Welding is the hardest
technique to see through.

357
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,480
But recently, a new technique has surfaced.

358
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,750
It's known as exposing.

359
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,520
You plainly reveal the opened statue

360
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,500
along with a fake treasure.

361
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,130
Because people assume

362
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,110
that you wouldn't open the statue
if the treasure were fake,

363
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,010
you can fool them.

364
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,270
But now this technique is getting old.

365
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,710
When people started to get suspicious,
a new technique emerged.

366
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,020
Can you guess what it is?

367
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,340
I know.

368
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,220
The treasure inside is also fake!

369
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,260
Wrong!

370
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,300
I know!

371
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,410
Remove the treasure from a different place!

372
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,760
Bingo!

373
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,510
You can create a new opening
and remove the treasure,

374
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,270
then insert the fake
treasure and seal the hole.

375
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,170
This is known as side-stepping.

376
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,610
Side-stepping...

377
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,990
Many veteran appraisers have been fooled.

378
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,280
They assume the statue is real if the
adhesive hasn't changed color

379
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,810
from the application of fire.

380
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,760
That's how they fool the pros.

381
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,250
You live in an incredible world.

382
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,500
Hello?

383
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,070
What? A spider?

384
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,570
Yeah, this looks real.

385
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,970
There's a video attached.

386
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,200
We have two targets.

387
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,200
A man and a woman.

388
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,550
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.

389
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,710
Got it.

390
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,680
Let's go, Killua.

391
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,480
Yeah.

392
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,720
Hey! What about the auction?

393
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,160
We'll let you handle it!

394
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,970
Try to get us a good price!

395
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,220
Huh?

396
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,230
Okay! I've got it covered!

397
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,750
Gon and Killua have learned
about a whole new world.

398
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,280
And they are about to make
contact with the Phantom Troupe.

399
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,740
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

400
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,280
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

401
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

402
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

403
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

404
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,700
It's Gon

405
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,480
and Killua's

406
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,710
Hunterpedia!

407
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:20,000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

408
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,340
Today, we introduce Shizuku.

409
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,740
A Phantom Troupe member.

410
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,320
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

411
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,190
She can conjure the vacuum cleaner Blinky.

412
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:20,000
Conjurer who uses a conjured
vacuum named Blinky.

413
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,620
But it can't suck up anything alive.

414
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,120
Its capacity is immeasurable!

415
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,910
Where do you go if you're sucked in?

416
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,290
No one knows.

417
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,960
Next Time: Pursuit x And x Analysis.

418
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,340
Right or left?

419
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,090
Right.

420
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,970
Do we go after the man or the woman?

421
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,970
The woman.

422
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,140
Should I use red or blue?

423
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,850
You can decide that for yourself!
