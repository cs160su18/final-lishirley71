2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,010
Heavens Arena.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,990
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,530
When combatants win a fight,

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,420
they may advance by one class,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,460
and receive a corresponding reward.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,030
After reaching the 100th floor,

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,170
you are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,600
After reaching the 200th floor,

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,010
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,880
This is the best stage

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,890
a warrior could ask for.

14
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,270
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,980
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,650
I'll agree to the full learning process

17
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,650
rather than a quick explanation!

18
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,160
I understand.

19
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Nen x And x Nen

20
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,420
After Killua fought Zushi,

21
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,300
the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,

22
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,500
Zushi mentioned the four major principles.

23
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,600
Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,250
of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing.

25
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,900
Do I have your attention?

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,940
Nen means to burn your own soul.

27
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,310
In other words,

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,260
it tests your strength of will.

29
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,320
Burn

30
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,320
Nen

31
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,340
And the four major principles are part

32
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,820
of a training curriculum for
strengthening your will.

33
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,010
Strengthening your will?

34
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,110
Training?

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,700
That's correct.

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,290
Ten

37
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,580
Focus

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,920
Ten means to focus your soul to a single point,

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,510
to increase awareness of your ego and goals.

40
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,500
Express

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,210
Zetsu

42
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,540
Zetsu means to express yourself in words.

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,090
Temper

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,670
Ren

45
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,690
Ren means to temper that will.

46
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,470
Act

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,130
Hatsu

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,470
And Hatsu means to act upon that will.

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,100
Focus
Express
Temper
Act

50
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,100
Four Major Principles

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,310
Ten.

52
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,180
Zetsu.

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,070
Ren.

54
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,260
Hatsu.

55
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,100
Those are the four major principles.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his "refusal
to lose," during his fight with you.

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,230
So, allow me to demonstrate.

58
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,120
Killua-kun...

59
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,310
I think I'm going to kill you now.

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,330
Are you ready?

61
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,710
Yeah, sure.

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,630
It's not happening.

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,380
Then I'll take this step-by-step.

64
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,380
First comes Ten.

65
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,270
I focus my soul into a single point.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,810
Zetsu.

67
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,890
You can express yourself mentally or verbally.

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,400
I will kill you.

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,110
That was Ren.

70
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,700
If I temper my will enough,

71
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,950
then I can act. Hatsu.

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,210
If your will is strong enough,

73
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,600
you can make your opponent back down,
without moving a muscle.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,010
The concept of bluffing derives from this.

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Ren hardens that which is soft,

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,170
and you lose the ability to
correct an incorrect idea.

77
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,360
Therefore, you should avoid using Ren

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,390
until your soul has fully matured.

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,560
Right now, you boys and Zushi
should be training your souls.

80
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,880
Let's go, Gon.

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,180
If you wish to learn about Nen,

82
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,450
you should focus on mastering Ten.

83
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,990
If you master Ten,

84
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,960
you will no longer feel the pressure
of an opponent's will.

85
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,400
Thank you very much!

86
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,850
Wait up, Killua!

87
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,720
Zushi.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,690
Let's begin training.

90
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,840
O-Osu!

91
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,380
First...

92
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,600
He was lying?

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,920
Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense,

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,490
and Wing is clearly very strong.

95
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,510
But his story had holes.

96
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,240
Huh?

97
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,470
Zushi's toughness.

98
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,620
He kept getting up after
I knocked him down.

99
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,800
I was getting irritated,

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,920
so I used all of my strength
during my last attack.

101
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,630
Brat!

102
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Crap!

103
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,870
He flew out of the ring!

104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,000
Even an amateur can see that
he's headed for the hospital!

105
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,110
Oh! He stood back up.

106
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,020
Zushi must be invincible.

107
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,550
Impossible.

108
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,430
However, the referee has awarded
a critical hit and knockdown.

109
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,390
Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points.

110
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,050
Willpower didn't keep him standing.

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
He's hiding some other secret.

112
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,200
What's wrong, Zushi?

113
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,450
Your Ten is unstable.

114
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,670
Master...

115
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,450
Hmm?

116
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,460
Why did you lie to them?

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,740
Lie?

118
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,060
You mean my explanation?

119
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,090
Yes!

120
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,830
The four major principles are
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu.

121
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,090
But they don't mean what you said.

122
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,350
Did you lie because they aren't your students?

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
I didn't lie.

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,750
Nen is an important method
for training your soul.

125
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,360
Force

126
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,800
However, it's true that I can't teach Nen

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,340
to someone who is not a student.

128
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,060
So I used the other Nen as a hint,
to help them along.

129
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,000
If Nen is used the wrong way,

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,250
it can become a terrible weapon.

131
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,930
For example...

132
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,790
You could turn a piece of paper
into a blade to harm others,

133
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,290
while hardening your body,
as a defensive measure.

134
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,690
With enough work, anyone can use Nen.

135
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,340
That is why

136
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,940
you must be careful when
deciding to teach it.

137
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,170
Master...

138
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,430
I didn't

139
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,610
have a chance to read that book yet...

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,800
And that can of juice was mine...

141
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,010
S-Sorry...

142
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,730
It's time for the day's biggest match!

143
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,800
The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced

144
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,210
to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.

145
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,220
Will they be able to keep moving on?

146
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,090
Okay, everyone...

147
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,860
Get ready to press your gamble switches!

148
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,600
Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me.

149
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,350
That's because

150
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,310
I am as slippery as a snake,

151
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,360
with sharp fangs,
to bite at your vital points.

152
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,440
You may sport a vicious chop,

153
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,770
but you can't overcome these muscles!

154
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,170
That's because...

155
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,750
I'm totally ripped!

156
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,880
Begin!

157
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,460
Critical hit and knockdown...

158
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,700
Three points.

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,360
Knockout!

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,330
The winner is Gon!

161
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,780
Critical hit and knockdown...

162
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,960
Three points.

163
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Knockout!

164
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,710
The winner is Killua!

165
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,360
Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked
out their opponents with one attack.

166
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,820
And both of them have
successfully cleared the 190s!

167
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,850
Both have advanced to the 200s!

168
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,670
They've already reached the 200s?!

169
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,690
Zushi.

170
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,030
Master!

171
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,160
Killua-kun and Gon-kun have
already reached the 200s?

172
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,870
Yes, they're amazing!

173
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,900
I need to train more...

174
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,960
Huh?

175
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,350
Master?

176
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,640
I have no choice.

177
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,930
Enjoy.

178
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,870
What's the 200th floor like?

179
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,980
Beats me.

180
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,030
I've never been up here before.

181
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,470
Wow!

182
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,600
The 200th floor is so fancy!

183
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,050
Where's the receptionist?

184
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,270
This way?

185
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,510
We finally made it.

186
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,430
Yeah.

187
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,000
What is this?

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,550
All of a sudden, it feels like
we're in a monster-filled jungle.

189
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,430
But this is an ordinary hallway.

190
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,830
Let's go.

191
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,990
We can do this!

192
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,790
This isn't working...

193
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,390
I can't move forward!

194
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,900
I don't want to move forward...

195
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,990
This is murderous intent,

196
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,490
aimed at us.

197
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,050
Hey! Who's there?

198
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,500
Show yourself!

199
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,230
Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?

200
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,140
The receptionist's desk is over here,

201
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,890
so please register for a 200s match today.

202
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,610
You won't be able to register

203
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,760
after midnight, so please be careful.

204
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,850
Was she the source of all that?

205
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,650
I can't tell.

206
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
By the way, there are currently

207
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,250
one hundred, seventy-three
contestants in the 200s class.

208
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,150
And starting from the 200s,

209
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,940
all weapons are allowed in matches.

210
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,920
So please use whatever you have.

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,300
Also, you will no longer receive
prize money in the 200s class.

212
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,530
You will fight only for glory,

213
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,060
so please understand that
if you're going to participate.

214
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,840
Huh?!

215
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,550
H-Hisoka...

216
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,960
Why are you here?

217
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,990
It's hardly that strange.

218
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,660
I love to fight,

219
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,130
and this is a temple to fighting.

220
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,100
And why are you here?

221
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,310
Just kidding...

222
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,610
This was no coincidence.

223
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,520
I've been waiting for you.

224
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,860
Remember how you ordered airship
tickets over the cybernet?

225
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,250
With a little effort,

226
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,660
it's possible to determine where
and when someone will arrive.

227
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,690
Well,

228
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,070
I knew you would come here eventually.

229
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,620
And so,

230
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,130
as a veteran, I have a warning for you.

231
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,260
It's still too early for you boys

232
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,760
to step on this floor.

233
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,210
How early depends on your efforts.

234
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,270
Leave for now.

235
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,740
It's too early right now.

236
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,030
That's stupid!

237
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,810
We just got up here...

238
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,690
I won't let you pass.

239
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,080
Not that you could, anyway.

240
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Wh-What is...

241
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,790
...this?

242
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,860
Don't be reckless!

243
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,970
Wing-san!

244
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,440
You have no defense

245
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,170
against his Nen.

246
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,070
Nen?

247
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,400
Right now, you are like someone standing

248
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,450
naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold.

249
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,730
If you continue to strain
your body, you may die.

250
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,350
This is Nen?!

251
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,710
He can stop us from moving
forward through willpower?

252
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,230
Don't lie!

253
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,210
Yes, I was lying.

254
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,720
Though technically, I wasn't lying completely.

255
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,570
I will teach you the truth about Nen.

256
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,850
So retreat for now.

257
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,640
Hey, receptionist lady.

258
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh, yes?

259
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,850
What happens if we don't register
for a fight today?

260
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,620
Gon-sama, you would have to
start again, from the first floor.

261
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,240
However, Killua-sama

262
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,880
refused to register once before.

263
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,550
So if he fails to register again,

264
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,490
his commitment will be questioned,

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,250
and he will be banned from participating.

266
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
Hey, Wing-san.

267
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,630
If we back down now,

268
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,380
will we be able to return here

269
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,750
by midnight?

270
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,020
That depends on you.

271
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,530
Simply put,

272
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,070
this is Nen.

273
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,950
Nen refers to the ability

274
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,160
to manipulate your aura,

275
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,160
Force

276
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,160
Nen

277
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,160
also known as life energy.

278
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,920
Every person possesses a
small amount of life energy.

279
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,670
But in most cases, it's simply discharged.

280
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,410
The ability to build up

281
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,430
a shroud of life energy is known as Ten.

282
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,430
Shroud

283
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,670
You can make your body harder,

284
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,250
Ten

285
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,250
Shroud

286
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,620
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

287
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,210
Then comes Zetsu.

288
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,170
Null

289
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,170
Zetsu

290
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,710
As you may guess, this nullifies your aura.

291
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,070
It is effective for

292
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,450
concealing your presence,
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

293
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,140
Which brings us to Ren.

294
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,080
Enhance

295
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,200
Ren

296
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,830
A technique to create an especially strong aura.

297
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,840
Can you feel that?

298
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,020
Yeah, I can feel the pressure.

299
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,680
But it doesn't feel dangerous.

300
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,690
That's because I have no hostile intent.

301
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,300
However, I must admit I am
impressed by their senses.

302
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,910
Perhaps it's because of
how they've grown up.

303
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,710
But their natural potential is
also a major factor.

304
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,360
Aura is an energy that comes
from within humans.

305
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,500
Which makes it very effective
against other humans.

306
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,500
For better or worse.

307
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,870
If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent,

308
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,880
you can use aura to kill.

309
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,840
Only one thing can protect you

310
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,510
from someone who uses Nen.

311
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,550
You must also learn to use Nen.

312
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,130
You must use Ten for defense.

313
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,270
Block the other person's aura with your own.

314
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,490
Otherwise...

315
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,050
Your body will be crushed.

316
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,090
Hisoka blocks the path leading
beyond the 200th floor.

317
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,410
Will Gon and Killua be able

318
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,690
to learn enough about

319
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,810
true Nen to pass Hisoka,

320
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,410
and reach the receptionist,
before the clock strikes midnight?

321
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,660
It's too early.

322
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,870
Coming up, we have Gon

323
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,710
and Killua's

324
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,330
Hunterpedia!

325
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,490
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

326
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

327
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

328
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,390
and Killua's

329
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,000
Hunterpedia!

330
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:18,580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

331
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,030
Today, we introduce Wing-san!

332
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,200
Master of Shingen-ryu.
Zushi's teacher.

333
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,210
He's Zushi's teacher!

334
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,000
And a master of Shingen-ryu!

335
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,160
Very serious about teaching Nen,

336
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,770
Seems he's pretty good with Nen.

337
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,850
but sloppy about everything else.

338
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,740
Oh, Wing-san's shirt isn't tucked in.

339
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,870
And his hair's a mess!
