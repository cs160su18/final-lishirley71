2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,440
We didn't learn what happened to Uvo,

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,820
but we have the chain user's name and face.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,130
We still don't know his abilities.

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,700
All right.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,080
We'll be waiting in the Hotel Beitacle lobby.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,580
It sounds like we got the
chain user's identity.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,690
He has three remaining allies.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,090
Let's go.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,600
Let's go.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,960
What do we do?

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,540
There isn't any point in
capturing Pakunoda now.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,060
If I were Kurapika, I would switch targets.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,820
If I wanted to crush the Troupe,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,600
I would target the boss.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,580
Melody's listening in on the conversation,

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,770
so they should know where we're going.

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,940
It's a question of when he'll attack.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,370
We'll need to confer before we move.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,370
The first instant will decide it.

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,960
Any slight delay could cost us our lives.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Initiative x And x Law

23
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,510
Wait here.

24
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,520
They're too alert...

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,860
They'll be watching anyone who walks in.

26
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,730
I hope Kurapika and Melody
arrived before us.

27
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,030
Hey!

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,280
Do you realize what time it is?!

29
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,970
Idiot! It's Hotel Beitacle!

30
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,170
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

31
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,290
Leorio!

32
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,670
What are you looking at, eh?

33
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,180
Should I get rid of him?

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,170
Ignore him.

35
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,420
Don't look at him.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,540
Eh? This ain't no show!

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,680
Damn, my future's dark

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,730
because of the failures working for me!

39
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,620
Listen up!

40
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,560
This once, I'll close my eyes
like nothing happened.

41
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,560
One more mistake, and you'll get it good!

42
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,320
Now listen.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,000
Seven on the dot.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
You'd best be at the hotel by then!

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,120
That's a message!

46
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,920
Seven on the dot!

47
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,440
Use darkness to our advantage!

48
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,500
I can escape these threads instantly

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,250
by dislocating my fingers.

50
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,490
I'll need 0.7 seconds to attack.

51
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,470
I'll have plenty of time!

52
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,830
It'll take a few seconds before

53
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,650
their eyes adjust to the dark

54
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,940
if the lights suddenly go out!

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,460
It's time for our last song.

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,250
This request comes from Kicchomu-san.

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,100
Three more minutes!

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,100
Paku and the others are here.

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,370
Oh?

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,350
What's this? You got caught again?

61
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,750
I get it...

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,730
You changed your minds and
decided to join, right?

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,090
We didn't know that the reward
for you guys was rescinded.

64
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,080
So you screwed up again while stalking us?

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,740
Didn't learn your lesson, huh?

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,720
But this must be fate at work.

67
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,120
Two more minutes.

68
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,880
Well, let's be friends.

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,110
No way.

70
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,480
We were only following you for the reward.

71
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,880
I wouldn't even want to look at your faces.

72
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,350
Smart!

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,140
Now we won't seem suspicious
when we close our eyes.

74
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,790
I agree.

75
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,780
Well, boss?

76
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,140
They've got guts, right?

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,150
Their sass reminds me of Uvo.

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,450
That's probably because they're kids.

79
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,520
They know no fear.

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
Anyway, describe the chain user for us.

81
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,770
First things first, Paku.

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,910
Check these kids again.

83
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,540
Okay, what do you want to know?

84
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,040
What are they hiding?

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,060
Damn, that's a smart question.

86
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,580
Straight to the point,

87
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,290
and he can learn all kinds
of information from it.

88
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,870
Well, there's only one minute left

89
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,460
in this week's broadcast.

90
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,810
One minute! We have to buy time!

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
It's no use.

92
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,350
Your power

93
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,890
lets you draw out memories
from those you touch, right?

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,480
We aren't hiding anything,
and we know no—

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,140
I'll know the truth soon enough.

96
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,320
Shut up.

97
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,860
Even if we did know something,

98
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,480
we could think about something else,

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,700
and hide it from you!

100
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,200
Yep, there you go.

101
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,120
You seem to be confused.

102
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,350
I draw out the purest essence of human memory.

103
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,210
I'm not browsing through
the images in your mind.

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,450
My question will stimulate your memory,

105
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,420
stirring up the dirt collected in its depths

106
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,400
like throwing a stone into a pond.

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,350
The dirt represents your pure,
unaltered memories.

108
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
And I simply scoop them up.

109
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,640
It's impossible to deceive me.

110
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,060
I'll see you next week.

111
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,890
This is JFN, and it's 7:00 PM.

112
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,490
Here it comes!

113
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,490
Now, it's time to ask my question.

114
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,840
What are you hiding?

115
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,960
I can see them!

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,390
And they can't see us!

117
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,810
The kid on the right is free?

118
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,850
I can't see!

119
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,020
This was their plan?

120
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,190
I won't let go of the other one!

121
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,650
Gon!

122
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,900
To break the thread, I'll have to kill her!

123
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,650
I can't pull out my hand...

124
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,910
She trapped it with her muscles!

125
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,290
You're mine.

126
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,440
Once you reveal your presence,
I can sense you.

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,290
Using the dark was meaningless.

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,500
Killua!

129
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,300
Give up.

130
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,580
A pity...

131
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,550
Well, it was a good shot.

132
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,770
It came from the entrance?

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,270
The guy with the radio was
working with them.

134
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Forget him!

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,930
We only need these two.

136
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,270
Our eyes will adjust shortly.

137
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,210
Yes.

138
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,780
Wait, where's the boss?

139
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,910
The boss is gone...

140
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,910
Shizuku, hold this guy for me.

141
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,500
Sure.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,490
Paku, are you okay?

143
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,750
He broke my left hand and a molar...

144
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,530
We underestimated them.

145
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,160
Anyway, this is going to shock you.

146
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,990
These kids are—

147
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,890
Wait!

148
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,390
Pakunoda, this is for you.

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,390
Discuss their memories, and I'll kill him.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,740
Hey, what's going on?

151
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,110
We missed him because he was
disguised as a receptionist!

152
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,290
And, wait... the boss should have

153
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,880
been able to evade a chain
attack from that distance.

154
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,420
But the abrupt plunge

155
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,080
into darkness delayed his reactions.

156
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,640
This was all planned out!

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,450
But I was only able to learn keywords

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,430
what are you hiding?

160
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,430
such as "blackout" and "seven o'clock."

161
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,710
And there's one more question...

162
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,850
If these kids knew the chain user all along,

163
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,130
why didn't my previous questioning
trigger any memories?

164
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,950
He must have been hiding his powers

165
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,520
from his own allies!

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,620
From all that, we can surmise
that he is most likely intelligent,

167
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,240
quick on his feet, secretive,
and level headed.

168
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,240
He probably isn't bluffing.

169
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,220
He was prepared to sacrifice a few
seconds to leave this message.

170
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,790
Which means the message must be true.

171
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,530
His ally can read human emotion

172
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,320
by listening to heartbeats.

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,230
That ally is the reason he
left this message behind.

174
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,990
If I talk, he'll sacrifice his own
allies and kill the boss.

175
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,560
But that also means that these
kids are valuable as hostages.

176
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,330
Paku.

177
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,260
We have a chance to rescue the boss.

178
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,910
Paku...

179
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,420
But...

180
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,290
Paku!

181
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,880
Don't say a word.

182
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,380
Got it?

183
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,300
Machi, focus on your threads.

184
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,630
I'll take him for you.

185
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,010
Kurapika pulled it off.

186
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,330
Since he left us a message,

187
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,720
he'll contact us again.

188
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,310
Until then, these kids are valuable hostages.

189
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,270
I am the head,

190
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,660
and you are the legs of the spider.

191
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,730
Natural law dictates that the
legs blindly follow the head.

192
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,480
However, this simply represents
a chain of command.

193
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,260
It doesn't apply to my life or death.

194
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,200
If I happen to die, one of you can replace me.

195
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,920
And there may come a time when a leg
has more importance than the head.

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,930
Make the right call.

197
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,480
My orders are top priority.

198
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,430
However, I am not your top priority.

199
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,640
Our goal is not to keep an individual alive,

200
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,000
but the spider.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,390
Never forget that.

202
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,690
What should we do in this situation?

203
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,440
If I tell everyone the chain
user's powers and weaknesses

204
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,320
that I learned, we can defeat him.

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,580
With ease.

206
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,700
But that will probably lead
to the boss' death.

207
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,450
Uvo must have faced a similar decision.

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,550
He died for the spider.

209
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,210
Died?

210
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,010
What did that fortune from the boss say?

211
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:42,220
On a dark day with very little light,
you will face two choices within a small room.
You must choose between pride and betrayal.
While the death-bringer hovers near.

212
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,680
Two choices...

213
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,520
Would it be considered betrayal to speak?

214
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,220
Or would it be considered betrayal to lie?

215
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,720
It is the spider that must be kept alive.

216
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,760
Right...

217
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm thinking too hard.

218
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,890
Paku,

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,010
don't worry about it too much.

220
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,400
Just keep your mouth shut.

221
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,360
Hurry, Phinks!

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
The boss has been captured!

223
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,290
Boss...

224
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,160
We still need you.

225
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,040
Even if it means

226
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
I must betray the spider.

227
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,260
It's okay.

228
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,370
A number of the enemies were injured.

229
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,260
They won't move until reinforcements arrive.

230
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,980
What are you looking at?

231
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,770
Nothing.

232
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,060
I didn't expect the chain user to be a woman.

233
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,020
Did I say that I was?

234
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,920
You shouldn't let appearances deceive you.

235
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,530
Anyway, you should watch what you say.

236
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,720
Since it may be the last
thing out of your mouth.

237
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,250
You won't kill me.

238
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,160
You left your precious friends behind.

239
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,710
I'm not so composed that
I will ignore your taunts!

240
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,790
Kurapika!

241
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,550
That's enough.

242
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,960
The girl's fortune didn't mention this.

243
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,270
Therefore, this event

244
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,560
isn't significant enough to matter.

245
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,100
You bastard!

246
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,350
Kurapika!

247
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,370
If you kill him, I'll kick your ass!

248
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,820
Do you need further explanation?

249
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,570
I consider this situation

250
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,740
the same as an afternoon coffee break.

251
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,870
A peaceful outing.

252
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,990
Calm down, Kurapika!

253
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,560
We're on equal footing now!

254
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,780
Nothing has changed.

255
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,680
Equal footing?

256
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,250
You are sorely mistaken.

257
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,930
First of all, you've made
the wrong assumption.

258
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,130
I have no value as a hostage.

259
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,670
If you insist on babbling...

260
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,850
He isn't lying.

261
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,350
Everything he says is true.

262
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,140
There you go.

263
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,800
This is reality.

264
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,860
You people are the ones on the ropes.

265
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,620
What do you mean?

266
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,150
His heartbeat is normal.

267
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,860
He isn't shaken by any of this.

268
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,890
He isn't worried or frightened of death.

269
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,230
I can hear that he's accepted death.

270
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,870
I can hear that he walks
with death every day.

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,510
How is he capable of producing such a sound?

272
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,930
No more!

273
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,540
I can't take any more of this!

274
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,010
I don't want to listen to you or him!

275
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,910
Melody...

276
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,060
He truly believes that he has
no value as a hostage.

277
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,520
But the fact remains that he is the leader.

278
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,270
What are you...

279
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,910
What are you people?

280
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,950
The spider.

281
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,780
Explain.

282
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,300
The lights went out.

283
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,910
The boss was taken in that instant.

284
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,490
Here's the message from the chain user.

285
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,160
Why didn't you go after him immediately?

286
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,460
Machi and Paku were injured.

287
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,350
So?

288
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,420
He has allies who are pro Hunters.

289
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,670
So?

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,010
Read between the lines!

291
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,180
It proves we can use these kids as hostages.

292
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,990
If we give chase and let
them escape, it's over!

293
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,760
The boss has probably been captured

294
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,130
by those chains that Uvo couldn't break.

295
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,400
It'll be difficult for him to escape on his own!

296
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,740
Probably?

297
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,440
The lights went out!

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,670
By the time our eyes adjusted,
the boss was gone.

299
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,450
We weren't in any condition to move.

300
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,230
Okay, we can assign blame later.

301
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,950
For now, we need a plan.

302
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,960
Five years ago, were you the
leader when the Troupe

303
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,010
slaughtered the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?

304
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,190
Answer me!

305
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,680
Are those the chains you used to kill Uvo?

306
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,860
What were Uvo's last words?

307
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,180
I don't remember.

308
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,610
You're lying.

309
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,510
Am I right, miss?

310
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,180
I can relate.

311
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,420
I feel the same way.

312
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,170
I have nothing to say to you.

313
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,690
Kurapika, he's trying to provoke you!

314
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,680
Damn...

315
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,680
Don't fall for it!

316
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,110
Damn!

317
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,700
Damn!

318
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,310
That proves it.

319
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,460
I'm quite surprised.

320
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,400
The chain user has an exploitable weakness.

321
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,130
I can use this.

322
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,230
It's the boss.

323
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,090
Hello?

324
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,950
I have three demands.

325
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,230
The chain user?

326
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,850
The general rule is that my
demands are absolute.

327
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,230
If you don't obey, I will kill
your leader immediately.

328
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,470
First, do not follow me.

329
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,990
Second, do not harm your two hostages.

330
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,270
Third, put that Pakunoda woman on the phone.

331
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,010
Can I ask you something first?

332
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,500
It's about the second demand.

333
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,140
The two hostages put up a struggle,

334
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,880
and we had to break a few bones.

335
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,800
Then we're done negotiating.

336
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,160
What is it?

337
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,780
Sorry, I was lying.

338
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,010
Both of them are unharmed.

339
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,690
This is your last chance.

340
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,470
Do not fool around.

341
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,140
Put Pakunoda on the phone.

342
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,770
Ow!

343
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,650
Hello?

344
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,540
You are the only one allowed
to hear what I say.

345
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,080
Move away from the others.

346
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
Did you make contact with
a man named Squala?

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,860
Yes.

348
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,240
Are you aware of a woman named Melody?

349
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,300
I am.

350
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,570
Then this will be quick.

351
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,110
Listen carefully.

352
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,540
You are forbidden from
communicating with your comrades.

353
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,950
No talking, gesturing, writing,
signaling, or making eye contact.

354
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,240
None of that is allowed.

355
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,450
You must come alone to
the place I designate.

356
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,940
If your heart rate changes even in
the slightest, I will kill the hostage.

357
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,060
Understood?

358
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,310
Now give the phone to someone
besides the previous man.

359
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,190
I'm here.

360
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,230
I'm going to meet with Pakunoda alone.

361
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,690
The rest of you must return to your hideout.

362
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,950
All ten Troupe members must be there.

363
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,090
If a single one is missing, I will kill the hostage.

364
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,000
Understood?

365
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,820
Yeah.

366
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,180
Put Pakunoda back on.

367
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,460
Here.

368
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
You're to come to Lingon Airport.

369
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,080
You have until 8:00.

370
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,510
And you must come alone.

371
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,390
Don't hesitate, Pakunoda.

372
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,470
Bring everyone.

373
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,470
He'll put his friends before his mission.

374
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,950
Hey, Paku!

375
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,230
Wait!

376
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,540
Let Paku go by herself.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
We're returning to the hideout.

378
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,500
Orders from the chain user.

379
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,220
What's your point?

380
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,230
If we disobey, he'll kill the boss!

381
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,490
Are you an idiot?

382
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,410
If that happens, we kill the chain user.

383
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,490
And that will be the end.

384
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,490
It's what the boss would tell us to do.

385
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,000
Nobunaga, you insult the spider.

386
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,320
We have to follow Pakunoda now.

387
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,100
This is an absolute necessity!

388
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,430
I concur.

389
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,760
There's no point in letting Paku go alone.

390
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,530
If we continue to follow his orders,

391
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,260
the fortunes will come true.

392
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,570
I agree with Nobunaga.

393
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,450
We should follow his orders for now.

394
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,270
I agree.

395
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,680
For now?

396
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,580
How long do we listen to him?

397
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,890
Until half our limbs are gone?

398
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,530
Shizuku, what do you think?

399
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,390
When there's a fight, we flip a coin.

400
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,660
He's broken the rules.

401
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,900
But I'll side with Nobunaga.

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,480
I don't want the boss to die now.

403
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,910
I don't want Paku to die, either.

404
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,420
I'm sure Paku feels the same way.

405
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,740
That's why she left without a word.

406
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,900
I don't believe this...

407
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,560
Talking to you is pointless.

408
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,370
I would love to kill you right now,

409
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,050
but following Pakunoda comes first.

410
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,300
Wait!

411
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,700
Take one more step,

412
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,310
and I'll cut you down.

413
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,570
Go ahead and try.

414
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,800
Troupe members aren't allowed to fight.

415
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,330
Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?

416
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,830
That's what my heart says.

417
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,200
But the rules are absolute.

418
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,480
If we reject the rules, we reject the spider.

419
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,520
And we also reject the boss.

420
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,460
I don't want to do that.

421
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,890
It's him.

422
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,840
I'll take it.

423
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,710
Hello—

424
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,970
Put one of the hostages on the phone.

425
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,060
You little...

426
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,890
Here.

427
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,390
Are they all together?

428
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,620
They are right now.

429
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,480
But they're talking about
going after Pakunoda...

430
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,120
Watch your mouth, kid.

431
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Hello?

432
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,240
You have thirty minutes to
return to your hideout.

433
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,740
You can try trickery if you want,
but your leader will die.

434
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll call again shortly.

435
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,850
We won't be able to follow Paku now.

436
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,820
Damn it!

437
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,630
The boss will die if we ten aren't together?

438
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,630
He's pretty smart to use the
hostages as messengers.

439
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,900
This is the perfect chance to fight the boss.

440
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,280
But if I leave, the boss will die.

441
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,140
There you have it.

442
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,420
Lend me a hand.

443
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,930
Sure.

444
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,280
I've known you a little longer than Chrollo.

445
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,170
Kurapika's revenge has come to fruition.

446
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,420
And his confrontation with the
Troupe has reached its final stage.

447
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

448
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

449
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

450
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

451
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

452
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

453
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

454
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

455
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:19,920
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

456
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,020
Today, we introduce Pakunoda.

457
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,370
A Phantom Troupe member.

458
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,280
A Specialist.

459
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,710
Her power lets her see memories

460
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,870
A Specialist.

461
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,090
by touching people and objects.

462
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,920
Her rare ability shows her
the memories of the people
or objects she touches.

463
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,180
She can conjure those memories or her own

464
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,740
into bullets to shoot.

465
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,250
Memory Bomb!

466
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,420
Next time: Signal x To x Retreat.

467
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,630
What are you doing, Killua?

468
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,260
Time to retreat.
