2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,860
The King's self-injury...

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,380
The third party...

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,730
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,870
I have a feeling...

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,730
At worst, the answer we find could
potentially ruin all of our plans.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,120
It's time!

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,790
One minute to go.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,250
Gather around.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,690
Damn! We're out of time...

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Charge x And x Invade

12
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,740
Two minutes before Morel
issued the call to attack...

13
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,120
Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over

14
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,680
the Republic of East Gorteau.

15
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,860
Pitou was the first one to notice.

16
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,500
The only reason Pitou decided to look up

17
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,680
was "just because."

18
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,960
Pitou's hunch was just that faint.

19
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,100
Something is coming.

20
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,680
However, a few seconds later,
that hunch turned to certainty.

21
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,250
The enemy.

22
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,480
But at that point, the enemy was still very high up.

23
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,770
Too high for even Pitou's
exceptional senses to ascertain.

24
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,070
Pitou's decision to prepare for battle

25
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,780
was based solely on primal instinct.

26
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,240
Pitou's En...

27
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,050
has vanished.

28
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:06,010
Two of the Royal Guard almost
simultaneously spotted the approaching form.

29
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,570
A dragon!

30
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,820
At the Same Time

31
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,090
Ten seconds to go.

32
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,320
Nine!

33
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,510
Eight!

34
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,320
Seven.

35
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,160
As Morel counted down to the attack,

36
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,540
Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank

37
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,610
to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him.

38
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,800
Six...

39
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,410
Five.

40
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,830
Four.

41
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,430
Three.

42
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,380
Two.

43
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,050
This was when Pitou ceased using En,

44
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,880
in order to prepare for the coming fight.

45
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,700
However...

46
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,780
One.

47
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,910
Go!

48
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,470
Your Majesty!

49
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,970
Dragon Meteor Shower
Dragon Dive

50
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,300
Dragon Dive.

51
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,570
The sighting of the enemy

52
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,230
and the decision to stop using En
in preparation for battle had backfired.

53
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Where are they?

54
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,980
Faced with a serious threat to the King,

55
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,040
Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits,

56
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,750
immediately focused on the intruders.

57
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,330
The countless dragons that rained
down were less significant threats

58
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,430
than the humans in the sky.

59
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,270
Terpsichora!

60
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,260
Puppet Master's Serenity
Terpsichora

61
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,270
Pitou uses this Nen ability when
full power is required to fight.

62
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,030
It takes less than a tenth of a second
after activation to launch the attack.

63
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,280
However, during that fraction of a second,
Pitou could hear Netero speaking.

64
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,290
I prepared for a variety of responses.

65
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,270
But you've made a bad move, little Ant.

66
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,620
Bad Move

67
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,250
It really happens.

68
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,870
You don't think it's possible.

69
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,690
But it is.

70
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,720
It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.

71
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,700
When you know you're about to die, you feel
as though time slows, and you review your life.

72
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,200
It's just like that.

73
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,030
In fact, I'd consider this
phenomenon even more credible.

74
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,460
Because you can hear what
the other person is thinking.

75
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,500
You can even obtain information
known only to the other person.

76
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,640
There is proof that it worked.

77
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,230
Martial artists call this "listening with the spirit."

78
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,480
Listening with the Spirit

79
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,070
It's a time perception paradox that occurs
commonly when two skilled warriors clash.

80
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,200
The secret behind the old man's strength?

81
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,440
I can think of a few possibilities.

82
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,120
First, his Nen is very quiet.

83
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,710
No one can predict his next
attack by reading his aura.

84
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,980
He's lived a long time for a reason.

85
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,010
He has a plant's mental toughness.

86
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,980
Hell, he was an old man when
I was still breast feeding.

87
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,110
He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.

88
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,550
I'd consider him an acquaintance.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,430
We are like yin and yang.

90
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,100
Fool, we aren't evenly matched.

91
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,740
He always has the upper hand.

92
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,870
What?

93
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,530
The secret behind his strength?

94
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,350
I guess there's also that...

95
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,380
When it comes to battle,

96
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,230
he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva.

97
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,740
That is his most dangerous ability.

98
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:44,800
Netero's sequential movements appeared
exceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.

99
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,410
No

100
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,410
No...

101
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,810
There was no doubt that
Netero's motions had ended

102
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,270
in the moment between Pitou's Nen
activation and subsequent attack.

103
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,650
Essentially, this required the
constriction of time perception,

104
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,760
almost to the point of stopping
time entirely for Pitou alone,

105
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,100
in order to perceive Netero's actions.

106
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,090
In other words, the result was...

107
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,560
an attack that could not be dodged.

108
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,610
Netero, forty-six years old,
in the dead of winter.

109
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,070
Sensing that he had reached his limits
of both body and technique,

110
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,760
he spent much time in contemplation

111
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,130
before he reached an answer.

112
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,540
Gratitude

113
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,910
That answer was gratitude.

114
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,230
Amen...

115
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,280
He owed a debt to the martial arts
that had helped him to mature.

116
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,730
The method he came up with to
repay that debt as best he could...

117
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,860
was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day.

118
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,790
He would calm himself,

119
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,700
worship,

120
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,990
pray,

121
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,920
ready himself,

122
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,150
then punch.

123
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,510
At first, completing the sequence
took five or six seconds.

124
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,790
On the first day, he required over 18
hours to complete 10,000 punches.

125
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,130
Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot.

126
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,300
When he awoke, he resumed
punching, day after day.

127
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,210
After two years, he noticed a difference.

128
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:46,000
After he'd completed 10,000 punches,
the sun was still up.

129
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,680
At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis.

130
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,000
He managed to complete 10,000
punches of gratitude

131
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,190
in under an hour.

132
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,090
This left him more time for prayer.

133
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,880
When Netero came down from
the mountains, his fists

134
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,970
were faster than sound.

135
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,510
Was that my imagination?

136
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,270
For a moment, he seemed to disappear...

137
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,750
I didn't hear anything until after...

138
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,430
Master?

139
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,780
La—

140
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,960
Lady Guanyin...

141
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,490
So...

142
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,540
Are you willing to defend your school?

143
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,490
I offer you my school.

144
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,130
Please accept me as a student!

145
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,590
A monster was born.

146
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,240
Sure, if you give me something to eat.

147
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,770
This happened over six decades ago.

148
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,700
Considering where his hands stopped,
the attack shouldn't come from there...

149
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,540
How?!

150
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,540
I hope that you will not return.

151
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,050
This will force me a long distance away!

152
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,300
Your Majesty!

153
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,650
Pouf!

154
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,800
He can't hear me...
He's too worried about the King.

155
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,910
Doctor Blythe!

156
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,820
By its nature, this ability could
only be used for healing.

157
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,010
Doctor Blythe cannot move from
its initial summoned position.

158
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,810
Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,

159
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,950
Pitou must stay within twenty meters.

160
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,480
That restriction

161
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,220
kept Pitou in the fight.

162
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,450
I've stopped?

163
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
Quickly...

164
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,980
Quickly!

165
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,010
Midnight

166
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:57,640
There, they encountered someone they
hadn't counted on seeing at this point.
