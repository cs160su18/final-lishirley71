2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,150
I never knew

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,260
how frustrating

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,980
weakness could be!

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,570
Gon...

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,130
For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,480
I'll protect you.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,290
I will do whatever it takes!

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
One Wish x And x Two Promises

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,700
Colt arrived, under a white flag of
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.

11
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,470
His wish was that they save the dying Queen.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,150
After hearing his request, Morel and
Knov took Colt to see Netero.

13
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,930
It's me.

14
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,420
Send over a team of Chimera Ant
researchers immediately.

15
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,760
Hmm?

16
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,660
The king has been born.

17
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,710
Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,

18
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,320
and have him bring all

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,260
his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.

20
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,200
We leave in four hours.

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,130
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,490
We will do everything we can.

23
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,370
Colt-kun...

24
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,320
We'll need your cooperation.

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,080
Heart

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,770
This may be the last time I wear this...

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,250
Hey, is that...

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,340
Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt.

29
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,510
Heart

30
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,980
They say it's a lucky shirt he only
wears when he fights for real.

31
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,180
But I always thought it was a just a rumor...

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Colt-kun, it appears that you can use Nen...

33
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,010
Since you've been in the King's presence,

34
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,950
I want you to give me your honest opinion.

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,830
How do I compare to the King?

36
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,430
He really is special...

37
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,860
It feels like needles pricking
me all over my body.

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,900
Most likely,

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,010
you will be unable to lay a finger on him.

40
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,130
You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard

41
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,820
before you can get close enough.

42
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,870
I see...

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm happy to hear that.

44
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,000
At this age, I'll be a challenger.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,580
This is exciting stuff.

46
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,350
Morel, I believe your disciples
were to fight today, yes?

47
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,720
Yes.

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,100
Take the victors and the research team,

49
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,800
along with Colt, to the nest.

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,220
And you, Chairman?

51
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,460
You don't plan to pursue the King alone?

52
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,550
Oh, no...

53
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,290
I'm off to see an old acquaintance.

54
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,570
Don't forget to pay me my one million.

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,630
I know.

56
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,800
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,110
Nothing important.

58
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,660
Let's go.

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,680
Yeah.

60
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,590
Everyone else has left.

61
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,720
Most of our soldiers joined
other squadrons and left.

62
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,600
Though a few oddballs did leave
their squadrons to stay here.

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,140
I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.

64
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,070
Did you stop the bleeding?

65
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,360
Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.

66
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,620
I'm not sure we can, either.
Don't expect too much.

67
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,870
For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,470
Can you use my organs?

69
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,630
You can have all my blood, as well!

70
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,920
Unfortunately, it won't work.

71
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,630
Chimera Ants from different generations
are completely different organisms.

72
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,640
Just look at how much the Chimera
Ants in your own generation vary.

73
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,140
But the sentiment is appreciated.

74
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,400
We'll do our best, so pray...

75
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,060
That, miraculously, all the organs will function.

76
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,200
Pray...

77
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,040
Is that all I can do?

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,440
Someone...

79
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,060
Is anyone there?

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,060
Yes, I am by your side!

81
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,070
Please give me your command!

82
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,020
What is it?

83
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,690
Telepathy?

84
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,580
Yes,

85
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,430
the Queen cannot speak as we do.

86
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,840
Can you tell us what she's saying?

87
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,590
Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.

88
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,620
My son...

89
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,090
Is my son all right?

90
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,400
Did he have any defects?

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,780
...defects?

92
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,670
You have nothing to worry about.

93
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,610
He is perfectly healthy, and right now...

94
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,530
And right now, he's taken
the Royal Guard to search

95
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,810
for medicine to help you.

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,510
...to help you.

97
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,390
The truth is that, after he killed
and ate Squadron Leaders,

98
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,130
he left in search of a new territory.

99
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,730
I doubt he will return.

100
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,050
He ate them?

101
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,880
The King

102
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,000
has no concern for the Queen's health!

103
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,680
Then, the King is safe?

104
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
Yes.

105
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,950
That is wonderful...

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,650
Oh, no.

107
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,340
Send the King off at once.

108
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,870
There is no time to waste on my well-being...

109
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,170
My son has the potential to rule the world.

110
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,810
He was born too early,

111
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,460
so I was very worried.

112
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,900
However, it appears...

113
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,040
I have fulfilled my duty...

114
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,530
That was all I wanted.

115
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,160
What are you saying?!

116
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,590
You are our guiding light...

117
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,990
Without you, the rest of us will
lose our way and perish.

118
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,740
I know my body better than anyone else...

119
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,020
I will not last much longer.

120
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,540
However, I have

121
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,760
no regrets.

122
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,190
Please stop!

123
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,200
I beg you... Please live!

124
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,120
Use my body! Please!

125
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,590
Give it a shot!

126
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,700
Until you try, you don't know it won't work!

127
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,810
Listen...

128
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,710
You must listen to what the Queen has to say.

129
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,570
I have one last request...

130
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,410
I thought of a name...

131
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,980
for my son.

132
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,200
For the King...

133
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,550
A name?

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,930
Meruem.

135
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,930
It means the light that illuminates all.

136
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,840
Deliver my message to him...

137
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,180
My beloved son...

138
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,380
I failed to protect her again...

139
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,360
I can't protect anyone...

140
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
Has something like this happened before?

141
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,350
No, he's probably referring to a memory

142
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,810
from when he was human.

143
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,160
You have memories from
when you were human?

144
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,310
Of course, though naturally, some
remember more than others...

145
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,670
Our human personalities

146
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,160
strongly influence our current behavior.

147
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,070
And many can remember their human names.

148
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,510
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been
as easy to learn to speak.

149
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,990
Hmm?

150
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,850
Th-This is...

151
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,020
There's...

152
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,180
There's something moving!

153
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,470
Don't touch it!

154
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,180
I will...

155
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,260
I will remove it.

156
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,980
I shall protect this child...

157
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,430
I swear it!

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,470
This time, I won't fail...

159
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,720
Morel?

160
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,020
Colt...

161
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,330
Can you promise me

162
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,260
that you and that child
will never eat humans?

163
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,650
If you can't make that promise,

164
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,950
you should get out of my sight immediately.

165
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,850
But if you're willing to give your word...

166
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,330
No one will ever lay a finger on you,

167
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,110
not as long as I'm around.

168
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,500
You have my promise!

169
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,620
It isn't a big deal...

170
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,140
I inherited my soft nature from my master.

171
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,310
Okay, I've recovered!

172
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,250
Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.

173
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,570
So I have to become stronger!

174
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,820
So that Kite won't be disappointed
when he comes back.

175
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,330
Ah, so you do understand.

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,010
You may have met Kite before we did,

177
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,560
but we've spent more time with him.

178
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,340
After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still
been moping, I would've given you a beating...

179
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,820
And told you that Kite wouldn't
want to see you two like this.

180
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,240
I know he's still alive,

181
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,860
and he doesn't want you to have regrets.

182
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,000
Right now, what should you do?

183
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,520
You must make the correct decision,
and find the will to follow through!

184
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,850
If you're too weak, train more.

185
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,120
There's enough space here
for squats and push-ups.

186
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,070
Yeah, you're right.

187
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,020
Hey, Spin...

188
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,380
Hmm?

189
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,430
Why do you want to be a Hunter?

190
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,260
I need the money to repay a huge debt.

191
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,340
Have you heard of the small-billed swan?

192
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,270
Nope...

193
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,550
It's a species of bird that can only live
in the area around a certain mine.

194
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,420
No one knows why that is.

195
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,280
Is it the water? The food? The weather?

196
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,090
So I bought the entire area where the mine is.

197
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,690
Well, the mine's closed down now.

198
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,870
Kite provided the money for that.

199
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,570
He was the first adult who was willing to listen

200
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,920
to kids who had nothing at all.

201
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,620
Stinn and I were born in that area.

202
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,720
The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking
flight with the light of dawn at their backs...

203
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,990
That's the oldest, but strongest,
memory Stinn and I have.

204
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,520
When we heard the area would be demolished,

205
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,060
we realized how important it was to us...

206
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,850
Kite said that he envied us.

207
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,140
He doesn't have a home.

208
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,860
Because he doesn't know where he was born.

209
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,370
Once this mission is over,
I can show you two

210
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,470
my treasure.

211
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,760
Th-This is...

212
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,240
Goal!

213
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,540
I am the Speed King.

214
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,250
No one can stop me!

215
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,490
Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably
already crossed the border.

216
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, I'll take my time searching...

217
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,560
For my own paradise,
with plenty of food and females.

218
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,260
Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...

219
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.

220
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,770
Because I am the Glutton King.

221
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,390
The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers

222
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,760
have now departed to become kings.

223
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,230
Meanwhile, the King

224
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,140
is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.

225
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,830
Next time: Date x With x Palm.

226
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,070
A date! A date!

227
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,370
Gon, do you understand what a date is?

228
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,400
Huh? Sure.

229
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,960
It's when a man and woman—

230
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,450
Th-Th-That's enough!
