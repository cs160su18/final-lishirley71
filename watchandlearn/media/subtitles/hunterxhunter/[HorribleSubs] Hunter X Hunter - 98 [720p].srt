00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,900
To become kings, the Chimera Ants
have spread across the world,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,280
committing acts of utmost
tyranny wherever they go.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,040
Fearing the damage will spread,

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,370
the government asks the Hunter
Association to exterminate them.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,250
Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move.

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,190
Ah, is that all?

8
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,970
Infiltration x And x Selection

9
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,940
Sneaking in was easy.

10
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,710
But the question is how to get
close enough to the enemy.

11
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,390
And we can't let just anyone see us, either.

12
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,900
Informants

13
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,260
This country has a powerful
information regulation system that

14
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,900
operates in secret using groups of informants.

15
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,170
Informants?

16
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,910
Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy,
you receive a reward.

17
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,830
If you find evidence of insurgency,
you receive a reward.

18
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,170
If you stop someone from fleeing the
country, you receive a reward.

19
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,910
So the people will do anything for that reward.

20
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,090
And they aren't just after money.

21
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,710
After racking up enough informant points,
the entire group is promoted.

22
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,650
But if someone provides false information
or a member commits a crime,

23
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,140
the entire group is punished.

24
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
Carrot and stick, huh?

25
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,920
It's pretty nasty business.

26
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,440
Family members are put in different groups.

27
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,440
So if an entire group tries to escape,

28
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,140
the other family members can be
executed or imprisoned for life.

29
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,830
If a family is caught trying to escape together,
they'll be executed, no questions asked.

30
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,170
For this country's elite to live the good life,

31
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,330
the rest of its citizens must scrape by.

32
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,530
But the media also spreads lies.
Such as that, in other countries,

33
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,600
half the population starves by age ten.

34
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,550
Foreign aid never reaches the needy.

35
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,600
Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles.

36
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,220
It's even said that East Gorteau spends
grant money developing nuclear weapons

37
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,050
that become bargaining chips in negotiations
for unprecedented foreign aid increases.

38
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,360
Hey, don't overheat!

39
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,250
I th-think I'm okay...

40
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,510
That was just so complicated...

41
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,980
But you sure know a lot about it.

42
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,510
My brother told me everything.

43
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,370
And he probably heard it from Grandpa.

44
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,720
Your grandpa?

45
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,760
Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated
the country for a job.

46
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,240
And I've seen similar information
on Hunter websites.

47
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,170
The system is likely still in use.

48
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,500
There's a village.

49
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,470
Yeah... It's not very big.

50
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,300
What do we do?

51
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,580
Sneak in.

52
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,990
Is that a good idea?

53
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,410
We need current information.

54
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,920
Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or
how to identify someone's rank will help.

55
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,920
They may have certain practices to root out spies.

56
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,130
The more data we have, the better.

57
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,160
Wait here.

58
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,860
It's completely deserted...

59
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,970
Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?

60
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,470
No, something happened here.

61
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,970
And someone's trying to hide it.

62
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,880
Huh?

63
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,730
They did a sloppy job.

64
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,510
They didn't dig deep enough,
so wild dogs got to the bodies.

65
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,760
I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.

66
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,630
What's going on?

67
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,890
This is the true purpose of
the national celebration.

68
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:20,770
It's a pretense for entire populations of towns
and cities to vanish without raising suspicion.

69
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,330
The selection has already begun.

70
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,770
In hindsight,

71
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,500
it would be tough to summon all citizens to
the capital and make the selection so quickly.

72
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,760
This nation has a population
of around five million.

73
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,970
Clearing out one town or city
at a time is more effective.

74
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,930
In that case, their only concern would
be coworkers or family members

75
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,330
raising a fuss over the missing.

76
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,480
But with the pretext of the national celebration,

77
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,270
no one will find it strange that
they can't contact someone.

78
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,750
In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,

79
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,920
so if they believe the other party is traveling,
it makes sense that they can't contact them.

80
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,020
The selection will go very smoothly.

81
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,090
The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner.

82
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,820
They only need to attack the farthest
towns first and work their way east.

83
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,580
If each town is told that the government
will assign its people a time to depart,

84
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,030
there won't be any problems regarding
communication between towns.

85
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,210
So, by preventing people from meeting
between towns to travel together,

86
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,490
they eliminate any cause for commotion.

87
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,470
But...

88
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,240
Hmm?

89
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,500
That means

90
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,370
they have to run around the nation
to attack all five million citizens.

91
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,100
Yeah.

92
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,610
If one percent survives, that gives
them fifty thousand soldiers.

93
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,580
No, I mean before that.

94
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,870
There are ten... No, nine days left.

95
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,100
If you wanted to check five
million people in that time,

96
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,120
you'd need a lot of help.

97
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,960
Assuming that one Nen user

98
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,510
can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,630
Five hundred Nen users.

100
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,130
Exactly!

101
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,980
You're getting at the fact that there can't
be that many Ants who can use Nen?

102
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,760
Yeah.

103
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,300
I agree, but it probably isn't that hard.

104
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,100
They don't need Nen users to check everyone.

105
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,770
Huh? Why not?

106
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,770
They can use manipulation.

107
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,040
The power that Chimera Ant used...

108
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,990
I'm guessing it can be used
to automate victims or,

109
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,750
like Genthru's power, can probably be
used to control multiple people at once.

110
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,520
Ordinary humans have aura as well,

111
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,800
so the manipulator could force a
victim's aura to concentrate in his fist.

112
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,710
One punch alone could create
an army of fifty thousand.

113
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,370
While leaving four million, nine hundred
and fifty thousand dead in the process.

114
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,420
Well, it isn't all bad news.

115
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,330
If my theory is correct,

116
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,330
causing a commotion to stop their
selection will be simple.

117
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,480
We merely have to pop up,

118
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,100
take out whoever is being controlled,
and cause a panic.

119
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,160
Then we just encourage

120
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,550
the people who escape to
check on other towns nearby.

121
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,350
If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled
puppets, rather than actual Nen users,

122
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,290
taking them down will be a cinch.

123
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,390
We'll just run around, taking them down
one after another, and wreak havoc.

124
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,740
Yeah.

125
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,220
The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.

126
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,380
Once we make our move,
they'll know we're here.

127
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,230
If we want to go with the old man's
plan, we should stay hidden.

128
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,500
What do you think?

129
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,390
Let's do it.

130
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,250
If the selection has already begun,

131
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,640
we can't just stand around watching.

132
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,650
Okay, let's do it.

133
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,660
Uh-huh!

134
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,670
But I'll do this alone.

135
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,510
Huh?

136
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,950
You stay in hiding.

137
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,930
Why?

138
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,280
It'll go better if we both—

139
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,530
Don't forget our main mission!

140
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,280
Defeating that Chimera Ant.

141
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,220
That should be your focus.

142
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,920
Let me handle everything else.

143
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,470
I'll stir things up.

144
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,960
And no offense, but I work more easily alone.

145
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Jeez... Fine, I got it.

146
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,640
Really?

147
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,030
Huh?

148
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,060
Do you really understand?

149
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,790
Killua?

150
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,940
Promise me you won't make a move!

151
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,220
Not even if people are killed
right before your eyes!

152
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,950
Promise!

153
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,220
I'll contact you by text.

154
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,470
Our cell phones should still work in this area.

155
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,350
Killua?

156
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,360
Sorry... It's nothing!

157
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,190
I'm just a little tense.

158
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,860
What's this?

159
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,870
They aren't citizens of this country.

160
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,520
I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,280
But they're definitely strong...

162
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,870
Are they assassins?

163
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,880
Are they here to hunt down the King?

164
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,730
Then I can't ignore them...

165
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,890
But I don't want to fight them both at once.

166
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,430
I definitely don't want to fight the
silver-haired one on the left.

167
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,350
Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong.

168
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,030
As much potential as a Squadron Leader?

169
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,900
That kid is something special.

170
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,780
I completely concealed my presence,
but he still sensed something?

171
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,810
How convenient!

172
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,560
Are you sure about this?

173
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,570
You'll really transport my family
and me to another country?

174
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,960
Do not worry.

175
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,330
We have received official approval,
and prepared the necessary documents.

176
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,330
All that's left is for you to sign the papers.

177
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,820
However, the condition that you share
your complete knowledge of military affairs

178
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,980
in exchange for your freedom is essential.

179
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,350
As mentioned in the agreement,

180
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,590
if you do not keep up your end after signing,

181
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,600
we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions.

182
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,630
That won't be a problem.

183
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,750
I'll tell you everything...

184
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,880
All I know about the atrocities
that Diego has committed.

185
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,230
We appreciate it.

186
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,370
Our lives are on the line, as well.

187
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,810
"That Diego has committed"?

188
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,370
You talk like it doesn't concern you.

189
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,140
The wine you're drinking and
the room you stand in

190
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,450
were earned by following that bastard.

191
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,310
You mean "that we've committed,"
you son of a bitch.

192
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,590
But I get it... We're here on business.

193
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,390
So, Marcos-san...

194
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,980
Continue going about your business as normal.

195
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,390
In two weeks, you and your family
will be relaxing on the beach.

196
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,530
I can't accept it!

197
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,870
We're supposed to stand around,
watching as people are killed?

198
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,190
Are you sleepy?

199
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,220
Want me to put you to sleep, eh?

200
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,050
Calm yourself.

201
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,990
If they're gonna check five
million citizens in ten days,

202
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,300
simple arithmetic says that's
five hundred thousand per day!

203
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,140
Of which one percent will survive!

204
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,060
And your point is?

205
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,580
That means four hundred, ninety-five
thousand have already been killed!

206
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,690
How can you be so calm?

207
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,570
Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!

208
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,210
If the plan fails, everyone dies.

209
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,210
If we can't draw the three Royal
Guards away from the King,

210
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,830
not even the Chairman will
be able to defeat the King.

211
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,340
Thus, we cannot let them discover
our existence before the time is right.

212
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,490
If that happens, security around the
King will be even further tightened.

213
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,350
You must endure this.

214
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,100
You're telling me to sacrifice five
million to save the human race?

215
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,850
That's right.

216
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,780
If blaming me consoles you, go ahead.

217
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,570
But if you don't have a better idea,
don't be too self-righteous.

218
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,990
Damn it...

219
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,500
We must do only what we can.

220
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,500
But we must put our lives on the line to do so.

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,190
Yeah...

222
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,810
Is Killua okay?

223
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,100
He was acting a little weird.

224
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,880
Maybe I should have stuck with him?

225
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,820
But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad.

226
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,600
You did well to avoid that.

227
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,660
How about this?

228
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,850
I use my strong tail as a spring,
to propel me among the trees!

229
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,550
In the darkness, following my
movement is impossible!

230
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,760
Caught you!

231
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,670
Now I'm going to crush you!

232
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,670
You're not crushing me!

233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,860
Huh?

234
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,330
I'm the one who caught you!

235
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,670
He seems to have a snake's genes,

236
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,120
so he should be able to go ten
days without starving to death.

237
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,090
As I thought... He's strong...

238
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,050
But I should continue to observe.

239
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I already let them find me...

240
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,140
I need to hide better.

241
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,240
But it's strange...

242
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,990
Why are there soldiers around if the
selection is already finished here?

243
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,540
Maybe there are extra guards
because we're near the border.

244
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,150
An owl and a bat?

245
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,580
This time, he's facing two...

246
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,940
What will he do?

247
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,450
The Chimera Ants are using
darkness to attack Gon.

248
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,860
And why is Meleoron following him?

249
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,340
Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.

250
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,860
Come on down, everyone...

251
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,840
I have a perfectly ordinary box,
which has not been touched.

252
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,090
One, two, three!

253
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,220
That would be an illusion.
