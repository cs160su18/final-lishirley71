00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,500
Leol has chased Morel into
an underground church,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,720
where they will now fight one another.

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,500
This ability only activates when it rains.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,070
Inamura!

6
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,980
Return x And x Retire

7
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,860
My Inamura

8
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,870
summons waves!

9
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,030
Well? Aren't my big waves rad?

10
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,750
I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,930
You're having trouble moving
in the water, right?

12
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,380
You like how easily my board can maneuver?

13
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,190
If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death.

14
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,440
That's not your ability.

15
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,120
It belongs

16
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,070
to my buddy!

17
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,710
Oh, making a boat of smoke?

18
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,380
So he can stand on that smoke?

19
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,550
You think that's enough to defeat my waves?

20
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,190
I told you, that's not your ability!

21
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,060
This one is my own original...

22
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,160
Tornave!

23
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,220
Maelstrom!!
Tornave

24
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,720
The current's so strong...

25
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,890
I can't tell up from down.

26
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,290
This is bad.

27
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,570
I can't control my body at all...

28
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,730
I stop my opponent's
movements with a whirlpool.

29
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,230
Here I go!

30
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,730
Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!

31
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,760
My harpoon can match the speed of sound,

32
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,060
and pierce a whale at the very bottom
of the ocean, even from the sky!

33
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,470
Take this!

34
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,920
He disappeared?

35
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,730
Impossible!

36
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,400
The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.

37
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,380
He had no way to escape.

38
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,690
Bastard...

39
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,690
How did you do it?

40
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,690
I simply exhaled.

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,150
When it comes to lung capacity,
no one in the world beats me.

42
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,700
He used his breath as jet propulsion
to break out of the whirlpool?

43
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,460
Okay, it's my turn now!

44
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,440
It's your turn?

45
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,330
In this battle, you don't get a turn!

46
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,090
All you get to do is drown in my waves!

47
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,090
During this exchange, I've learned three things.

48
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,320
First, I now know your power.

49
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,740
Somehow, you're able to use
other people's abilities.

50
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,980
And those earphones

51
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,850
have nothing to do with your power.

52
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,210
They're either for show or for luck.

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,210
Or it means someone is sending you orders.

54
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,950
If he meant to impair his hearing
to strengthen his power,

55
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,050
he shouldn't be able to hear me talk.

56
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
What's the third thing?

57
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,000
Your lifespan.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,760
That Inamura ability belongs
to a Hunter named Grachan.

59
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,870
You probably encountered and defeated
him when he was sent

60
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,250
to fight the Chimera Ants.

61
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,530
I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!

62
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,280
Your life ends today!

63
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,340
Hold on...

64
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,540
That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.

65
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,450
I was protecting myself from humans
who were hunting me down.

66
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,790
It was self-defense.

67
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,780
And I didn't steal his ability.

68
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,550
I'm just borrowing it for a bit.

69
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,020
Just borrowing it for a bit?

70
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,280
That's an excuse thieves use.

71
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,310
Well, arguing with you is pointless.

72
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,430
I'd like to get my hands on his ability,

73
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,070
but defeating him is more important.

74
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,860
Right now, our top priority
is to defeat one another.

75
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,830
I'll repeat myself...

76
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!

77
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,340
Big Wall!

78
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,710
Giant Wave
Big Wall

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,150
I'm flooding this underground church.

80
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,680
My wall of water's gonna suck you in!

81
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,180
Just try and find your way to the surface!

82
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,280
Now, will he make it up?

83
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,930
Will I smash his skull with my board?

84
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,010
Launch my harpoon through his gut?

85
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,360
Which do I choose?

86
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,500
Either way,

87
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,780
if he shows his face above water, he's done.

88
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,330
He isn't coming back up...

89
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,190
Has he drowned?

90
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,010
No,

91
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,690
he was confident about his lung capacity.

92
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,340
That means he can survive for
ten or twenty minutes.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,540
No, wait.

94
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,880
It's just possible

95
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,150
that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!

96
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,650
There you are!

97
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,950
Don't move!

98
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,170
I'll impale you with my harpoon.

99
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,090
Bubbles on the opposite side, too?

100
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,490
And over here!

101
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,920
And over there!

102
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,830
There are air bubbles everywhere...

103
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,430
I see...

104
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,060
It's possible, if he formed his smoke
into a hose with multiple branches.

105
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,940
That way, he wouldn't give away his position.

106
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,460
Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?

107
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,200
Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?

108
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,760
No, that isn't it!

109
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,890
The bubbles are camouflage!

110
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,580
Is he running?

111
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,480
If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible

112
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,710
he could swim out through the maze of
underground corridors leading down here.

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,470
I can't let him escape!

114
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this,
so I could take all the credit...

115
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,410
My head's spinning?

116
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,880
And my chest hurts...

117
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,730
Have I been poisoned?

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,280
My board disappeared?

119
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,270
Is it because my physical and
mental stability are compromised?

120
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,920
Can't move...

121
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,410
Can't breathe...

122
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,220
My power stopped working,
but the water hasn't gone away?

123
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,930
Because we're underground?

124
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,090
Crap...

125
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,240
I let him think he had the advantage
so I could turn the tables on him.

126
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,270
But it looks as though the one
who was backed into a corner...

127
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,800
was me...

128
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,610
Am I gonna die?

129
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,750
Am I... Am I gonna die here?

130
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,510
So he was using smoke hoses

131
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,180
to send air bubbles everywhere.

132
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,290
But what kind of...

133
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,490
poison did he use?

134
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,020
That was faster than I expected.

135
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,950
The poison you've inhaled is lethal.

136
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,530
But it's something naturally found in air.

137
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,330
Carbon dioxide.

138
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,270
Carbon Dioxide

139
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,830
Morel used his immense lung capacity

140
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,330
to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,

141
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,330
and exhaled it with an increased
concentration of carbon dioxide.

142
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,710
I started my attack

143
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,920
before you ever began.

144
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,530
If he was telling the truth,

145
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,850
Grachan should be getting his ability back.

146
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,360
I have a few hours in which to move around.

147
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,590
During that time, I must see
them with my own eyes!

148
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,640
I've observed Bizeff's movements
with my crystal ball.

149
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,470
I know how to leave this area.

150
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,040
Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,

151
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,450
he can't tell anyone because
he's kept this area a secret.

152
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,250
They are...

153
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,400
up above.

154
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,450
I can't go any farther.

155
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,560
But...

156
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh? How are you feeling?

157
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,680
Octopus! Where am I?

158
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,180
How long was I out?

159
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,610
Don't call me an octopus!

160
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,930
This is an underground clinic for folks
with roots in the underworld.

161
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,670
You were out for two whole days.

162
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,000
Two days?! I need to get going!

163
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,630
Hey!

164
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,380
You shouldn't move around!

165
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,880
Your wounds will reopen.

166
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,290
I have to follow through with the plan...

167
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,880
Fool!

168
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,230
You were just on the verge of death!

169
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,840
You need a few days before—

170
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,890
Oh, you're awake?

171
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,520
That's great.

172
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,420
Thanks for everything you've done.

173
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm checking out now.

174
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,030
Not until you pay me.

175
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,530
Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.

176
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,780
If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead.

177
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,910
I don't have my wallet on me.
I'll wire it to you when I get back.

178
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm not stupid enough to trust
that you'll keep that promise.

179
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,460
Until you find someone to bring
the money, you're staying here.

180
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,880
I don't have time for that!

181
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,130
Give me a phone!

182
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,230
It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute.

183
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,870
Would you just shut up and go away?

184
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,990
Hello?

185
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,050
Hey, it's me.

186
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,690
Killua!

187
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,090
Where are you? Are you okay?

188
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,310
What happened?

189
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,320
I'll explain when I see you.

190
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,310
A strong enemy gave me some trouble.

191
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,900
I've been in the hospital.

192
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,540
Oh...

193
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,950
Well, I'm glad you called.

194
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,250
This means you're okay now, right?

195
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,580
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

196
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,960
Anything happen on your side?

197
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,430
We've found a strong ally.

198
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,960
He's bonding with Knuckle.

199
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,960
We have a plan that could
defeat the King if it goes well.

200
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,460
Oh...

201
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,970
We should meet, so I can hear what you think.

202
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,450
Okay.

203
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,420
Then, I need you to send money
to a certain bank account.

204
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,380
If you do that, we can rendezvous today.

205
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
That just leaves Palm.

206
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,700
You haven't been able to reach her?

207
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,330
No.

208
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,110
She's probably still in the palace...

209
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,120
But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's
Nen has already exposed her?

210
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,380
I imagine she's in the warehouse,
beneath the palace.

211
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,550
There are about five kilometers
of corridors surrounding it.

212
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,530
Pitou's En can't reach that far.

213
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,820
But since the exit is in the
palace, she can't get out.

214
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,080
How's Knov-san doing?

215
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,640
Well...

216
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,340
he's probably out of this fight.

217
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,650
But he did manage to place the exits.

218
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,500
There's no change to our plan.

219
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
Three days to go...

220
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,400
His wounds are already healed!

221
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,430
No problem.

222
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,970
Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money.

223
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,960
You can leave. Right now.

224
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,700
What are you doing?

225
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,260
Let's go.

226
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,010
Huh?

227
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,700
We're gonna join my buddies.

228
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,560
I'll introduce you.

229
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,910
But...

230
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,640
Well, I won't force you.

231
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,600
I'll just tell you this.

232
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,580
Thank you.

233
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,240
Uh, wait...

234
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,740
Actually...

235
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,230
It's okay if I come?

236
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,630
I mean, I'm just a...

237
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,380
What?

238
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,240
Was I the only one who thought
we were already friends?

239
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,220
It's really...

240
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,250
okay?

241
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,760
It isn't about what's okay.

242
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,410
It's whether you're coming or not.

243
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm going! I'm going with you!

244
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,390
I want to make something clear.

245
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,480
The next time something like this happens,

246
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,520
I won't bother thanking you.

247
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,170
So if something happens,
and I end up helping you,

248
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,760
you don't need to thank me.

249
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,530
Friends are supposed to help friends.

250
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,140
From now on, we'll be working together.

251
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,110
So we'll be helping each other.

252
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,790
Supporting each other isn't a big deal.

253
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,240
It'd be lame to thank each other
for every little thing.

254
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,770
Yeah, this is it.

255
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,900
This is the world I wanted.

256
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,230
The world I longed for and sought...

257
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,160
But deep down, I thought
it was beyond my reach...

258
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,500
That it wasn't meant for me...
And wouldn't happen...

259
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,940
I'd given up on this world.

260
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,520
I thought it wasn't meant to be...

261
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,240
Killua, I'm...

262
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm so happy, I could die!

263
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,790
Huh? Why are you crying?

264
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,690
Because...

265
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,390
Because you're doing this for me!

266
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,910
Come on...

267
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,680
I want to make one more thing clear.

268
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,550
The world you're stepping into is far more brutal

269
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,430
than the world of the Chimera Ants.

270
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,930
They may seem similar,

271
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,860
but there's a huge difference between
risking a life and throwing it away.

272
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,020
People staring death in the face every day

273
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,410
don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.

274
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,860
Only people who maintain a daily
regimen to stay in tip-top shape,

275
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,410
and can swallow just enough poison to
fall short of a lethal dose, get to survive.

276
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,960
That's how it goes.

277
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,310
Are you ready to join us?

278
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,160
How could you know

279
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,110
the words I most wanted to hear?

280
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,800
A foolish question.

281
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,480
I see paradise before me.

282
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,490
I'm going, no matter what it costs me.

283
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,420
I've seen the other side...

284
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,800
I've made contact.

285
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,670
I've learned it really exists...

286
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,050
And I can reach it!

287
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,530
Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.

288
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,150
2-1-3, marshal.

289
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,610
4-5-1, knight.

290
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,390
8-7-uh...

291
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,100
lieutenant general!

292
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,230
4-3-3... 2?

293
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,020
My phone number!
