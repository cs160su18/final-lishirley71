2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,820
I have a duty to fulfill...

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,190
I must give birth to the King!

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,990
I am the Queen!

5
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,030
Unease x And x Sighting

6
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,830
After using Accompany,

7
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,040
Gon and Killua were transported
to Ging's student, Kite.

8
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,450
After Gon remembered having
met Kite years before,

9
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,120
he felt that Ging intended
for this meeting to occur,

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,410
and his interest in Kite grew.

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,190
Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?

12
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,810
Biological surveying.

13
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,810
I focus on discovering and
researching new species.

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,360
Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?

15
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,820
Camp Tiger?

16
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,950
They can use fire.

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,320
They use branches that have been
ignited by lightning as live kindle.

18
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,670
Other than certain Magical
Beasts that walk on two legs,

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,150
they're the first of their kind:

20
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,830
animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw.

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,470
Wow, they're really cooking it.

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,110
They really are using fire!

23
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,120
Hey, what else is there?

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
Oh, yeah...

25
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,680
You said the thing that attacked
me was a Chimera Ant?

26
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,710
Yes, a Chimera Ant.

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,720
Under a class-1 quarantine.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,910
Normally, no one would be allowed
near such a dangerous insect.

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,360
Did you discover them?

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
No, I specialize in larger creatures.

31
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,360
But currently, I'm investigating these insects.

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,610
Something has been bothering me...

33
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,620
But it appears that now, I'll have
to move to a different location.

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,630
I must make a call, but I'm not
getting any reception here.

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,060
A call?

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,230
I'm working with others.

37
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,130
Seven of us are working as a team.

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,220
I guess I must wait for their arrival.

39
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,410
Once they're here, I'll introduce you.

40
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,390
They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh?

42
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,750
Ah, speak of the devil.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,690
Kite, who are these kids?

44
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,100
My friends.

45
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,410
They dropped by for a visit on their travels.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,870
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet
you all the way out here.

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,790
I'm Spinner Clow.

48
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,230
Call me Spin!

49
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,200
Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,210
I'm Gon Freecss.

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,800
Nice to meet you, Spin.

52
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,710
Freecss...

53
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,610
Wait, is this...

54
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,640
Yes, Ging-san's son.

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,010
Really?!

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,390
And you? Not you, too?

57
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,500
No, not me.

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,150
My name is Killua Zoldyck.

59
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,510
Zoldyck...

60
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,650
Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you
part of the famous family of assassins?

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah, but I quit.

62
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,280
Additionally, they are both pro Hunters.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,660
So you should show some respect.

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,770
Wow!

65
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,670
Man, that was a shock!

66
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,960
We've been conducting biological
surveys with Kite for three years,

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,330
but this is the most incredible
organism we've ever seen!

68
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,180
Yeah, no kidding...

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,770
I don't think we finished our introductions.

70
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,120
I'm Monta Yuras.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,430
But call me Mon.

72
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,190
Nice to meet you, Mon.

73
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm Stick Dinner.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,820
I handle the cooking.

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,710
Know why?

76
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,390
Because my name is Dinner.

77
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,070
Nice meeting you.

78
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,980
My name is Banana Kavaro.

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,270
Good to meet you.

80
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,740
We have two others on our team.

81
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,330
Where are Podungo and Lin?

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,590
They're both headed toward
the area of the sighting.

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,880
They always move so fast.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,220
Oh, and you were right, Kite...

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,160
This looks just like the claw
of a Chimera Ant queen.

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,980
We ran some computer analyses,
and the result was a 99% match.

87
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,370
Can I see it?

88
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,280
Sure.

89
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,120
This is a Chimera Ant claw?

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,850
It's as big as a human finger.

91
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,240
Does that mean there are huge ants?

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,990
We don't know.

93
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,220
Maybe one mutated and grew really big?

94
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,710
That's possible, though it may also belong
to a completely different species.

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,380
Regardless, we just don't know right now.

96
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,980
That's why we're investigating.

97
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,330
It all started with the wonkiest little thing...

98
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,260
His name was Won!

99
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,050
He was a Kakin official.

100
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,380
What's Kakin?

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,370
Right here.

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,420
It's this wild land, in the middle
of the Azian continent.

103
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,310
We had just completed a biological
survey they had requested when...

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,030
Magnificent.

105
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,600
You've completed two hundred years'
worth of work for this agency...

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,690
To be honest, I regret that I am
unable to pay you a bonus.

107
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,370
Don't say that, Won-san.

108
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,920
We enjoyed ourselves.

109
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,830
In lieu of that,

110
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,430
I'll be sure to recommend you
to other friendly nations.

111
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
We appreciate it.

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,450
Oh, that's right!

113
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,330
I'm going to ramble a bit.

114
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,440
I believe part of a very strange species was
brought to the Southern Piece auction...

115
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,350
There's suspicion that it's from
an unidentified organism,

116
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,430
so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,

117
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,450
but since they'd have to donate it
to a government agency otherwise,

118
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,530
they hoped a licensed Hunter would
buy it from them for a high price.

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,170
Here you are.

120
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,660
Well, Lin?

121
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,100
Th-This clearly belongs to an
unidentified organism, yes.

122
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,600
F-From what I can see,
it resembles an insect's leg...

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,090
B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.

124
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,930
And the claw exhibits traits
not found among insects...

125
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,310
A leg typically has two claws, but this has six.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,370
It almost looks as though the tarsi
evolved into something like fingers?

127
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,880
Yes, and this part is spiny,
so it could be the tibia.

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,420
If we take a sample and study
it further, we'll learn more.

129
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,820
Could you give us a small part?

130
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,920
Since Won-san referred you
to us, we cannot refuse.

131
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,090
Let's look into this, then.

132
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,770
We'll send you any results, once we have them.

133
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,960
Appreciated.

134
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,080
Chimera Ant...

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,790
Where did Lin and Podungo go?

136
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,630
Somewhere south of Yorknew City.

137
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,410
The person who found the insect leg
apparently lives in a city by the ocean.

138
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,800
Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath,
but we should hurry after them.

139
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,830
Hey, can we come with you?

140
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,780
Hmm?

141
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,860
Sure.

142
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,060
Yes!

143
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,390
Glad to have you.

144
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,810
Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.

145
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,180
And this is Ging-san's son and
one of the Zoldyck family!

146
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,730
Oh, sorry...

147
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,120
It's no big deal.

148
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,970
Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?

149
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,580
We weren't born with the talent...

150
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,420
Talent, talent... Guess I have a
talent for saying "talent," huh?

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,840
In this brief period of time,
they've become friends.

152
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,340
Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.

153
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,350
And also blessed with good friends.

154
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,290
Gon might be the real deal...

155
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,650
He'll find you soon, Ging-san.

156
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,550
Not enough... Not enough...

157
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,260
I need more, bigger food.

158
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,110
It's been days...

159
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,150
No, it's been months since it last rained here.

160
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,810
The weather is unusual this year.

161
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,290
It's possible that this is affecting
the wildlife in some way.

162
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,300
So the insect with the large leg

163
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,670
could have been a mutation
influenced by those conditions.

164
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,790
But why would it have grown larger?

165
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,790
In order to survive, right?

166
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,680
If it's bigger, it'd have a better
chance of securing food.

167
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,350
But that would mean it'd need more, as well.

168
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,100
Being larger doesn't always aid survival.

169
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,330
I believe that this is

170
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,310
related to the Chimera Ant's unique
nature, not to the environment.

171
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,770
I agree.

172
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,570
Because they reproduce in a way
not found in any other organism.

173
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,110
What do you mean?

174
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,660
They reproduce through a special
process known as phagogenesis.

175
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,950
Phagogenesis?

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,660
What's that?

177
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,280
Phagogenesis

178
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,590
When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,

179
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,340
she is able to pass traits on

180
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,250
from those organisms to the next generation.

181
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,830
And she can also eat multiple species

182
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,170
to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.

183
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,250
With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs.

184
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,830
The first generation of births has
no reproductive capability,

185
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,300
so they become worker or soldier ants.

186
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,220
They work in service to the queen
and her eventual successors.

187
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,790
Those successors are the king and
queen of the next generation.

188
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,880
The queen is thus always looking to
consume the genes of strong organisms,

189
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,550
so she can pass them to her offspring.

190
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,780
And she may consume any species she
particularly likes to extinction.

191
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,170
To extinction?!

192
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,050
Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her

193
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,270
to consume her own weight many
times over, in a single day.

194
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,770
That's why Chimera Ants are
under a class-1 quarantine.

195
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,280
So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?

196
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,140
Judging from the size of that claw,
her length is at least two meters.

197
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,660
That thing could devour a human in no time.

198
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,170
Yes, you are correct.

199
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,050
Stay back! Go away!

200
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,930
B-Big Brother...

201
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,520
Reina, stay close to me.

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,670
Take that!

203
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,170
It's okay now.

204
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,330
Thank you!

205
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,090
You can count on your big brother.

206
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,620
I'll always keep you safe!

207
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,290
Yeah!

208
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,450
Okay, let's go home.

209
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,340
Hey, my brother was amazing!

210
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,310
There was a big snake, but he was like,

211
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,730
"Stay back! Go away!"

212
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,060
Whack!

213
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,370
Come now, don't wave your spoon around.

214
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,450
It's bad manners.

215
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,500
But that's what he did.

216
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,440
Yes, yes. I know.

217
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,900
That was very brave.

218
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,950
If a big snake showed up,
your mother might be too scared to move.

219
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,980
You're truly a young man, Kurt.

220
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,960
Yeah, I guess.

221
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,540
You're already nine...

222
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,170
And a reliable big brother.

223
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,470
You must continue to look after Reina.

224
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm counting on you, Kurt.

225
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,170
I'm counting on you, Brother.

226
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,730
Yeah, you can count on me!

227
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,220
I'll keep you both safe forever!

228
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,740
This area is about to hatch.

229
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,610
Soldiers, hear me!

230
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,520
My duty is to give birth to the King.

231
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,940
In order to give birth to a strong king,

232
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,130
I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.

233
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,270
Search out the best food you can find!

234
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,740
This area will also hatch soon.

235
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,520
I require a large nest in
which to birth a strong king.

236
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,670
I also need time to rest, free from concerns
of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy.

237
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,040
In order to give birth to a strong
king, I need strong soldiers.

238
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,530
Are you okay?

239
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,490
Uh-huh, thank you...

240
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,450
Hey, Brother...

241
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,330
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you.

242
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,530
Sure.

243
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,920
Let's wake up early tomorrow
and go fishing at the river.

244
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah.

245
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,840
We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.

246
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,510
Uh-huh, I can't wait.

247
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,220
This is enough fish for a feast.

248
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,860
Yep.

249
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,820
B-Big Brother...

250
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,620
Big Brother!

251
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,900
Reina, it's okay.

252
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,420
I'll...

253
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,770
Your big brother will protect you!

254
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,720
I promised Mom!

255
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,220
I'll keep you safe!

256
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,620
Go away...

257
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,480
Go away!

258
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,490
This is delicious,

259
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,640
and very nutritious...

260
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,490
The ultimate food.

261
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,250
I need more of this species.

262
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,440
They're the ones I mentioned on
the phone, Gon and Killua.

263
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,140
Oh, I'm Lin Koshi.

264
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,340
N-Nice to meet you.

265
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,870
My name's Podungo Lapoy.

266
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,890
Glad to have you on board.

267
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,760
Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san.

268
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,550
Hey.

269
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,020
Let's get down to business.
Where was the leg discovered?

270
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,810
On the beach over there.

271
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,230
A-According to the locals,

272
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,280
it washed up on sh-shore.

273
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,210
There's a forest right behind us...

274
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,670
It'll be difficult to find the
Chimera Ant if it ran in there.

275
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,070
We can't be certain that it's still alive.

276
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,680
We don't even know if it ended up
on the same island its leg drifted to.

277
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,720
Let's find out, then.

278
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,690
Here, remember this scent.

279
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,190
I'll help, too!

280
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,390
Huh?

281
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,450
His nose is as sharp as a dog's.

282
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,110
He can't find anything...

283
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,890
The scent may have disappeared.

284
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,720
It was raining.

285
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,880
I couldn't find anything, either.

286
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,980
That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.

287
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,920
It may have washed ashore elsewhere.

288
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,230
In which direction do the currents flow here?

289
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,400
It's complicated...

290
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
The direction is reversed
between day and night.

291
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,100
And it also changes with the seasons.

292
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,990
I've even heard it's different on certain days.

293
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,500
So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...

294
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,950
It's too early to give up.

295
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,540
Let's split up and search.

296
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,000
You're right.

297
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,130
No luck...

298
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,020
Continuing to search blindly is pointless.

299
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,330
Let's return to Yorknew City.

300
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,160
We may be able to find a new lead.

301
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,360
Her length is at least two meters.

302
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
That thing could devour a human in no time.

303
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,650
A voracious appetite...

304
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,680
Phagogenesis.

305
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,950
Your Majesty...

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,450
Oh, you can speak?

307
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,230
So that I may fully receive,

308
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,820
understand, and execute your orders.

309
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,590
That pleases me.

310
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
I assign you to be a squadron leader.

311
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,940
I am most grateful.

312
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,470
I already have your mission.

313
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,810
Lead all the soldiers here on a mission

314
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,870
to capture my food...

315
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,280
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.

316
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,440
At once!

317
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,500
A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.

318
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,680
Kite's worst fears have been realized.

319
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,130
Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction.

320
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,070
My name is Gon Freecss.

321
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,760
My name is Killua Zoldyck.

322
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,880
What's your name?
