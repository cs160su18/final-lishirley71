2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,730
Do it, Knuckle!

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,990
Damn it!

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,770
That bastard...

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,750
He...

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,130
He...

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,470
looked at me like I was trash!

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,780
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,750
Yeah, I got it!

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,320
Sorry, master...

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,260
We're both fools.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,790
There's something more important
than the world right now!

13
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,020
A x False x Rage

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,330
Though the central tower's third floor

15
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,020
escaped destruction, having been
cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,740
it had been blown slightly to
the left of its original position,

17
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,040
barely keeping the building's appearance intact
while maintaining a precarious balance.

18
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,080
Nearby, in the middle of the
central tower's lower portion,

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,730
which had been reduced to rubble
resembling an ancient gladiator arena...

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,560
I am a foolish servant of the King,

21
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,930
letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey.

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,670
That's how I should approach it.

23
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,940
That's the impression I should give them.

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,340
Where are you hiding, little rats?

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,270
Come out here, so I can squash you!

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,960
I know he'll show himself again...

27
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,520
To exploit the opening just before I explode.

28
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,870
It's time.

29
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,610
Adding inte—

30
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,260
Shut up!

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,270
While Youpi was allowing a
false rage to consume him,

32
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,040
putting on a show of shouting
in order to draw out Knuckle...

33
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,270
No matter what happens outside,
my goal is to pin this guy here.

34
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,740
That's all I need to do!

35
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,790
Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,

36
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,520
tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,010
maintained just enough distance
as to go unnoticed by Morel

38
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:10,470
as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out
his escape from Smoky Jail.

39
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,990
Beneath the northern section of the palace

40
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,300
Border Guard Area F

41
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,300
Palace

42
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,260
was a large area, with warehouses laid
out in the shape of a dragonfly.

43
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:30,790
Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A

44
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:30,790
Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E
Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C

45
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,660
Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,

46
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,950
was where Bizeff had created a private zone

47
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,790
with his warehouse for hiding women.

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,310
Having learned the warehouse's
location from Marcos,

49
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,750
Ikalgo was making his way there by truck

50
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,300
via a direct, five-kilometer road.

51
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,060
By the time Ikalgo had reached

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,390
the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,970
his Satellite Dragonflies had already
arrived at the warehouse.

54
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,630
The door's open...

55
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,320
This is a good sign.

56
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,700
Palm put Bizeff to sleep
and headed for the palace.

57
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,500
When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock
the door in his rush to follow her.

58
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,250
That's the likely explanation.

59
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,210
Brovada's in the border guard area?

60
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,220
This meant that Ikalgo

61
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,720
had no choice but to face Brovada.

62
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,800
Brovada doesn't trust me.

63
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,580
Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?

64
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,490
Stay calm...

65
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,120
Stay calm and figure out what he
knows and what he doesn't,

66
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,820
in order to stay alive!

67
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,380
What happened during our encounter
that aroused his suspicion?

68
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,130
Was there something unnatural
about my imitation of Flutter?

69
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,350
I suppose it would be strange for Hagya
to order me to go underground.

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,750
But since they didn't stop me on the spot,

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,480
my mistake must not have been fatal.

72
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,570
Rather, something aroused an inkling
of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind.

73
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,280
And Brovada's down here because he
wants to confirm those doubts!

74
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680
Was it small enough that I can explain?

75
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,280
Or was it big enough that he
only wants final verification?

76
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,210
No room for optimism.

77
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,800
I should assume it was a big mistake.

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,020
Is anyone here?

79
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,680
I am a messenger from the secretary!

80
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,160
Depending on the response...

81
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,660
No, I have to assume

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,940
that if he has a chance, he'll attack...

83
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,890
Or he'll kill me!

84
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,750
I am a messenger from the secretary!

85
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,940
The secretary ordered me to come here!

86
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,460
Thinker Bell!

87
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,950
If you're here, you must come with me at once!

88
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,520
Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.

89
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,100
This was meant to reassure
Palm that he was an ally.

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,760
Why didn't you respond?

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Where's everyone else?

92
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,970
I d-don't know anything about
what's happening outside...

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm not allowed to talk to anyone
other than the secretary.

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,470
She had assumed

95
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,610
that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.

96
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,370
The other women thought the same thing.

97
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,240
Each room had a phone exclusively
for communication with Bizeff,

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,870
so it was illogical for him to send
a messenger, hence their suspicion.

99
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,420
They believed that a visit from a stranger

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,180
must be a test to see if they could
stay calm and follow orders

101
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,230
under unusual circumstances,

102
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,000
so they refused to speak to Ikalgo.

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,020
However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor.

104
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,570
Is this the place?

105
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,400
The women had a much higher chance
of surviving if they stayed here.

106
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,480
Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about
keeping them alive, much less protecting them.

107
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,090
There's writing in Nen!

108
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:50,420
The characters, formed by aura,
could only be seen when using Gyo.

109
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,570
It was less likely that Bizeff

110
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,110
would find a message that wasn't
on paper or some other device.

111
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,920
"Heading to the palace.

112
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,100
If I don't make contact before the mission,

113
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,440
assume I am dead."

114
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,440
Ikalgo had expected this.

115
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,060
But he still felt as much anguish as
if he had lost part of his own body.

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,050
Palm...

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,710
If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,

118
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,490
use your Satellite Dragonflies and
telepathy to support the team.

119
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,470
Got it.

120
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,680
Pretend that you're reporting
to your Squadron Leader,

121
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,470
when you're actually reporting to Meleoron.

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,480
So you want me to feed the enemy lies,
to throw them off?

123
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,980
Yes. It's a crucial task.
I'm counting on you.

124
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,240
That will only be possible

125
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
if they don't know Meleoron is here,
or that I've switched sides.

126
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,230
Which means that, since he
is already suspicious of me,

127
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,820
I must eliminate Brovada!

128
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,270
Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?

129
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,770
Yeah... I did.

130
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,770
Hagya, huh?

131
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,400
Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?

132
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,600
Okay, the fake is dead.

133
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,240
Empty?

134
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,870
Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya.

135
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,380
The suspect is now dead!

136
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,910
Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,

137
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,360
I can move around freely.

138
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,400
Still, I never heard anything about
Hagya changing his name!

139
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,850
What's he called now?

140
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,010
It's true that I really knew
nothing of his new name...

141
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,070
But will they believe that?

142
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,690
I must think of a reason they'll accept
if I encounter any of them.

143
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,420
No, that won't work!

144
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,630
Brovada opened fire without warning!

145
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,170
That shows they think anyone who doesn't
know Hagya's new name is an enemy.

146
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,770
If they find me, there'll be a battle!

147
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,510
I have to go back up there expecting that!

148
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,770
Please enter your code number.

149
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,090
The elevator isn't ascending!

150
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,160
Don't tell me that he came
down here without knowing

151
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,290
about the passcode system.

152
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,430
This is my chance!

153
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,890
I have two options to pick from!

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,650
Show yourself!

155
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,220
It's nearly been five minutes since
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.

156
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,060
Which means the Nen I've
loaned him is nearing 7,000.

157
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,790
Is that enough to guarantee that he won't
pay off the full balance with one hit?

158
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,750
I just...

159
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,930
I just have to avoid a direct hit.

160
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,640
The worst possible scenario
would be that I'm hit

161
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,750
by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7
Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me.

162
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,130
If that's gonna happen,

163
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm better off buying time,
waiting for him to go bust.

164
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,110
But that means I'll have to wait

165
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,510
for at least ten minutes.

166
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,510
Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!

167
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,910
I have to make him explode once more.

168
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,900
Or else we'll run out of time!

169
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,940
Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!

170
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,530
You look happy, monster!

171
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,540
He fell for my trap, for my false rage.

172
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,190
I've been looking for you, cockroach.

173
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,550
Make this damn fly that's
following me around shut up!

174
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,550
Damn Fly

175
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,490
Every time it squeaks,
I'm reminded of your annoying face!

176
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,480
Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time.

177
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,060
But I'll be faking it...

178
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,700
It's time.

179
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,180
Adding interest.

180
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
Just shut up!

181
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,550
Right before I explode, I pause for a moment.

182
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,750
He'll try to attack during that opening.

183
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:02,200
But if I stay calm when my rage takes over,
I can control my growth.

184
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,830
Get this thing off me right now...

185
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,090
Or I'll kill you!

186
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,950
I'll blow every last one of you
to smithereens, you scum!

187
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,550
When he tries to take advantage of
the opening I give him, he'll be open.

188
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,550
And I'll take advantage of that.

189
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,970
That won't happen, you giant lump.

190
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,270
You're gonna die on your knees right here.

191
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,120
The next one...

192
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,620
The next tick of the interest will be the gong.

193
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,260
I'll show you who the cockroach is here.

194
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,900
It's time.

195
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,540
Adding interest.

196
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,260
This will work.

197
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,910
I have time to land one... No, two hits!

198
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:27,310
I have time to punch him in the face,
and get out of the way before the explosion!

199
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,820
Take this, pig!

200
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,930
This one's for Shoot!

201
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,840
And the next one's also for Shoot!

202
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,260
Is something wrong with me?

203
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,740
I was never that close to him...

204
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,230
Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him.

205
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,920
I don't even know when he
climbed to the rank of "friend"...

206
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,540
So why am I this desperate to avenge him?

207
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,060
It's not even "vengeance," since he's not dead...

208
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,830
Well, I guess a lot of it is that
we've faced death together...

209
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:16,050
Anyone who's risked their
life with you is a friend.

210
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,310
But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!

211
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,690
He ignored someone who entered
a fight with him expecting to die?

212
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,800
Has he no sympathy as a warrior?

213
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,170
Damn Ant!

214
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,230
I'm getting more and more pissed off!

215
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,700
I'll give him a third punch for myself!

216
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,570
Wow... I'm amazing myself!

217
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,920
I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!

218
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,710
And I haven't finished throwing my punch?

219
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,980
Wait...

220
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,350
Is this what they mean?

221
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,170
Time's almost frozen.

222
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,290
Everything slows down...

223
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,220
right before you die?

224
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,240
He stopped the explosion!

225
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,260
He got me!

226
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,750
He was actually keeping his cool...

227
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,130
I can't stop!

228
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Sorry, Shoot...

229
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,760
I screwed up!

230
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,560
The interest won't be enough to pay for this.

231
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,620
It's over...

232
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,100
Shoot...

233
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,680
Boss...

234
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,810
Everyone...

235
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,930
Everything is...

236
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,080
up to you.

237
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,800
Thunderbolt!

238
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,060
Lightning?

239
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,940
He's completely paralyzed...

240
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,690
This is my chance!

241
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,460
If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!

242
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,560
I did it! I did it! I did it!

243
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm done! I can't do any more!

244
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,980
Crap, I almost died!

245
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,340
I could see the pearly gates...

246
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,520
My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.

247
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,140
I hit him eight times!

248
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,500
What just happened?

249
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,630
I'm sure he fell for my trap.

250
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,260
What happened?

251
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,510
That's obvious.

252
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,360
I didn't notice there was an attack
coming from a different direction...

253
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,740
Is that possible?

254
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,660
That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive

255
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,770
until it was right over me?

256
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,030
The same thing happened before.

257
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,150
Before I even realized it,
this little nuisance was on me.

258
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,740
There were no signs at all.

259
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,430
I saw him back at the staircase...

260
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,690
Did he do it?

261
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,380
Sorry, but what's about to happen is

262
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,200
just me blowing off some steam.

263
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,550
Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.

264
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,840
Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?

265
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,180
Ika-tta say I'd go with Ikalgo.

266
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,140
Ikan agree with that!
