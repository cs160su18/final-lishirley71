2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,360
Who are you guys?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,990
We booked this place for the night.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,860
Get lost!

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,770
We're here to talk.

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,860
Would you please leave the city?

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,870
Been a long time since I heard those words.

8
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,040
Pirates x And x Guesses

9
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,300
Then no need for talk.
Use force to make us leave.

10
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,550
I don't care how many of you attack at once.

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,810
If you can move me from this ring,

12
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,470
I'll take you to see our boss.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,690
We just have to move you out of the ring?

14
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,620
If it's brawn you want, I'm your man.

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,570
This guy's terrible.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,480
He's taking too long just to
produce that degree of Ren.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,670
You're pretty strong...

18
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,840
Stop it!

19
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,400
I lose... Let me go!

20
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,470
He admitted defeat.

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,970
Why didn't you let him go?

22
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,020
I explained the rules.

23
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,300
You lose if you step outside the ring.

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,190
Anything else, including admitting
defeat, is totally meaningless.

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,940
You kicked me, then stepped
outside the ring of fire.

26
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,990
You've lost.

27
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,820
Oh! Crap!

28
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,340
Hold on! Give me another try!

29
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,580
Don't bother, Gon...

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,950
You're probably looking to
use your new technique.

31
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,580
But you shouldn't reveal it in
front of all these people.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,590
Just let me handle this.

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,710
What's this? You gonna pair up now?

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,970
I'll be using this.

35
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,840
You wouldn't...

36
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,490
There, I win.

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,240
D-Damn little brat!

38
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,230
You made up the rules...

39
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,500
Don't get upset.

40
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah, my bad...

41
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,690
Come with me.

42
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,350
I'll take you to the boss.

43
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,620
Eh, so your boss is in here?

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,410
Boss, we have visitors.

45
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,410
Who are these guys?

46
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,410
They want to chase us out of town.

47
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,160
Chase us out?

48
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,420
Ah...

49
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's have a contest.

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,050
If you win, we'll leave the island.

51
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,520
However, we choose the contest.

52
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,300
How does that sound?

53
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,810
What happens if we lose?

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,130
Nothing.

55
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,560
You'll just have to leave.

56
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,510
Okay, let's do this!

57
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,410
The theme of this battle is sports.

58
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,450
Each of these members will challenge
you to a match in their best sport.

59
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,320
One win per person!

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,980
The first side to eight wins will be the victor.

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,450
I'm up first... I'll go with boxing.

62
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,570
Well? Who's up?

63
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,600
I've got this.

64
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,970
There's one special rule.

65
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,840
You may use any item created by Nen.

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,070
What?

67
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,590
You can't call that boxing!

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,510
Don't worry, I'll only use my fists.

69
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,600
That rule's for your benefit.

70
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,950
Wanna tag out?

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,360
No, I'll do it.

72
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,860
Fight!

73
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,740
I know what's going on here...

74
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,910
There's a reason you chose boxing!

75
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,620
You're also an Emitter, right?

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,630
We're fighting at close range,
within a finite space.

77
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,380
This is the ideal situation for an Emitter.

78
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,030
However, you made one mistake!

79
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,690
Not anticipating that my power
could be stronger than yours!

80
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,640
Wow! He can't dodge that flurry!

81
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,550
Yes, he's down! Too easy!

82
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,350
No, it was a simultaneous hit.

83
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,010
What just happened?

84
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,260
Why?

85
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,050
These guys didn't see what happened?

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,790
He used teleportation.

87
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,680
Teleportation?

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,170
Of only his fist, with a short uppercut.

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,760
His goal was to land a knockout counterstrike.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,930
It was obvious.

91
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,590
Seems he's out cold...

92
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,940
That's one win for us.

93
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,210
Damn.

94
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,960
Bah.

95
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,900
Reaching eight wins with these
members will be impossible.

96
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,060
Meaning...

97
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,620
Okay, I'm up next...

98
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,450
I'll go with juggling soccer balls.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,150
Then I'm up...

100
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,890
Wait, Gon.

101
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,330
Indeed, that would be wise.

102
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,840
Okay, I'm up next!

103
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,960
A little girl?

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,870
Now I'll have to take care not to injure you.

105
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,470
Injure me with juggling?

106
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,460
We're allowed to attack using Nen.

107
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,480
Provided you don't touch
the ball with your hands.

108
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,980
I understand.

109
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,140
Moving anywhere inside the building is allowed.

110
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,470
Whoever drops their ball first loses.

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,360
Right! Got it!

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,670
Okay, let's get started.

113
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,610
Ready...

114
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,970
Go!

115
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,370
What?

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,750
That was harder than I expected...

117
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,950
I lose.

118
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,650
I'm up next, then.

119
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,250
You wanna go, big guy?

120
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,010
You bet! Prepare yourself, brat!

121
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,260
Ready, begin!

122
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,510
I'll crush you!

123
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,460
Oh, sorry about that...

124
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,650
I stepped outside the ring.

125
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,310
Now I see... That's what they're doing.

126
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,270
That's eight wins.

127
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,050
We're the victors.

128
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,280
Get out.

129
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,710
And we can do as we please in this city.

130
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,840
Damn it, you brat! Come back here!

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
We need to fight again!

132
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,820
When you saw we couldn't
win with this lineup,

133
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,060
you decided to lose deliberately,
and gather information, huh?

134
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,120
But once a party has lost,
they can't make another attempt.

135
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,780
But it's okay if we simply
switch out one member.

136
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,100
It was a worthwhile risk.

137
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
You can count us out.

138
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,820
Huh?

139
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,520
We've accomplished our original objective,

140
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,790
keeping the Bombers from completing the game.

141
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,480
It will be impossible for them to
assemble a team of fifteen.

142
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,080
You should probably give up on this contest.

143
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,270
If you end up obtaining the card,
you'll just become a target.

144
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,850
They don't get it...

145
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,730
It makes sense to obtain this card quickly.

146
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,520
To avoid potential internal conflict.

147
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,050
Exactly.

148
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,730
Huh?

149
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,300
You need at least fifteen people to participate.

150
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,810
Even if you use Clone,

151
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,690
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]

152
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,740
you can only obtain three
copies of Patch of Shore.

153
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,500
This event was designed to incite infighting.

154
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,000
That's what you meant.

155
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,250
Brutal...

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,920
I had to think about that, since I
didn't understand right away.

157
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,580
Assuming that we four are capable of winning,

158
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,160
we still need four more up to the task.

159
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,520
And ideally, they'd already
be in a party of eleven.

160
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,900
Do you have any leads?

161
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,360
Book.

162
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,780
Looking at the names on my list,
Chrollo's probably the strongest.

163
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,940
But Kurapika said he's definitely a fake.

164
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,870
Who is it, then?

165
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,660
Well, it's probably a member of the Troupe.

166
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,270
Why would a member of the Troupe be here?

167
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,670
Maybe to beat the game?

168
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,430
But wouldn't they have used their own name?

169
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,170
That's true.

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,390
We can use Sight Vision.

171
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,220
Huh?

172
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,710
If this person isn't here to beat the game,

173
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,070
they won't bother to collect cards.

174
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,810
Oh, that's right.

175
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,440
0 cards in restricted slots
6 cards in free slots

176
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,240
This guy's not even trying.

177
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,690
His only cards are for food and water.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,280
That makes it easier to invite them.

179
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,130
But if it really is a member of the
Troupe, we won't invite them.

180
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,590
We'll just ask a few questions.

181
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,550
Then there's no point in bothering.

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,460
Since it's definitely one of them.

183
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,830
Finding out who they are is important,
but I'd rather learn why they're here!

184
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,470
Are you an idiot?!

185
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,590
You're gonna ask them why they're here?

186
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,440
They aren't gonna tell you!

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,390
Yeah, I'm an idiot!

188
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,970
I'm an idiot, so I'm still gonna ask!

189
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,640
Then go right ahead!

190
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,170
I sure will!

191
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,300
Will they be okay?

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,730
This is perfectly normal for them.

193
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,050
I'm off, then!

194
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,850
Knock yourself out.

195
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,820
Accompany on!

196
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,990
Chrollo Lucilfer.

197
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,810
No way...

198
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,520
Hisoka!

199
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,670
Well, well...

200
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,820
I have unexpected visitors.

201
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,820
It's been a while.

202
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,080
As I thought.

203
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,030
You've matured quite a lot.

204
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,930
It appears that you found
an excellent teacher.

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,590
As I anticipated, you grow more
appetizing with every day.

206
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,990
Wh-Who is this pervy freak?

207
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,970
Are you their teacher?

208
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,020
No, it doesn't seem to be him.

209
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,270
Stop it!

210
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,310
She's the one?

211
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,050
So what do you want with me...
No, with Chrollo?

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,360
I have a question.

213
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,620
Why are you here?

214
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,170
Well, what to do?

215
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,210
If I talk, I know how they'll react.

216
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,250
They'll do all they can to keep the spiders from the Nen exorcist.

217
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,440
That would certainly be entertaining.

218
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,250
But I have delayed my fight
with Chrollo long enough.

219
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,260
I'm looking for Chrollo.

220
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,020
There's actually a way

221
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,150
to remove Kurapika's Nen from him.

222
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,810
You can purge it.

223
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,410
So you knew?

224
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,660
Then that makes this easier.

225
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,220
I'm looking for Chrollo,
to give him that information,

226
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,910
but I have no leads.

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,160
That's when I remembered

228
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,750
that some of the spiders were
interested in this game.

229
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,750
I thought that maybe they would
know Chrollo's whereabouts.

230
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,880
And by choosing this name, I ensure
that they will come to me.

231
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,190
I get it.

232
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,470
He was just pretending to
be a member of the Troupe.

233
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,140
Uh-huh.

234
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,360
Now, it is my turn for a question.

235
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,230
You didn't come here just
to ask that, did you?

236
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,770
No, I did.

237
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,010
Um...

238
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,420
Actually, we're looking for
people who are really strong.

239
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,500
Won't you please join us?

240
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,160
Hmm? Sure.

241
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,170
Why are you looking for strong people?

242
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Wait, h-hold on... I'm against this.

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
It's too dangerous!

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Yeah, you don't know who this guy is, Bisky!

245
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,180
Oh? That's not true.

246
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,530
I can sense that he's a kindred spirit.

247
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,550
He's lying.

248
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,290
We should head to the
City of Love just ahead, Aiai.

249
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,970
It's a great place for new meetings.

250
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,870
Perhaps you can find strong people there.

251
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,280
What did you mean about him lying?

252
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,520
Technically, I should say he
wasn't speaking the truth.

253
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,890
How could you tell?

254
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,860
I had a gut feeling.

255
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,590
A gut feeling?!

256
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,030
After lying for fifty years,
I can recognize a fellow liar.

257
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,590
That's a convincing argument.

258
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,860
Since he's hiding something,

259
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,060
we'll keep him around to see what's up.

260
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,090
Plus, he really is strong, right?

261
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,350
Uh-huh...

262
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,320
Hey, Hisoka!

263
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,590
You walk in front!

264
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,620
We need ten more members, correct?

265
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,080
Yeah...

266
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,000
We hope to find others like you
who aren't interested in cards.

267
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,760
Isn't everyone else here to beat the game?

268
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,260
I can't imagine there are too
many eccentrics like myself.

269
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,630
He's definitely hiding something.

270
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,990
By the way,

271
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,450
did you use someone's power to warp to me?

272
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,140
That was one of the spells in this game.

273
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,780
Oh, so that's what it was.

274
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,350
You need to buy spells from stores, right?

275
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,150
Something does seem fishy.

276
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,380
He isn't being honest.

277
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,620
In other words, there's something
inconsistent in his story.

278
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,200
He came here to find spiders who
might know Chrollo's location.

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,300
There's something off about that explanation.

280
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,300
City of Love, Aiai

281
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,770
Where are my glasses?

282
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,570
Why not give them to her?

283
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,800
You might become friends.

284
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,890
Hey...

285
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,580
Watch where you're going!

286
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,660
Be more careful.

287
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,950
S-Sorry...

288
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm gonna be late!

289
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,960
You weren't supposed to apologize...

290
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,940
You should have told her to watch where
she was going and started a fight.

291
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,080
Stop it!

292
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,220
Release me! I'll scream...

293
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,440
Go ahead and scream.

294
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,720
No one's coming to save you.

295
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,520
Hold it!

296
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,410
Let go of her!

297
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,750
That hurt...

298
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,070
How could you fall for such a cliché?!

299
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,990
You want me to model for your hairstyling?

300
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,740
Please allow me to cut your long, lovely hair.

301
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,110
Of course.

302
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,120
There's no point in hanging around this city.

303
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,010
Hisoka, let's head somewhere else.

304
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,640
Oh?

305
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,000
But we won't be bored here.

306
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,220
Bored...

307
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,660
That's it!

308
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,010
That's what was wrong.

309
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,570
This place...

310
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,730
This place is the problem!

311
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,190
If I entered this game to find someone,

312
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,270
what would I do?

313
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,230
I would see how important
the spell cards are.

314
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,940
Gon and Bisky ran into Hisoka

315
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,890
while I was outside, taking the Hunter Exam.

316
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,280
That means they encountered him

317
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,030
while they were training near Masadora.

318
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,520
Hisoka's been to Masadora!

319
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,790
Right, normally it makes no sense
for him to leave Masadora.

320
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,920
Because most players pass through
the city, in search of spell cards.

321
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,170
If he were truly looking for the Troupe,
he wouldn't have left Masadora.

322
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,430
But we won't be bored here.

323
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,580
He's bored because he has nothing to do.

324
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,440
So he isn't looking for anyone.

325
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,370
No...

326
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,230
He's already found them!

327
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,940
That must be it!

328
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,940
That's in line with what Bisky said.

329
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Hisoka already met up with the Troupe,

330
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,330
and he's waiting for something.

331
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,890
What is he waiting for?

332
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,200
That's obvious...

333
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,100
The Nen purger.

334
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,950
The Nen purger is here, on Greed Island!

335
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,880
Hisoka and the Troupe know this.

336
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,540
I can't tell Gon yet...

337
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,210
He can't keep a secret.

338
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,970
If Hisoka realizes we know, he'll disappear.

339
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,390
If he leaves, we'll be down a member.

340
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,470
And we won't know what
the Troupe is doing.

341
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,510
We can't let that happen.

342
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,980
Hey, Killua... I've been thinking.

343
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,640
We should probably try to recruit Tsezgerra.

344
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,560
Even if he doesn't join,
we should meet with him,

345
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,720
so he'll be on our binder list.

346
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,270
It would be good to know what they're doing.

347
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,590
Binder? I can find out!

348
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,480
Hisoka, let me see your binder.

349
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,100
I want to see if Tsezgerra

350
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,370
is on the list of players you've met.

351
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,130
List?

352
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,860
That's perfect!

353
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,390
If I asked questions, Hisoka would be suspicious.

354
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,010
But Gon knows nothing,
so Hisoka won't suspect a thing.

355
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,270
Book.

356
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,260
If Hisoka refuses to show us the screen,
that'll support my theory.

357
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,900
There's Tsezgerra.

358
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,700
Really?

359
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, right here.

360
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,590
Huh?

361
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,630
He showed us? No way!

362
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,840
There aren't any Troupe members...

363
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,540
Was I being paranoid?

364
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,570
Is Hisoka actually still looking for them?

365
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,800
Then, Hisoka, recite this spell...

366
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,510
We'll do the talking.

367
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,820
Contact on.

368
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,990
Tsezgerra.

369
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,310
My Texture Surprise

370
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,940
really is so very useful.

371
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,970
Shizuku
Phinks
Franklin
Shalnark

372
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,070
Hisoka's ability fools Killua and his friends.

373
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,690
Is Hisoka a friend or foe?

374
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:08,710
G.I. Tutorial

375
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

376
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,330
Today, we introduce the card Paladin's Necklace.

377
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:18,710
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

378
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,970
This card can reflect enemy spells,
and tell you if other cards are real.

379
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,460
Are you real?

380
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,300
Huh?

381
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,170
Continue!

382
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,550
Next time: A x Heated x Showdown.

383
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,700
I win!

384
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,480
One more time!

385
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,720
Gon, where are you going?
