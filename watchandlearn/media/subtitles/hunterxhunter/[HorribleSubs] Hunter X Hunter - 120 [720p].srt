2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,920
No way...

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,600
Where did he go, in that condition?!

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,940
Shoot...

5
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,990
Fake X And X Real

6
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,300
You intend to fight?

7
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,480
You will abandon your original plan, and
commit yourself to a baseless assumption?

8
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,060
You really believe...

9
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,060
Smoky Jail, undo!

10
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,340
I see you've made your decision.

11
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,500
Once I stopped to think about it,
it was pretty simple.

12
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,040
You used your cocoon after I played my card.

13
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,640
Since you went into hiding
only after learning my agenda,

14
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,620
I knew that was your ability,

15
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,470
and that it was a trap.

16
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,480
Your lack of reaction when I lifted
my pipe to strike confirmed it.

17
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,520
It made no sense that you showed
no sign of reacting at all.

18
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,790
Fifteen minutes.

19
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,900
That was how long I expected you to take

20
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,210
before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.

21
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,470
During that time, I intended to slip
through the smoke and move freely.

22
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,230
You trapped me within that barrier
to separate me from the King, yes?

23
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,460
Meaning, as long as your
prison of smoke was there,

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,560
your allies would see it and
conclude that I was still inside.

25
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,920
I decided to take advantage

26
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,260
of that misconception, and
quietly dispose of your friends.

27
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,020
I knew you would hesitate long enough
to give me plenty of time to act.

28
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,420
You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes
waiting in front of an empty cocoon?

29
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,760
You really underestimated me.

30
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,560
No, on the contrary, it appears...

31
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,740
I overestimated you!

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,890
He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?

33
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,060
If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail,
I wouldn't have seen a thing!

34
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,000
You should have waited longer...

35
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,290
Because my strategy was a last resort.

36
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,170
To be honest, I was upset by the
fact that I'd been trapped.

37
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,080
Not a very good diversion strategy.

38
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,530
You just contradicted yourself.

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,760
You made it through the smoke just fine!

40
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,690
At that point, that was all there was to it.

41
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,190
I was under the impression that
you were a more capable soldier...

42
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,430
One who would carry out his original
plan and be faithful to his mission.

43
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,950
However, you made some wild guesses
and removed the barrier.

44
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,950
I must thank you.

45
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,910
Thank you.

46
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,340
Thank you. Thank you.

47
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,610
Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,110
Thank you.

49
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,960
Thank you. Thank you.

50
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,800
Deep Purple!

51
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,530
Run!

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,540
I can't destroy them?

53
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,780
They just break up and reform?

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,780
He's invincible?

55
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,790
Thank you! Bye-bye!

56
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't be fooled...

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,890
He's playing mind games!

58
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,540
My decision to attack the
cocoon was the best option.

59
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,430
No, the moment I second-guess myself,
I've played into his hands.

60
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,550
My next job

61
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,860
is to predict his objective, and stop him...

62
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,390
To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,

63
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,310
to find and eliminate my companions,

64
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,550
and to reunite with the King!

65
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,810
That must be it...

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,730
His interests are consistent with mine.

67
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,320
There's no problem!

68
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,580
I'll take this!

69
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,090
He's fast!

70
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,840
I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!

71
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
He got me...

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,960
I can't use any other abilities.

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,680
If Deep Purple is undone,
I'll be completely helpless!

74
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I'll have to find a way to get by,
using Deep Purple alone.

75
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,110
Yo, are you

76
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,240
the esper?

77
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,250
What'd you do with Shoot, huh?

78
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,750
What?

79
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,500
Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...

80
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,870
The maximum number I could
produce in my current state.

81
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,260
I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.

82
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,270
I see what you're doing...

83
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll let you hit me once.

84
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,020
But in return...

85
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll take your life!

86
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,240
Okay, no one's here.

87
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,590
This is our chance to escape.

88
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,540
Let's go.

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,240
Man, they said we'd be safe here.

90
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,280
I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.

91
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,030
Since my stomach shrunk, that probably
means Cheetu-sama's dead...

92
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,560
And I haven't heard anything from
Flutter, so I guess that's it.

93
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,060
I'll leave to become a Queen!

94
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,060
I'll make you my second-in-command.

95
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,330
How's that?

96
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,070
Help...

97
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,590
Please...

98
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,200
get me out of here...

99
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,200
Help!

100
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,100
Oh, Secretary Bizeff...

101
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,070
You're in trouble.

102
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,250
I can't move my legs...

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,970
Whatever, let's go.

104
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,170
This looks dangerous.

105
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,300
What? Wait... Please!

106
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,450
I'm going to die!

107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,320
No can do... I can't move all that.

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,890
Then, could you call for help?

109
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,960
Like, seriously...

110
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,940
I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!

111
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,510
The boss is missing, our link
with the King is gone,

112
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,780
and the palace is a mess.

113
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,450
I have no reason to stay here!

114
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,910
I'll give you whatever reward you want!

115
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,660
There are mountains of treasure underground!

116
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,670
If you help me, I'll give you anything you want.

117
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,260
So please pull me out!

118
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,340
Where underground?

119
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,230
There's an area for the Supreme
Leader beyond the shelter.

120
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,840
I've been managing the treasure inside.

121
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,820
I'm the only one with access...

122
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,430
You'll give me anything I want?

123
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,530
You'd better keep your promise.

124
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,730
Or I'll kill you!

125
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,550
Treasure! Treasure!

126
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,790
Treasure, treasure, treasure!

127
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
It's over...

128
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,430
This nation is finished.

129
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,310
That was clearly proven

130
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,220
when the air assault began before
I was able to make any arrangements.

131
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,230
They're probably calling the Ants biological
weapons, to use them as an excuse...

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,610
If I'm captured by the Federation,

133
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,590
they'll force me to confess for a cover
story and throw me in prison for life,

134
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,460
or they'll execute me, so I can't talk.

135
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,190
I won't let them capture me...

136
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,860
I'm going to escape!

137
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,890
The smoke-user is now out of action.

138
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,660
Now, I'll go back to the palace,

139
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,510
evaluate the current situation,
and return to the King.

140
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,270
Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him,
the King will only find me a nuisance.

141
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,930
Beelzebub!

142
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,270
Lord of the Flies
Beelzebub

143
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,960
Go forth, my clones...

144
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,030
Identify the location and status of
every person inside the palace!

145
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,890
Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him

146
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,790
to disassemble into copies of himself
as small as one billionth his size.

147
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,100
He was able to control the size
and number of copies produced,

148
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,770
and the smaller the copies,
the more he could produce.

149
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,280
However, his main body,

150
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,180
which served as a control center,
could only be reduced to a bee's size.

151
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,400
Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,

152
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,040
my main body could not have escaped.

153
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,880
My combat capacity would
have been reduced by half.

154
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself

155
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,260
must know the incomparable difference in
strength between a clone and your own body.

156
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,310
Now that my main body is free,
I have no weaknesses.

157
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,170
You have lost.

158
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,910
You should have been more careful.

159
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,120
If you had, then when you realized

160
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,840
the cocoon was empty,
you should have wondered

161
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,390
whether what had been inside it
had actually escaped the barrier.

162
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,410
And if I had spoken to you
from outside the barrier,

163
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,520
you should have wondered whether
that was my real self.

164
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,340
The plan I executed was an act of desperation.

165
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,160
I could attempt to confuse your allies,
but my clones are mere husks.

166
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,310
Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,

167
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,670
even if it took a few casualties,
they would have noticed

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,920
that my clones were fakes!

169
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,980
Had you comprehended the truth,
and realized that my main body

170
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,180
remained within the barrier,

171
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,940
you would have understood my
ability, and searched for me.

172
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,800
If you had done so,

173
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,820
I would have had no way to
fight you in my reduced state...

174
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,600
In other words, if you had maintained
the barrier as per your original goal,

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,100
your allies may have suffered a bit,

176
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,660
but you would have been able to defeat me.

177
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,500
And I was ten-percent resolved
to accept that fate.

178
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,040
Your emotions were perfectly
aligned to accomplish that.

179
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,660
I suppose the explosion
must have thrown you off.

180
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,260
A pity...

181
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,850
However, I am now free.

182
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,810
Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!

183
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,620
From the start of the mission,
Morel's condition was less than optimal.

184
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,480
His exhaustion and impatience, combined
with the extreme tension of the situation,

185
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,710
clearly led him to the hasty decision
to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves.

186
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,340
However, he arrived at the
perfect time to support Knuckle,

187
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,610
keeping him from engaging Youpi alone.

188
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,160
As a result, it could be said that
he made the correct decision

189
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,640
to remove Smoky Jail at that time.

190
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,510
And it was more than simply
a product of coincidence.

191
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,030
It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of
experience played a role in saving him.

192
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,220
Upon entering the palace,

193
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,110
Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies

194
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,590
against that of his allies.

195
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,670
Subconsciously, he knew that they
had underestimated the enemy.

196
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,670
When he realized the length of time his allies
could hold out was shorter than anticipated,

197
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:15,420
he was led to attack the cocoon in order
to avoid struggling with the pros and cons

198
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,240
of removing Smoky Jail to go help them.

199
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,690
Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge
of the battlefield, saved his comrades.

200
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,620
The real one's hidden among the fakes,
trying to attack me, right?

201
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,290
This time, I'll land a counter on you!

202
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,920
Five were taken out...

203
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,460
I have eighty-four left!

204
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,570
The smoke ones are fake.

205
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,760
They feel completely different.

206
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,140
When the real one lands a hit, I'll know.

207
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,520
That's when you'll be finished!

208
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,260
Seventy-five left!

209
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,610
Seventy-two...

210
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,650
Seventy...

211
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,910
Pitou and the woman are on the
west tower's second floor.

212
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,240
Pitou appears to be healing the woman.

213
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,240
A boy, who appears to be an
enemy, is sitting nearby.

214
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,420
Three near the entrance to
the underground shelter...

215
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,730
Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!

216
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,510
They may be heading underground.

217
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,690
Welfin is behind them.

218
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,290
He appears to be following them.

219
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,940
The woman was injured by the dragon spears.

220
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,260
But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?

221
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,950
Could he be acquainted with the woman?

222
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,450
One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower...

223
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,070
The human captured a few days ago.

224
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,160
It will be born soon.

225
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,130
Oh, this area's crazy...

226
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,580
There are lots of enemies.

227
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,090
One, two, three...

228
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,280
But Youpi is taking them out quickly.

229
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,590
Youpi and approximately fifty enemies
are in the north area of the palace!

230
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,180
It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.

231
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,470
Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!

232
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,260
Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.

233
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,420
Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?

234
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,360
Only one of the thugs is real,
while the rest are made of smoke.

235
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,190
The number of puppets is not increasing

236
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,930
because he needs the pipe to make more.

237
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,370
It'll take Youpi less than a minute
to find the real one.

238
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,130
The King is gone! Where is he?

239
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,730
Everyone, return!

240
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,060
What's wrong?

241
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,150
You're running out of clones.

242
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,650
My attacks are too fast for you to get close.

243
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,160
Should I leave an opening for
him to come in and attack?

244
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,150
Carefully...

245
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,680
Act natural.

246
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,850
Here you go...

247
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,670
Come on!

248
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,190
He's a fake?

249
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,650
Wait...

250
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,450
You finally figured it out, idiot?

251
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,570
There never was a real one.

252
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,960
I'll kill you!

253
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,720
There is a real one, right here!

254
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,760
No kidding!

255
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,610
An aura explosion?

256
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,940
From Youpi?

257
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,760
Did he really need to use such an ability?

258
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm worried...

259
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,070
But locating the King is my first priority!

260
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,440
You saved me, boss!

261
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,750
If you hadn't set that restriction,

262
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,160
I would have snapped and rushed him!

263
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,650
Listen to me...

264
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,810
I will create only angry clones of you

265
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,820
when you've lost control of your temper.

266
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,510
If that happens, you are to join the clones,

267
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,560
and give careful thought to what must be done.

268
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,320
I got it.

270
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,530
After cooling down and thinking about it,

271
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,770
I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.

272
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,720
But if Shoot couldn't move on his own,
who would have moved him?

273
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,710
Damn... Stop thinking about it!

274
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,300
I need to focus on the opponent before me!

275
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,020
Where...

276
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,210
am I?

277
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,770
That's...

278
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,080
Uh-oh!

279
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,120
Hurry up!

280
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Go in before the entrance is blocked!

281
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,710
Damn, Bizeff is my prey!

282
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,210
If I knew what powers they had,
I could make a move.

283
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,740
Don't come any closer...

284
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,990
Pouf!

285
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,310
Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity.

286
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,170
I'm Gon.

287
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,720
And that's all there is to it.

288
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,450
I'm Killua!

289
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,830
And that's all there is to it.
