2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,740
Do you need something?

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,740
I heard that you're leaving tomorrow.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,870
You're abandoning the election and your son?

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,490
That bald fool!

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,370
Why did he tell her?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,160
Why don't you stay and see this through?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,060
We already know the election's outcome.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,060
I've had my fun.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,860
Meeting that Leorio guy was the best part.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,380
He shows a lot of promise.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,960
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,300
We're down to four candidates.
We don't know the outcome.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,270
That's what I'm saying.
See? You do understand.

15
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,980
Approval x And x Coalition

16
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,860
I plan on voting for you today.

17
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,540
See ya around.

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,860
What in the world are you talking about?

19
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,370
Are you stupid?

20
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm saying the outcome will be
that there is no outcome!

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,620
Want to know how many days
it'll be before this is over?

22
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,130
How can you possibly know that?

23
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,540
Because you and Mizai are in this to win.

24
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,870
But if you really wanted to win,
you should have tried harder before.

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,550
You needed to use any means necessary

26
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,750
during the second or third
votes to secure a majority,

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,020
and clear the turnout requirement.

28
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,190
Why are you telling me this now?

29
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,350
It's easy to say whatever you want in hindsight.

30
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,350
If I'd warned you beforehand,
you'd have done the opposite.

31
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,030
You're so difficult!

32
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,540
Well, I don't care if you think
this is hindsight speaking.

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,160
You can tell yourself that until the day this ends.

34
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,430
Wait!

35
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,200
What do you want?

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,920
I'll do as you say.

37
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,120
What should I do?

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,670
You don't sound too happy about it.

39
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,770
I don't know what Pariston is thinking.

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,480
How do I beat him?

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,820
Except you've never done anything
I've told you to do...

42
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,990
Okay, I'll start with what Pariston's thinking, then.

43
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,450
He doesn't want to win.

44
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,160
But he doesn't want to lose, either.

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,530
That's what makes him strong.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,060
What? How can that be?

47
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,790
Yeah, I know.

48
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,290
Common sense tells you that people
who want to win are stronger, right?

49
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,930
Nothing wrong with that. You're right.

50
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,180
And being right makes you predictable.

51
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,170
That goes especially for when you want to win

52
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,560
a game where you're trying to secure votes.

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,190
Game?

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,780
See? You thought I was being disrespectful, right?

55
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,200
You're mad because you're big on morals,
balance, and sticking to the manual.

56
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,970
Look at me.

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,320
You're failing to act like a dog.

58
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,200
You're just being yourself.

59
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,200
Pariston is familiar with both sides
of you, so he knows that.

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,720
He knows exactly what you're
thinking and what you'll do next.

61
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,630
And even then, he doesn't want to win.

62
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,970
He's damn good, right?

63
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,310
Then what do I do?

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,880
I told you...

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,810
If I tell you what to do, you'll never listen.

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,480
How many times must we go through this?

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,990
Okay, I'll tell you what happens
if the game continues as is.

68
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,490
First, you and Pariston will be the ones
remaining after the next vote.

69
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,620
In the two-candidate vote after
that, first and second will flip.

70
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,250
And that's what will keep happening.

71
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,750
Pariston will probably try
to lower the turnout rate.

72
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,510
The Association Hunters he has
control over will refuse to vote.

73
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,040
Why?

74
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,680
Like I said...

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,130
He doesn't want to win or lose.

76
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,770
He'll drag things out until the very last day.

77
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,840
He's just looking to have fun.

78
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,170
He's like Netero and me.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,150
Well, I get bored a lot more quickly...

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,900
But he has more patience.

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,280
Of the four remaining candidates,
Pariston is the only one

82
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,160
who carries on Netero's will.

83
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,410
You have no right to say that!

84
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
You're only jealous of him.

85
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,670
Were you that fond of the dirty old man?

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,300
Shut your mouth!

87
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
Don't get too full of yourself!

88
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,310
You just have to tell me the day
when this election will end,

89
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,310
you stupid vagabond!

90
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,810
Okay, I can do that...

91
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,760
But before this is over, you
should learn to act in character.

92
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,130
You're impossible to talk to.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,130
The day Netero blew himself up,

94
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,550
one hundred large airships belonging
to the Hunter Association

95
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,450
set off for East Gorteau.

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,800
There's no record of their departure.

97
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,580
All records show that they're
in hangars for maintenance.

98
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,440
You had no idea, did you?

99
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,710
You should make friends with
some mechanics and pilots.

100
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,150
What are you talking about?

101
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,710
They're recovering approximately
five thousand cocoons.

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,120
Cocoons containing chimera mutants.

103
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,580
They all have the ability to use Nen.

104
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,780
And they're all probably about to hatch.

105
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,400
Pariston plans to have some fun with them,

106
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,360
now that he has such a huge playground.

107
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,610
The day the election ends will be
the day of the next Hunter Exam.

108
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,840
However, if the Commandments are reformed,

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,120
the situation will change slightly.

110
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,200
You'll have to figure out the rest yourself.

111
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,910
Aren't you a Hunter?

112
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,680
Okay, we will now hold the eighth vote
for the election of the 13th chairman.

113
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,520
Today, we will start by listening to speeches
from the four remaining candidates.

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,780
After some debate among the candidates,
we will move on to the vote.

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,030
How did this happen?

116
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, I guess it's my fault...

117
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,460
Now, first,

118
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,840
we have comments from the
candidates who did not qualify.

119
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,040
First, I would like to thank everyone
who supported me. Thank you.

120
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,250
And if possible,

121
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,300
going forward, I would ask those who had
faith in me to give your votes to Cheadle.

122
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,090
The Zodiacs are not united.

123
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,700
However, there are those among
us who share very similar goals.

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,560
And the one who shares my goal is Cheadle.

125
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,470
Her desire to maintain balance will lead
the Association in a better direction.

126
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,370
Where you people are now is not
my reality, so do what you want.

127
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,330
Ging!! Don't try to run while you're
ahead!! Get back here!!

128
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,390
We will now begin the speeches
from the candidates.

129
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,720
There is one thing to note.

130
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,220
Everyone who's gathered inside the hall today

131
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:04,480
will be asked to stay until the 13th
chairman has been selected.

132
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,880
Anyone inside?

133
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,030
Only Tsubone and Canary.

134
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,760
How's Master Alluka?

135
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,570
She's still asleep.

136
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,290
I'm waiting for her to wake up.

137
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,790
It won't be much longer.

138
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Just a little longer, Gon!

139
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,200
It's possible that we will
continue to have multiple ties,

140
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,620
but we've arranged for all necessary provisions,

141
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,760
so you can rest easy repeating the vote as
many times as necessary, be it for hours or days.

142
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,840
Let me repeat myself.

143
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,090
You may not leave this hall until the
13th chairman has been selected.

144
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,540
Now, we'll start with a speech from
the candidate in fourth, Mizaistom.

145
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,560
This is bad.

146
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,990
To eliminate Pariston, I will
serve as a sacrificial lamb.

147
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,210
I'll make this quick.

148
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,480
Of the four candidates on stage,

149
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,870
I believe the one most qualified to be chairman

150
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,620
is Cheadle.

151
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,770
I won't say that I'm not willing
to become chairman.

152
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,590
But it isn't my time.

153
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,270
First, I must train the Hunters under me,

154
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,010
and work to become a Triple Hunter.

155
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:51,020
I would appreciate it if you'd respect my
wishes, and help end this election today.

156
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,000
That's all I have to say.

157
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,520
What should I say?

158
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,400
Next, we have the candidate
in third, Cheadle-san.

159
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,690
All yours.

160
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,550
I'll also make this quick.

161
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,290
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the 13th chairman

162
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,830
should be Leorio.

163
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,420
That's all I have to say.

164
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,600
What is Cheadle up to?

165
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,030
I'm not gonna be elected.

166
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,680
I don't even want to be elected.

167
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,570
But I guess I should say what I want.

168
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,300
My focus right now isn't this election, anyway.

169
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,320
Okay... Thank you.

170
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,220
Next, we have the candidate
in second, Leorio-san.

171
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,340
All yours.

172
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,950
You aren't smiling anymore, Pariston.

173
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,710
I won't let you have your way!

174
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,200
Huh?

175
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,160
Leorio-san, could you please speak?

176
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,820
Leorio-san!

177
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,870
Damn it, Leorio!

178
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,600
Are you asleep?

179
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
I'll strangle you!

180
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,290
Ah! Me?

181
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,390
Nope, I'm drawing a blank.

182
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,740
What am I doing up here?

183
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,800
Forget it.

184
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,490
In that case...

185
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,120
I'll just say what's on my mind.

186
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,260
If elected chairman, I'll treat the
Association like it belongs to me!

187
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:53,770
My first command will be to order
all of you to help save Gon!

188
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,740
This isn't where I should be right now.

189
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:09,160
Well, it isn't like I could help
Gon if I were with him...

190
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,410
He's... Gon is fighting for his life now.

191
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,320
He's a buddy. A friend.

192
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,300
But I only found out recently.

193
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,740
While I was studying for myself,

194
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,290
drinking, moving from place to place,

195
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,520
jerking off, entertaining women,

196
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,440
and surfing the Internet...

197
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,070
He was fighting for others.

198
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,130
Alongside the former chairman and their allies.

199
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,740
One of them has put his life
on the line to save Gon.

200
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,680
All I could do was talk to Gon.

201
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,460
That's all I can do.

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,240
So if I become chairman,
I won't stop talking to you.

203
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,360
Please help save Gon!

204
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,130
Use your heads!

205
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,750
If you have an idea, take action!

206
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,240
If there's something I can do, tell me.

207
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,550
I'll do anything!

208
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,360
Ging...

209
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,870
I think I understand why you
didn't avoid his punch.

210
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,250
Even from that moment,
you saw something in him.

211
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm fine with having him as chairman.

212
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,280
Damn, I think I said more than I needed to.

213
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Forget the part about jerking off.

214
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,620
I'm done.

215
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,330
If we're there to support him,

216
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,460
I'm sure he'll make a good chairman.

217
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,900
Finally, we have the candidate
in first place, Pariston-san.

218
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,150
All yours.

219
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,380
Everyone, please be quiet!

220
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,080
It's over, Pariston.

221
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,880
It doesn't matter what you say.

222
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,390
My eighty-seven votes,
Mizai's seventy-two votes,

223
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,270
and the fifty-seven independent votes

224
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,020
will be added to Leorio's ninety-five.

225
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,100
That gives him three hundred, eleven votes.

226
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,400
He'll have over fifty percent of the vote.

227
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,400
The 13th chairman will be Leorio.

228
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,080
Everyone, please quiet down.

229
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,910
Refrain from using mobile phones.

230
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,540
Um, in a moment, I'm going to get loud.

231
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,850
Everyone, you can continue
talking on the phone.

232
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,340
This is the true Hunter spirit.

233
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,240
Once this election ends, I promise to
do everything I can to help Gon-kun.

234
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,070
However, we must keep that matter
separate from the election.

235
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,190
Of the remaining candidates,
the one most qualified to be chairman

236
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,190
is Mizaistom-san.

237
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:44,460
Heart Is Valuable

238
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,520
There's something I've learned

239
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,710
after serving as Chairman Netero's
Vice Chairman for three years.

240
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,460
There are three conditions a chairman needs.

241
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,960
First is combat ability.

242
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,330
This is an absolute necessity,
given our job requirements.

243
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,710
During the recent crisis, this was evident.

244
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,220
Second is experience.

245
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,460
Wisdom comes from experience!

246
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,850
As a Hunter, you can never have
too many years of experience.

247
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,850
Why?

248
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,110
Why do I feel so irritated when he's talking?

249
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,850
And the third is caliber.

250
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,240
I know why...

251
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,520
I understand him.

252
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,240
He never says what he truly thinks.

253
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,320
There aren't too many people who make you think

254
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,290
that the Association would be in good
hands if they were chairman.

255
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,780
Cheadle lacks combat ability.

256
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,750
Leorio-san lacks experience.

257
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,630
Stop... Don't let emotions get the best of me.

258
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,170
And I lack all three!

259
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,670
Hey, you were supposed to laugh.

260
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,140
I need to figure out what he's after.

261
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,650
I believe that Mizaistom-san is the only
one possessing all three qualities.

262
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,910
One hundred and twenty of Pariston's two
hundred ninety are Association Hunters.

263
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,750
Thirty of the votes come from

264
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,010
the investigative and administrative
departments he heads.

265
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,860
Pariston is able to control those votes

266
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,920
as he likes without any signs or speeches.

267
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,200
We will now move on to the
debate among the candidates.

268
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,500
Pariston's speech will create a split

269
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,300
among the independents, who were all
most likely leaning toward Leorio.

270
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm guessing this is how it will look.

271
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:39,190
Leorio: Leorio votes, Cheadle votes, Morel votes, Teradein votes
Pariston: Association Hunter and Administrative
Department votes, Pariston personal votes
Mizaistom: Mizai votes, Pariston votes
Cheadle: Mizai votes

272
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,760
But that would just push the
election out another vote,

273
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,700
which matches our goal.

274
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Will something change during the debate?

275
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,210
Fine, then... I'll figure this out myself!

276
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,030
Can I go first, then?

277
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,090
No, I go first.

278
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,470
As I said earlier, I'm not interested
in becoming chairman.

279
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,770
No, you said that you wouldn't say
you're not willing to become chairman.

280
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,580
However, this isn't about what you want, Mizai-san.

281
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,570
What matters is how the voters feel.

282
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,830
Sometimes, there are situations where a job
can only be done by a certain person.

283
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,500
That's where caliber comes in.

284
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,960
You shouldn't be talking about how you feel.

285
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,650
Stop the petty tricks, and let the voters decide.

286
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,300
You have the nerve to say that?

287
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,980
But why is he pushing Mizai?

288
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,280
Does he expect us

289
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,880
to let greed get the better of
us and push Mizai to second?

290
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,920
That will never happen!

291
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,890
Because the votes for Leorio
are primarily independent.

292
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,870
If Leorio loses, they're likely to swing to Pariston.

293
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,770
But if Leorio remains,

294
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,630
the votes previously cast for myself
and the openly anti-Pariston Mizai

295
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,150
will go to Leorio.

296
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,090
He'll hold on to Teradein's anti-Zodiac votes,

297
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,850
and the Morel votes are also anti-Pariston.

298
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,510
Meaning that they'll never switch to Pariston.

299
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,040
Got it, Mizai?

300
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,780
Yeah, I understand.

301
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,610
Defeating Pariston is the ultimate goal.

302
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,330
As a Crime Hunter, I trust my instinct.

303
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,660
There's no proof, and it's entirely possible
that his hands are clean.

304
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,060
However...

305
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,710
He definitely has underground ties.

306
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,020
We can't let him run rampant within
the Association any longer.

307
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,300
Since it appears that not even
Netero could rein him in...

308
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,330
This election is where we must...

309
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,580
...tear down Pariston's system.

310
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,860
And so, the eighth vote for
the 13th chairman begins.

311
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,130
The votes fly.

312
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,450
Is he defeated?

313
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,890
As Killua takes Something's hand,
everything approaches its end.

314
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,940
Next time: Defeat x And x Reunion.
