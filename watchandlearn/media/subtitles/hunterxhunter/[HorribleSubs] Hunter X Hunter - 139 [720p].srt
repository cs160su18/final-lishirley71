2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,250
While Killua was returning to the Zoldyck
compound for a reunion with Alluka,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,010
who was locked up deep underground...

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,250
I'd say there were six other cases
in which two people died...

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,470
Our mother didn't believe Killua,
so that was another pair.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
Another pair died to satisfy her curiosity.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,940
After verification,

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,010
she sacrificed two more pairs to learn
how the other victims were chosen.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,370
Then Milluki

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,140
exchanged the lives of two pairs
of tourists for some cheap toys.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,370
During that time, there were two major incidents.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,730
There were thirteen deaths in the first, and sixty seven in the second.

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,150
Kill him for me.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,410
Milluki was responsible for the first one.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,460
Can you make me a millionaire?

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,670
Yasuha, the butler, was
responsible for the second.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alluka x And x Something

18
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,810
Sure, a few pictures are no big deal, Muna-san.

19
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm just taking Alluka and Kalluto for a walk.

20
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,290
Oh, they're my younger brothers.

21
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,740
Incredible!

22
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey, Muna...

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,590
Eat this.

24
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,040
Huh?

25
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,480
Hmm?

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, sorry...

27
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,960
He likes to make requests.

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,910
You only need to refuse.

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,760
Kill him for me.

30
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,150
Figuring out the tourist incident was harder...

31
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,820
But since another butler paid the
price for the second incident,

32
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,200
it was easy to track down the victims.

33
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,640
After investigation, I realized something.

34
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,400
The criteria that determines who dies

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,520
is different for more than two people.

36
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,540
Perhaps there are different rules for when a pair dies,

37
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,090
and when many people die.

38
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,520
Zoldyck butlers are trained in
a facility on our property.

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,610
At the exact moment Kasuga died,

40
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,060
every butler in her class at that
facility was wrung to death.

41
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,190
A number of her teachers also died.

42
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,760
Butlers from other classes...

43
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,780
Friends from her orphanage...

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Her foster parents and their parents...

45
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,130
All people she was close to.

46
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,640
Still, that she liked all of her
classmates was impossible, right?

47
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,890
It becomes clear when you look at her
hospitalized biological mother.

48
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,670
Every month, she could only meet
her mother for half an hour.

49
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,620
Records from Kasuga's student days say she
loved her mother most in the world.

50
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,330
But her mother, in the hospital, survived.

51
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,050
Well, people change...

52
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,800
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.

53
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,260
I agree, but that wasn't the case here.

54
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,630
It wasn't that she began to hate her mother.

55
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,450
Rather, she found someone she loved more.

56
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,560
Kasuga had just begun a relationship.

57
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,500
She had spent even less time with her lover
than she did with her mother.

58
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,420
Hold on...

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
You did not investigate her past afterward.

60
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,820
After learning her past, you chose her to test.

61
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,570
Oh, you could tell?

62
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,580
Yeah, that's right.

63
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,060
We used her to confirm our suspicions.

64
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,460
Since our butlers aren't allowed
to have relationships, or they're killed.

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,880
The first incident made it clear
that this power was dangerous.

66
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,310
Capable of destroying the Zoldyck
family, if we didn't understand it.

67
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,500
After investigating and drawing
conclusions from the first incident,

68
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,580
we verified our findings with the second incident.

69
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,370
If you fail to grant four of Alluka's requests,

70
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,350
you must pay with your life.

71
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,370
When the price is two lives,

72
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,250
you and the person you love most will die.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,370
When more than two must be sacrificed,

74
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,880
you and the person you love most will die.

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,730
Followed by, in order, those you've
spent the most time with.

76
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,310
So Kasuga's mother didn't die because she
didn't spend enough time with her.

77
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,540
And Kasuga's lover died,
despite his short time with her.

78
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,110
This is a problem.

79
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,600
Isn't it?

80
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,340
Killua will make a wish to Alluka, to restore Gon.

81
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,490
If Killua makes the wish

82
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,000
and lets someone else fulfill the requests,

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,620
there won't be any problem.

84
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,280
But I'm sure Killua will do things
the other way around.

85
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Brother!

86
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,680
Alluka...

87
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,290
Killua will have someone else make the wish,

88
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,180
and will then attempt to fulfill the consequent requests.

89
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,470
Sorry about leaving you down
here for so long, Alluka.

90
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,550
It's okay! I'm really happy!

92
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,550
I've missed your scent...

93
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,300
The leader of the monsters was
strong enough to force Netero

94
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,230
to resort to the Rose.

95
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,970
To defeat one of its subordinates,

96
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,680
Gon's restriction and covenant must
have been worse than death.

97
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,680
Restriction                                                                      Covenant

98
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:25,130
Money and medical science cannot
do anything to reverse that.

99
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,280
The wish will be granted.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,070
And then, Killua will do whatever
he can to fulfill Alluka's requests.

101
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Killua will receive requests he cannot fulfill.

102
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,290
However, Killua will try his best,
and fail halfway.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,830
Mission failed.

104
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,590
Since the price is the one he loves most

105
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,340
and those he's spent most time with,

106
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,600
the restored Gon will die, either way.

107
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Huh?

108
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,660
Huh?

109
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,520
Oh.

110
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,600
Am I wrong?

111
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,160
When you mentioned that two would suffer,

112
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,130
you did not mean Killua and Gon.

113
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,860
You were referring to Killua and yourself?

114
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,370
Yes, that's right.

115
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,370
I have issues, but you are just as bad.

116
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,960
And if things go wrong,

117
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,580
it won't only be Killua, Gon, and me.

118
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,510
Every Zoldyck will die.

119
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,330
I'm thinking that this wish will require
tens of thousands of lives.

120
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,750
So you'll probably die, too.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,020
That's why your reaction surprised me.

122
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,030
Oh, this is a problem...

123
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,040
Brother, die.

124
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,090
Okay, sure.

125
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,550
Bang!

126
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,500
I'll ask Killua
to follow proper procedure when he makes his wish.

127
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,010
I want you there, hidden.

128
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,750
If Killua either refuses, or agrees, but you feel he's lying,

129
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,280
I want you to dispose of Alluka.

130
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,880
He has no combat abilities.

131
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,610
You can consider him an ordinary child.

132
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,460
However, we don't know where he came from.

133
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,880
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 258 (39%)
2) Cheadle — 49
3) Botobai — 31
4) Ickshonpe — 28
5) Mizaistom — 27

134
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,300
6) Morel — 18
7) Teradein — 17
8) Saccho — 15
9) Sanbica, Bushidora — 14
11) Loupe — 11
12) Cutie, Biscuit, Linne — 10
15) Tsezguerra — 9
16) Knov, Kanzai — 6
18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, 6 others — 3
27) Saiyu, 3 others — 2
31) Gon, Hanzo, 21 others — 1

135
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,660
There were 68 absentees.

136
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,800
Absentees — 68              Turnout — 89.7%

137
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,800
The turnout was 89.7%.

138
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,370
Oh, dear... Oh, dear... Oh, dear.

139
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,310
This is strange.

140
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,260
In the second vote, there were
thirty-three absentees.

141
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,840
This time, we have sixty-eight absentees.

142
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,940
More Hunters were absent.

143
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,390
Is this because they previously
submitted invalid votes,

144
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,460
which is no longer possible?

145
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,450
So they chose to put their
licenses on the line by not voting at all?

146
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,240
What's going on?

147
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,460
Why would they do that?!

148
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,080
Is it okay if we take licenses

149
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,960
from anyone who's committed both offenses?

150
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,380
Yes, I suppose we have no choice.

151
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,220
Cluck-san, this is the list.

152
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,920
Please send them a letter that says these two things:

153
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,080
They must bring their licenses to headquarters.

154
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,270
And that we expect them to explain their absences.

155
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,420
Hold on...

156
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,240
Is this really the correct course of action?

157
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,790
Violators can break the rules with impunity
if they're willing to give up their license.

158
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,630
They no longer need to fear
the penalty for not voting.

159
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,880
Taking away their licenses was your idea!

160
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,900
Huh? But we put the proposal to a vote.

161
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,480
Besides, everyone was against the idea

162
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,140
of temporarily stripping them of Hunter status.

163
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,930
If my goal had been to quickly improve turnout,

164
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,650
I would have pushed harder.

165
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,750
Yes, he's hard to deal with

166
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,460
because he readily accepts
suggestions that hurt him.

167
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,660
And he'll even propose ideas detrimental to him.

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,310
It's as though he enjoys the obstacles.

169
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,310
That's the one aspect that's
similar to Chairman Netero.

170
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,570
And I don't like it!

171
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,970
So I have a proposal.

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,010
I think the twelve Zodiacs should give a speech

173
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,470
before all of the Hunters.

174
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,180
We must express this election's importance!

175
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,690
For the Association...

176
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,130
For humanity...

177
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,000
For the world!

178
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,290
Speaking through a screen is no good.

179
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,160
We must look each of them in the eye,

180
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,010
and let them hear our voices,
and feel our souls in person.

181
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,660
For the sake of the former chairman!

182
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,150
This is why

183
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,500
I hate your guts, Pariston!

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,510
Brother, wake up!

185
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,120
Boo!

186
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,400
You're so good!

187
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,020
Alluka's power has rules the rest of
the family doesn't know about.

188
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,440
Brother, let's play shiritori.

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,910
Okay, sure.

190
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,030
Then...

191
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,120
I'll start with the ending "A" in "Alluka"!

192
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,840
When Alluka calls me "Brother,"
she's the real Alluka.

193
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,520
The Alluka that calls me "Killua"

194
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
is something else.

195
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,560
Brother, pat my head.

196
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,970
Sure.

197
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,130
Killua's being a model big brother.

198
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,500
That's three requests down.

199
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,190
A computer isn't a big deal.

200
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,790
S-S-Sorry, Papa...

201
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,480
I won't do it again!

202
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,490
That means Alluka is ready.

203
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,480
Yep, Killua just has to make his wish.

204
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,290
Milluki, I want you to go over the rules again.

205
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,750
Ah, sure.

206
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm aware of five rules.

207
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,250
One.

208
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,460
When one of Alluka's requests is not
fulfilled, and a price is paid,

209
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,850
the request difficulty is reset to level 1.

210
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,750
That's the best time to make a wish to Alluka.

211
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,800
Two.

212
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,830
Once Alluka starts making requests to someone,

213
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,830
he will never switch his requests
to someone different.

214
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,850
That's why I always ensured
that Alluka made a request

215
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,660
to a butler before sending
him to you and Mama.

216
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,280
I'd guess Killua did the same thing.

217
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,750
That's why Alluka has never made
any requests of you two.

218
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,760
Three.

219
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,340
If the person fulfilling requests
dies before finishing the job,

220
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,300
it's considered a failure,

221
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,120
and at least one more will die.

222
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,400
This was confirmed by experiment.

223
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,110
Four.

224
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,310
If he doesn't know someone's name,
Alluka can't make requests of them.

225
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,940
Five.

226
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,940
The same person can't make two wishes in a row.

227
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,470
That's all I know.

228
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,630
I'm not hiding anything from you!

229
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,230
I swear on the deal we made.

230
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,210
Why isn't Killua making a wish?

231
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,210
He probably has some foolish idea...

232
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,330
If Killua makes a wish now,

233
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,720
someone else will have to clean up the mess.

234
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
That makes no sense at all.

235
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,490
He can save his friend first,

236
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,730
and worry about the consequences later.

237
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,790
Papa...

238
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,280
Would his friend be happy to know

239
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,210
that many lives were sacrificed to save him?

240
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,490
No!

241
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,530
That's what's going through his head.

242
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,990
Since he's stupid.

243
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,420
His mind doesn't work the way ours do.

244
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,000
That's why you had Illu-nii use
his needles on him, right?

245
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,690
He's moving.

246
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,690
Father, open the door.

247
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,440
No.

248
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,530
Make the wish in that room.

249
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,410
We cannot let you go outside.

250
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,000
As I thought.

251
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,540
They don't know about any of these rules.

252
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,670
Father,

253
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,880
I am definitely your son.

254
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,560
You said Alluka was something that
came from somewhere else.

255
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,760
Right?

256
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,600
I call the black-eyed Alluka "Something."

257
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,610
We're leaving.

258
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,230
I'll clean up my own mess.

259
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,330
Something,

260
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,310
if we haven't left the mountain in half an hour,

261
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,840
kill my mother!

262
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,850
Huh? Hey, Killua!

263
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,850
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,

264
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,220
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.

265
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,970
Got it?

266
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,860
'Kay.

267
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,370
Mama!

268
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,960
Killua...

269
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,890
How...

270
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,390
How can you issue such cruel commands?

271
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,060
It's magnificent! You've grown up!

272
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,390
Damn! You're allowed to do that?

273
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,400
As long as only one wish is granted,

274
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,770
you can give yourself options!

275
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,350
Father,

276
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,480
open the door.

277
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,230
Something is skilled at breaking,
but not as skilled at fixing.

278
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,760
When she's fixing,

279
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,110
Something must touch the target.

280
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,070
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,

281
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.

282
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm going to save both Gon and Alluka!

283
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,010
Killua's determination to save Gon
has set events in motion.

284
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,760
And that man returns.

285
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,070
