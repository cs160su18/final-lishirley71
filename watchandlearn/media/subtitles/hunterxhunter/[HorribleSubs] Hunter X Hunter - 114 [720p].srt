2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,560
That's Morel's Smoky Jail...

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,520
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,990
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,880
the King and Pitou aren't there.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,220
Where are they?

7
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,030
Divide x And x Conquer

8
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,810
Each has begun his own battle

9
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,300
in his own respective location.

10
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,970
Gon...

11
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,780
Grandpa!

12
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,540
Which means that that's...

13
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,810
the King!

14
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,300
Proceed.

15
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,170
I am fully aware that you seek
to accomplish your objective

16
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,310
with minimal human casualties.

17
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,850
You took advantage of the chaos in the palace

18
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,320
in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.

19
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,180
It makes no difference.

20
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,330
Proceed.

21
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,940
Dragon Head!

22
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,530
He is frightening...

23
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,100
The technique he unleashed was
not intended to hurt the King.

24
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,530
And both of them could tell that the King

25
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,250
realized this at once.

26
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,480
Zeno made certain that his Nen
was completely neutral.

27
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...

28
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Killua...

29
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,140
Pitou is over there.

30
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,170
Let's go!

31
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,700
Let's go...

32
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,640
In what sense did you mean that?

33
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,530
Killua barely managed to stop himself
from asking the question.

34
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,100
If I ask that question,

35
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,160
I won't be able to stop anymore...

36
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,010
I won't be able to go back.

37
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,050
If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer.

38
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,980
Anyone with enough experience
would easily arrive at that next step.

39
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,060
But the fear of losing someone he cared for

40
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,290
prevented him from taking that step.

41
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,270
A few moments before the dragon took flight,

42
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,830
Cheetu and Brovada appeared

43
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,540
before Ikalgo.

44
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,590
Hey, it's Flutter.

45
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,520
What's with all the noise?

46
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,850
Pitou-dono's En disappeared again.

47
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,040
I just returned...

48
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,350
It seems the enemy is attacking.

49
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,720
Seriously?

50
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,510
Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this.

51
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,040
What happened to your wings?

52
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh, uh...

53
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,080
I lost them earlier, during the attack.

54
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,090
Are you going underground?

55
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,340
Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama.

56
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,790
What should we do?

57
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,560
Well, we weren't told to defend this place...

58
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,590
But I'm just itching to try

59
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,770
my new technique.

60
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,220
It's huge...

61
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,120
That looks fun!

62
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,900
I'm gonna check it out!

63
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,630
Be careful!

64
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm gonna see what's going on!

65
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,310
Then, I'll be going.

66
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,130
Okay.

67
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,150
"Hagya-sama"?

68
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,910
Meanwhile, in the throne room,
in the central tower...

69
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,040
Is it truly possible

70
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,680
to trap me in one place?

71
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,810
Why don't we find out?

72
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,820
Wing scales...

73
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,820
Knov said that they can hypnotize people.

74
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,500
I don't want to inhale any...

75
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,450
You seem to be finished talking.

76
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,980
I would expect that of anyone
with considerable power.

77
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,330
However...

78
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,520
Caution, resolve,

79
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,100
and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio.

80
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,250
His caution isn't as strong
because he's confident.

81
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,860
It's safe to say he has a strong personality.

82
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,310
Pouf's Spiritual Message

83
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:47,250
surrounds his opponent with wing scales,
making their aura more opaque,

84
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,260
letting him sense their state of mind.

85
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,010
I suppose I should introduce myself.

86
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,960
I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard.

87
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,400
His caution has increased slightly.

88
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,280
You won't tell me your name?

89
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,430
If you believe that I'm trying

90
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:31,910
to trick you into inhaling my wing
scales, you're sadly mistaken.

91
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,910
And to be honest, I'm a little shocked.

92
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,940
After a rebirth, all will be forgotten.

93
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,930
I'll need you to wait a moment.

94
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,150
If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me.

95
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,510
No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...

96
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,860
Shoot was fighting recklessly,
without concern for his life,

97
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,460
which turned out to be the
reason he was still alive.

98
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,090
Hotel Rafflesia...

99
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,150
While barely dodging multiple attacks that
would have been otherwise lethal,

100
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:17,390
Shoot had only managed to take
the eye on Youpi's shoulder.

101
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,280
He had essentially done no damage.

102
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
However...

103
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,750
Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.

104
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,830
The strange sensation that his momentum
was being stolen, rather than stopped,

105
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,250
influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously.

106
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,000
After taking multiple hits from
attacks he didn't understand,

107
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,760
Youpi was backing up.

108
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,770
I can't let this guy near the King.

109
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,150
Every second I keep him away
from the King counts.

110
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,280
Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.

111
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,260
However, this expected turn of events

112
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,040
was difficult on Knuckle...

113
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,700
Hold it in...

114
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,290
I can't attack now!

115
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,230
If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting

116
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,550
that there's one more enemy
he needs to worry about!

117
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,060
Hold it in!

118
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,140
Shoot was now covered in blood,

119
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,570
as he endured Youpi's ferocious
barrage of attacks.

120
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,230
Forced to watch from the sidelines,

121
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,100
just remaining hidden was a battle.

122
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,580
No matter how he told himself to keep still...

123
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,800
Hold it in... Please hold it in!

124
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,810
Knuckle was unable to hold back the
tears streaming down his face.

125
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,100
You can do it!

126
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,300
It's time.

127
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,810
Adding interest.

128
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,110
Only ten seconds have passed?

129
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,740
You're kidding!

130
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,790
How much longer do I have to endure
this suffocating, excruciating wait

131
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,720
that makes me want to do nothing but run away?

132
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
This must be some kind of joke...

133
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,180
And it isn't funny!

134
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,770
I can't hold it in any longer!

135
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,320
Knuckle's rampage was halted

136
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,660
by the first tap from Meleoron.

137
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,080
Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!

138
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,420
But that just might have saved me.

139
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,490
Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.

140
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,870
He, too, had reached his limit.

141
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Crap!

142
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,370
Uh-oh.

143
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,880
He barely scratched me, but it
was enough damage

144
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,580
to offset the interest and
my full-strength attack.

145
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,130
Shoot is risking his life out there,

146
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,840
while I'm standing here unhurt,
and making stupid mistakes!

147
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,560
Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,

148
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,460
nor did he notice APR's declaration
of returned interest.

149
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,470
Damn!

150
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,550
He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either.

151
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,820
Calm down, you fool...

152
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,980
You're gonna ruin everything.

153
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,480
Here's the distance where we want to stay...

154
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Not close enough for him to find us,
but close enough to get in fast.

155
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,990
He'll notice APR for a second,
but that's no problem.

156
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,990
Shoot's fighting hard,

157
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,250
so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron.

158
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,160
God's Accomplice...

159
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,170
Undo.

160
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,790
What is this thing?

161
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,390
When did it show up?

162
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,220
No, it can't be that I didn't notice it.

163
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,900
It just suddenly appeared.

164
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,300
Was I hit by an attack?

165
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
No, I wasn't.

166
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,450
A delayed effect?

167
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,530
So it must have been then!

168
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,330
Does that mean the condition
was met during the fight?

169
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,880
What is this number?

170
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,250
Is it a countdown? A bomb?

171
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,150
No, the number isn't going up or down.

172
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,260
This is too much of a pain!

173
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,270
I only need to destroy the source!

174
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,510
Something's coming.

175
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,280
Despite his overwhelming power,

176
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,200
one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot

177
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
was the evident difference in
skill level between them.

178
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,220
It's fast... I can't get away!

179
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,050
One skewered chuck of meat coming up!

180
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,090
He hit himself to accelerate.

181
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,140
Very well...

182
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,790
That was close.

183
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,360
The reaction to the attack told Youpi
that he could win at any moment.

184
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,460
Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,

185
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,940
so this spurred him on.

186
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,600
Youpi's analysis was on the mark.

187
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,030
It was true that Youpi was
increasingly likely to win this fight.

188
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,180
If he made any mistake, it was not realizing

189
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,170
that Shoot was fine with this fact.

190
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,390
I can keep going...

191
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,930
I...

192
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,560
can still fly.

193
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,010
I'm not done...

194
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,310
However, quietly and surely...

195
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,010
Shoot was reaching his limit.

196
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,690
Hey, Youpi!

197
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,330
Over here, fool!

198
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,690
Knuckle!

199
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?

200
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,980
That's fine.

201
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,230
That will serve to distract Youpi,

202
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,110
and it will save Shoot.

203
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,770
Bring it!

204
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,570
After calming down and regaining composure,

205
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,380
Knuckle decided to show himself.

206
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,150
Next time: Duty x And x Question.

207
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,050
Huh? Where are you, Gon?

208
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,430
Over here.

209
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,420
Gon! Wait, you disappeared again!

210
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,360
Perfect Plan... Undo!

211
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm always by your side.
