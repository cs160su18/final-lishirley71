2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,020
This is it.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,450
My brother sent the URL.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,200
Great!

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
Let's get started.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,510
Yeah!

7
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,040
Gathering x Of x Heroes

8
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,420
As Kurapika obtains his ticket

9
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,270
to face the Phantom Troupe
and avenge the Kurta,

10
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,610
Gon and Killua also prepare for the auction

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,820
in Yorknew City.

12
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,270
This is the website for Hunters?

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,910
Yeah, I've heard that Hunters
worldwide post information here.

14
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,750
Worldwide?

15
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,030
Wow...

16
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,740
Please swipe your Hunter License,

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,320
and enter your license code.

18
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,030
Put the cursor on the bartender.

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,210
What kind of information would you like?

20
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,080
Wow! There's so much!

21
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,750
Select the game category.

22
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,530
There it is.

23
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,780
Greed Island.

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,320
It will cost twenty million Jenny.

25
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,060
Twenty million...

26
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,780
So they won't give out the
information for free.

27
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, we don't really have a choice.

28
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,950
Deposit twenty million...

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,350
I can feel aura coming from the monitor!

30
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,780
I guess only Nen users can enter this site.

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,220
Okay,

32
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,380
now listen carefully.

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,470
Greed Island is

34
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,480
a game created by Nen practitioners.

35
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,190
Apparently, there were multiple creators,

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,290
but no one knows their objective.

37
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,740
They put Nen into all hundred
copies of the game.

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,130
When you start the game,
the Nen activates,

39
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,490
pulling the player inside the game.

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,380
Inside the game?

41
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Only Nen practitioners can play the game.

42
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,880
And as long as the player stays
alive within the game,

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
it will continue to run,

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,230
even if the console is unplugged.

45
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,700
It will stop if the player dies.

46
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,140
One person who owned the game

47
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,890
hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot,

48
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,200
but none of them ever came back.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,650
I hear that you can return
if you find a save point.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
Is that true?

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,120
This information is from
the Hunter website.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,650
It's gotta be accurate.

53
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,410
At the Yorknew City auction,

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,410
seven copies of Greed Island
will be up for sale.

55
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,790
The lowest starting bid is 8.9 billion Jenny.

56
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,100
8.9 billion?!

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,990
The price has shot up!

58
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,420
That's 3 billion more than the retail price!

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,300
Difficulty of obtainment is G-rank.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,370
Huh?

61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,580
The game is considered a legend,

62
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,600
but there are plenty of copies.

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,310
If you have enough money,
it's relatively easy to procure.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,290
Hmm, a G...

65
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,810
Lower than I expected.

66
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,070
The message is that if I can't
even get a simple game,

67
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,820
I'll never be able to find you,

68
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,130
Ging.

69
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,830
Still, the money is a big problem.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,970
Hey, can we participate in the auction?

71
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,110
They're starting at 8.9 billion!

72
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,280
That's out of our league.

73
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,770
No, I mean by selling stuff.

74
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,990
Selling?

75
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,850
That's it!

76
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,600
We can look for treasure,
and then auction it off.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,730
Okay!

78
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,400
We can start with the 800 million we earned

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,360
at Heavens Arena, and go from there.

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,610
Yep!

81
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,970
First, we'll start with online flea
markets and auction websites.

82
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,860
And see

83
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,990
what we can dig up.

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,370
We'll increase our money,
and get ourselves a copy of Greed Island !

85
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,250
Yeah!

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,560
Yay!

87
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,070
How much do we have left?

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,860
Combined, we're at 10.84 million.

89
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,750
Damn...

90
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,540
Initially, we were making a profit.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,640
That's why I said we should only
use trustworthy public sites.

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,190
I couldn't help it!

93
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,120
Only the risky sites are profitable.

94
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,080
It isn't working...

95
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,810
Now, show me what you've brought.

96
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,300
The hair of the famous actress Sara,

97
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,310
and a DNA test to validate authenticity.

98
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,320
The right arm of an Egyptian mummy,
taken directly from a pyramid.

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,570
The scaly skin of an ichthyosis patient.

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,330
The skull of a one-horned creature.

101
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,460
Okay, all four of you are hired.

102
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,710
I'm Dalzollene, the head bodyguard.

103
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,330
It's a pleasure.

104
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,710
I'll need you to start working immediately.

105
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,470
Your mission is to escort the boss
to a Yorknew City hotel room.

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,970
A private aircraft will take you to
Lingon Airport, just outside Yorknew.

107
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,980
The trip between airport and hotel

108
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,670
takes approximately ninety minutes.

109
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,610
A special car has been prepared.

110
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,180
You four will provide the
outer ring of security.

111
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,740
Any questions?

112
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,860
Do you know who might
be targeting the boss?

113
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,080
That question isn't worth an answer.

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,330
What do you mean?

115
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,120
The boss is an important
figure in the underworld.

116
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,050
There are plenty of people with
reasons to hold a grudge.

117
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,130
Let me rephrase since you
didn't understand the first time.

118
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,610
Regardless of grudges, do you know

119
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,240
anyone who might actually
commit to an attack?

120
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,270
If we can identify a few candidates, we'll know
their motives, styles, and circumstances,

121
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,910
and we can prepare accordingly.

122
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,270
That will facilitate protecting the boss.

123
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,770
You said that your name is Kurapika?

124
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,520
You are the one who doesn't understand.

125
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,050
Our job is to protect the boss,

126
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,060
no matter who, when,
where, or how they attack.

127
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,280
That's all you need to know!

128
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,540
Don't bother building a mental profile.

129
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,670
If anything comes too close, it's hostile.

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll introduce you to the boss.

131
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,910
Come with me.

132
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,290
Excuse me.

133
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,480
What's that?

134
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,870
It's a little too realistic.

135
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,230
Yes, that is an actual human being.

136
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,450
He was once a fellow bodyguard.

137
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,890
He ignored my advice,

138
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,950
and let himself be deceived
by false information,

139
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,330
placing not only the other bodyguards,
but the boss in danger as well.

140
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
So he was punished.

141
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,710
You are replacing him.

142
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,770
Let's go.

143
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,560
Boss, I've brought the new bodyguards.

144
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,230
Please enter.

145
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,240
This is the boss, Neon-sama.

146
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,820
Nice to meet you, everyone.

147
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,850
Anyway, I was pretty surprised when
we were introduced to the boss.

148
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,680
No kidding...

149
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,730
They called her an important
figure in the underworld,

150
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,070
so I was expecting someone intimidating,

151
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,060
but she turned out to be a cute little girl.

152
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,440
Pakunoda, how's it going?

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,100
Long time no see, Shalnark.

154
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You, too, Phinks.

155
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,650
You sure took your time getting here.

156
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,190
Oh?

157
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,920
I believe I'm right on schedule.

158
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,090
You're supposed to arrive
ten minutes ahead of time.

159
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,280
Same to you guys.

160
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,650
Bonolenov!

161
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,410
Kortopi!

162
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,200
You guys are going with us, too?

163
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Yo!

164
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,780
Haven't seen your faces in a while.

165
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm here, chief.

166
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
What's our target this time?

167
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,180
Give us our orders!

168
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,390
Don't be in such a rush, Uvo.

169
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,380
Feitan's group won't arrive until evening.

170
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,070
We'll wait until everyone's here.

171
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,560
You have no patience.

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,750
Damn, half a day of waiting.

173
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,070
Oh?

174
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,130
Is that Shizuku?

175
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,570
Hello.

176
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,620
Has the other new addition arrived yet?

177
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,330
No idea...

178
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,770
You should ask Machi.

179
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,610
This is for September.

180
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,680
Huh? So many?

181
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,900
Yeah,

182
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,870
Rotfelli-sama and Trinc-sama
would like their fortunes told.

183
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,490
That just sucks.

184
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,410
I told you to stop increasing my workload.

185
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,310
I apologize.

186
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,750
Both of them are friendly with your father.

187
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,510
And what's Daddy doing?

188
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,760
He had to attend a meeting.

189
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,670
He's probably off playing golf or hunting.

190
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,960
Daddy? This is Neon.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,470
What? No!

192
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,270
You can't fool me!

193
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,780
No.

194
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,020
No!

195
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,460
Huh?

196
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,570
Fine, you have to keep your word.

197
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,030
If you break another promise, I'll quit.

198
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,040
Yay! I get another piece of treasure!

199
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,340
A sweet deal.

200
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,670
Congratulations.

201
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,980
Okay...

202
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,420
Since that's settled, I'll get this over with.

203
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,390
Angelic Auto Writing
Lovely Ghostwriter

204
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,660
I hear she's an incredible diviner.

205
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,690
Thanks to her father's connections,

206
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,540
she's made clients of some very
important people in the underworld.

207
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,050
No, it's the other way around.

208
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,390
Other way around?

209
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,590
I'd say that the father has used
his daughter to increase

210
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,800
his standing in the underworld.

211
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,180
That's why he is frightened of losing her.

212
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,510
Afraid that his enemies

213
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,570
might strike back at his daughter.

214
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,150
Okay, all done.

215
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,360
Here.

216
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,070
Excellent work.

217
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,820
Say, tomorrow's auction starts at night, right?

218
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,700
I want to do some shopping beforehand.

219
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,700
Very well, I shall accompany you.

220
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,830
How many years has it been

221
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,720
since all thirteen Troupe members gathered,

222
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
Feitan?

223
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,210
Three years, two months.

224
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,210
However, two members have since changed.

225
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,230
#4 and #8 are now different people.

226
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,940
Machi, will #4,

227
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
Hisoka, actually show up today?

228
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,050
No idea.

229
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,530
Don't ask me.

230
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,360
Wasn't he your responsibility?

231
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,490
I was only supposed to tell him to come.

232
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,720
I don't like Hisoka.

233
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,700
Why does the chief let
him do as he pleases?

234
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,490
Because he has skills.

235
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,460
Skills, huh?

236
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,190
His Bungee Gum is quite impressive.

237
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,510
It would be difficult to counter.

238
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,390
What's your point?

239
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,890
Are you claiming that the
chief is afraid of Hisoka?

240
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,380
I won't let that statement stand.

241
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,140
That's not what I meant.

242
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,400
You're all being too generous.
He's nothing special.

243
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,360
Talk is cheap, as always.

244
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,050
Nobunaga,

245
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,670
this is what happens when I
keep quiet and let you yap.

246
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,420
You were talking as much as I was, Franklin.

247
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,230
And so it begins.

248
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,520
Ignore them.

249
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,430
They're just playing around again.

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
Anyway, why is the chief
calling everyone together?

251
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,380
We're thieves.

252
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,640
There's something he wants us to steal.

253
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,350
Well, I know that much.

254
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,470
Yes, we've arrived at the hotel.

255
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,200
However, one of the lady's
fortunes concerned me...

256
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,200
"An underground chamber
where everything costs extra.

257
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,720
That is where you will sleep.

258
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,420
Never descend stairs that
you didn't first ascend.

259
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,210
Do not compete with others at numbers."

260
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,250
There were three other poems
that begin with this verse.

261
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,470
Meaning that all four clients
received the same fortune.

262
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,220
The only thing connecting them

263
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,730
is that they will be attending the
underground auction this year.

264
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,120
So the fortune is saying that
their lives are at risk,

265
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,610
should they participate?

266
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,830
I'm assuming that "sleep" is a metaphor

267
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,860
for succumbing to illness or death.

268
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,580
I understand.

269
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,870
I will pass the fortunes on to the clients.

270
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,120
One more thing.

271
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,000
The lady never remembers
the fortunes she's told,

272
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,880
and she cannot tell her own fortune.

273
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,630
Does it make sense to let her
participate in the auction?

274
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,720
No!

275
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,940
Bring her back immediately!

276
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,760
However, I will need a proper
explanation, or she'll never listen.

277
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,810
If she throws a tantrum,
we won't be able to stop her.

278
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,360
In any case, don't take her
to the auction site.

279
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,520
Send some bodyguards to place bids.

280
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,060
I understand.

281
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,730
Neon...

282
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,580
He's not coming.

283
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,600
The sun's about to rise.

284
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,670
Damn Hisoka...

285
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,530
Next time I see him, I'll tear him apart.

286
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,430
Oh, dear...

287
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,210
That sounds quite gruesome.

288
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,440
How very scary.

289
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,480
Hisoka, you bastard!

290
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,060
You're late.

291
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,570
Man, I thought you weren't going to come.

292
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,070
You asked me to come...

293
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,400
Had I broken my promise,

294
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,950
I would never get to see
your Nen Stitches again.

295
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,330
Chief, everyone's here.

296
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,300
Chief, what are we stealing this time?

297
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,850
We shall take the underground
auction's treasures.

298
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,970
Which ones?

299
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,850
Ancient texts?
Because the chief likes books.

300
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,730
No, I'm thinking games.

301
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,700
There will be multiple copies of the
most expensive game ever for sale.

302
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,860
Wouldn't it be logical to take
precious metals and gemstones?

303
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,810
Everything.

304
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,870
We're taking everything
that's up for auction.

305
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,620
Are you serious, chief?

306
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,270
The underground auction is run by
gangs from across the world.

307
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,470
If we do that, we'll be making
enemies of them all...

308
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,010
Are you frightened, Uvogin?

309
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,260
I'm thrilled!

310
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,270
I'm shaking with excitement...

311
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,520
Give us the command, chief!

312
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,020
Right now!

313
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,990
You have my permission...

314
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,180
Kill them.

315
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,440
Kill every person who interferes.

316
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,420
Good work.

317
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,760
I have your next assignment.

318
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,480
You must win the three items on this list
at the underground auction.

319
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,770
Money is no object.

320
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,190
The complete mummy of Princess Corco.

321
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,730
A tissue used by the actor, Son Remarch.

322
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,800
Complete with DNA validation.

323
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,320
And...

324
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,070
The eyeballs of a Kurta, also known

325
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,570
as scarlet eyes.

326
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,210
Also, we've received information that
there will be an attack on the auction.

327
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,240
Prepare for any unexpected complications,

328
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,590
while focusing on the primary
objective of obtaining these items.

329
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,800
They're coming.

330
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,600
They are definitely coming!

331
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,160
Kurapika awaits his chance
to avenge his brethren.

332
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,190
The Phantom Troupe,
a band of murdering thieves.

333
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,570
The sun has risen on the first day

334
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,450
