2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,230
How many are there?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,250
Around five thousand.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,730
And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,600
The King must be angry about that.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,710
No...

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,360
Apparently, he's been playing games in his room.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,740
He's so obsessed with Gungi,
he's been skipping meals.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,140
Then what about all this food?

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,940
Should we take it for ourselves?

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,890
You want to take on the King
and his Royal Guard?

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,620
Don't make me laugh.

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,130
Yeah...

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,520
Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone
is until you have enough strength yourself.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,690
They're monsters. I'll do as they say.

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,570
When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,820
he'd probably anticipated that
things would turn out this way.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,990
Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,770
If you call him by his old name, he gets mad.

20
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,990
Doubt x And x Hesitation

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,310
The suit with the glasses is keeping
a careful watch on his surroundings

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,000
while heading toward the palace.

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,860
The puppets are useless against him.

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,520
He's strong.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,010
What about his abilities?

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,050
Like the others, he has used
only physical attacks thus far.

27
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,390
Okay, let me know if he shows his power.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,700
Once Welfin and Brovada arrive,
we'll take care of those figures in white.

29
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,400
I can also check out the
powers those two have.

30
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,770
Damn, I lost sight of him!

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,660
Leol-sama, it appears that the suit
with glasses is able to teleport.

32
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,310
Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.

33
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,290
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex
Hide and Seek

34
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,300
It allows him to teleport.

35
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,810
By placing a hand against a wall or the ground,
he can open a portal to access Nen space.

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,470
He is able to transport people
and objects through that portal.

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,310
Hide and Seek creates a Nen space of
twenty-one rooms, on four floors.

38
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,340
Each room is isolated.

39
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,720
The entrance shuts when anyone enters,

40
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,950
so to return to the real world,
one must exit by a different door.

41
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,450
It is possible to create multiple entrances.

42
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,670
The number of possible entrances differs
depending on the size of the room.

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,150
The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,790
So, as a general rule, one can only enter
and exit via the location of the entry portal.

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,280
However, using Knov's master key,

46
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,870
an exit can be linked to any portal.

47
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,860
Nothing out of place.

48
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,120
Still quiet on the battlefront.

49
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,370
Morel's Deep Purple is used for
primarily defensive purposes.

50
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,960
If a puppet encounters someone who
isn't an ally, it will keep its distance.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,560
If it comes under attack, it will
retreat, while fighting back.

52
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,180
The puppets fight back by throwing
nearby objects at the enemy.

53
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,380
They avoid direct contact,

54
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,770
so the enemy won't realize
they are Nen puppets.

55
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,030
That's a Chimera...

56
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,810
What is it doing?

57
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,390
We're pretty far from the battlefield.

58
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,780
Is it scouting the area?

59
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,350
There were strange dragonflies around town.

60
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,790
I thought they were a local species,
but might they be created from his Nen?

61
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,800
It's very likely...

62
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,050
If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in
gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!

63
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,500
The battle is on.

64
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,020
Hey... Hey!

65
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,210
Aren't you gonna touch me?

66
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,800
Look how close I am...

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
I know you're awake.

68
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,090
Whoa, there!

69
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,330
I knew you were faking it.

70
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,080
You can't trick me!

71
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,160
With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!

72
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,090
Give me some peace and quiet!

73
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,020
No way!

74
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,940
I won't let you get any sleep!

75
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,610
I'll keep making noise until you chase me!

76
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,330
Idiot...

77
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,800
If that's what you wanted,
you should have set a rule

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,160
to force people to keep chasing you.

79
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,690
Looks like he's still getting
used to his new power...

80
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,910
Have it your way.

81
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,480
I won't be getting up for the next five hours.

82
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,490
He's really focused on making
this a contest of speed.

83
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,240
Coupled with his constant need for attention,

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,330
it's unlikely that he'll settle for
any other type of contest.

85
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not gonna let you sleep!

86
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,870
Hey! Over here!

87
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,540
I'm within reach...

88
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,510
Get up!

89
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,800
Look how close I am.

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,330
It's just a waiting game.

91
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,580
If he gives up and moves away...

92
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,770
I win.

93
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,250
9-9-1, marshal.

94
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,010
1-5-1, marshal.

95
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,510
7-9-1, pawn.

96
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,010
2-3-1, pawn.

97
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,430
8-1-1, spy.

98
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,020
2-3-1, cannon.

99
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,770
9-1-1, fortress.

100
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,780
2-7-2, musketeer.

101
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,060
The marshal has been isolated...

102
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,550
I'll call this "remote concealment."

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,660
7-1-2, fortress.

104
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,160
1-6-2, general.

105
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,470
9-1-3, archer.

106
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,730
3-2-2, major general.

107
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm done.

108
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,790
Her initial placement was exactly as expected.

109
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,430
She's shifting toward my marshal
without breaking her crane formation.

110
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,320
Let us begin, then.

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,690
Her first move will be to position
her archer on her right flank.

112
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,340
She'll probably try a three-pronged
attack to end it quickly.

113
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,420
But shifting her pieces to the right
exposes her left flank to attack.

114
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,650
It's time to disrupt your rhythm.

115
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,830
1-9-3, new archer.

116
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,330
There it is.

117
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,010
9-7-1, new spy.

118
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,430
2-9-1, knight.

119
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,630
Her three-pronged attack
and left flank movement

120
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,930
will cost me two pieces.

121
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,940
But that created an opening in her left flank.

122
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,290
She'll probably expect me to
go all-in from that side.

123
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,340
But I won't!

124
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,740
Here it is!

125
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,270
5-5-1, lieutenant general.

126
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,280
Each of her moves has followed
a set rhythm until just now,

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,460
when she froze.

128
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,210
Given the current placement,

129
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,190
I can attack through the
center in unlimited ways.

130
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,310
There is no best move.

131
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,610
With every turn, I have the
ability to extend the match.

132
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,570
Now, let me hear you

133
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,000
squeal!

134
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,500
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.

135
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,260
That's checkmate.

136
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,520
You knew my strategy was a dead end.

137
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,520
Dead End

138
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,520
Yes.

139
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,780
Why did you need to think
before making your move?

140
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,560
You could have made that move at once.

141
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,810
The King has moved this match off the board.

142
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,910
A wrong answer could mean

143
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,410
her death.

144
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,120
Your "remote concealment" strategy

145
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,070
is actually named "kokoriko."

146
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,420
I came up with that strategy...

147
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,670
ten years ago.

148
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,790
Placing the lieutenant general in the center

149
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,660
to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
move I devised, called "general in the middle."

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,510
At the time, both drew a lot of attention.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,720
Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle
was a popular transition that tested

152
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,870
both players' ability to read their opponents.

153
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,690
I was pretty happy

154
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:27,220
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...

155
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,960
But then, I saw how to defeat it.

156
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,430
A year after I came up with kokoriko,

157
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,080
an opponent used it against me
in the national tournament,

158
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,470
and I figured out how to counter it.

159
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,590
I won the match,

160
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,410
but the strategy disappeared from
official matches and textbooks.

161
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,250
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...

162
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,790
I was so honored, and touched...
My heart trembled.

163
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,030
It felt like...

164
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,000
Like seeing my child brought back to life.

165
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,650
That was how it felt.

166
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,610
So it was difficult for me
to take that life again.

167
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,740
That was why

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,670
I hesitated.

169
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,020
Foolishness.

170
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,020
I've had enough.

171
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,340
Get some rest.

172
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,330
Once we begin again,

173
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,120
you won't get any more breaks.

174
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,290
Be prepared!

175
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,850
Y-Yes...

176
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
I believe this is

177
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,290
the first time the King has ever listened
to anyone speak for such a long time.

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Well,

179
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,230
it should have no significance...

180
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,810
Four hours have passed?

181
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,740
He got bored and started reading...

182
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,070
That guy's too easy to understand.

183
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh, you're ready to start?

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,070
Has it already been five hours?

185
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,480
Wait, it's only half full.

186
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,050
Are you getting worried?

187
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,840
You just noticed?

188
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,850
We aren't starting now.

189
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,100
It's already over.

190
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,850
Look at your ankle.

191
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,100
A rope of smoke?

192
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,600
That took a lot of effort...

193
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,830
I had to go all the way around
so you wouldn't notice,

194
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,610
so it turned into quite a long rope.

195
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,730
In any case, all that's left
is to wind up the rope.

196
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,870
Now it's only a matter of time.

197
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,380
Your turn to try whatever you can.

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,460
But it won't work.

199
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,700
You should take the smoke seriously.

200
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,310
Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed.

201
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,930
You can struggle all you want.

202
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,710
I knew it...

203
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,560
He won't attack me because
this is a game of tag.

204
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,900
If I touch his body, it will break his ability.

205
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,820
He has no patience, but he chose
for the game to last eight hours.

206
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,590
I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.

207
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,920
The pressure's on you.

208
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,350
Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.

209
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,290
With his back against the wall,
desperate for a way out...

210
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,360
He created a new ability.

211
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,990
A crossbow and claws.

212
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,090
He can fight at any range.

213
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Thanks!

214
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,990
You helped me gain an awesome new power!

215
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,860
Hey, do you know what this is?

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,010
It's a bow. A bow!

217
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,850
You sure you want to come closer?!

218
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,520
There!

219
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,270
I'm quite sure.

220
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,530
Why would you want a power
that's slower than you are?

221
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
Ah.

222
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,290
Why don't you try those claws?

223
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,260
Then I won't have to walk over.

224
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,290
I'll tell you why you lost.

225
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,040
It's because

226
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,770
you're an idiot.

227
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,330
Die!

228
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,890
Then you can never touch me!

229
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,100
This sensation...

230
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,200
It can't be...

231
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,150
Smoke?

232
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,270
No way!

233
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,990
Caught you.

234
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,060
Wh-When did you...

235
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,790
While you were reading manga
and laughing like a fool,

236
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,000
I created a copy of myself from smoke.

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,190
And I covered myself with smoke
that looked like grass.

238
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,300
My copy went one way, and I went the other.

239
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,900
The fight continues, even while one sleeps.

240
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,680
You shouldn't have looked away.

241
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,120
Looks like we're back...

242
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,430
Well, do you still want to fight?

243
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,870
No, I've had enough.

244
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,940
That's a wise decision...

245
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,610
Then why not tell me

246
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,510
what would have happened
if I hadn't caught you?

247
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,720
There's no point in asking.

248
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,940
Once I've been caught,
I can't use that power anymore.

249
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,430
That was the condition I set.

250
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,960
Really? I feel bad...

251
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,860
It's no big deal.

252
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,980
I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!

253
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,250
Next time, I won't lose.

254
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,880
You'd better be ready!

255
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,970
His superior

256
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,040
is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,

257
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,730
who has the power to release Nen skills.

258
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,080
So if the selection is carried out,
winning will become very difficult.

259
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,490
Gon and Killua made the right choice.

260
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,470
We need to meet.

261
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,610
Let's talk inside.

262
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,860
Reinforcements have arrived.

263
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,630
It's a crayfish and a wolf.

264
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,930
Are they strong?

265
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,000
If I knew, my job would be easier...

266
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,510
Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength.

267
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,660
So it's currently a stalemate.

268
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,250
Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out.

269
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,140
I suspect it's because I took out this one.

270
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,910
Those dragonflies were acting
as security cameras.

271
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,330
Come in, Flutter!

272
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,180
Doesn't seem he's going to show.

273
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,900
Change in plans!

274
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,480
Without Flutter, we have no way
to know the enemy's location.

275
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,320
Damn.

276
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,280
When it really counts, he lets me down!

277
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,300
Should I call it off?

278
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,290
No, I can't do that.

279
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,290
I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!

280
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,170
We're heading back, then.

281
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,100
Ah, hold on...

282
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,170
It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.

283
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,670
Rental Pod
IOU Dispenser

284
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,930
Is that your power?

285
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,380
Yeah, I can use it to scout around.

286
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't tell anyone else...

287
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,950
I'm showing you because I trust you.

288
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,370
Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth.

289
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,440
Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily

290
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,050
borrow an ability in exchange
for granting the target a favor.

291
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,870
However, two conditions must be met.

292
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,250
First,

293
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,350
he must have seen the ability or know its name.

294
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,710
Satellite Dragonflies

295
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,590
Second, he must grant a favor.

296
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,050
After confirming that his favor is not
free and is expected to be repaid,

297
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:05,580
this skill will activate, assuming
the target agrees to his conditions.

298
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,210
Got it!

299
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,720
Once all conditions are met, Leol's
dispenser automatically stores data,

300
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,070
which can be checked at any time.

301
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,480
However, if the target dies,
the data will be deleted.

302
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,590
Flutter's fine.

303
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,880
I believe there's been no communication

304
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,910
because he's unconscious or far away.

305
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,500
A rental can be used for one hour.

306
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,420
During the rental period, the target
cannot use the borrowed power.

307
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,080
Anyway, Flutter is still alive...

308
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,580
Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.

309
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,120
Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies

310
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,110
verify the location of the suit
with the glasses, we'll start.

311
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,130
So we keep the small fry at a distance
while you take on the suit with the glasses.

312
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,430
You gonna be okay on your own?

313
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,070
Just trust me. I wouldn't give
you a job you can't handle.

314
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,970
And I don't want you to see my power.

315
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,140
I'll do whatever it takes to
complete this mission.

316
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,540
Okay...

317
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,220
I can't afford to wait around here.

318
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,460
Not until the King is in my debt!

319
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,380
When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and
tears it up, the effect activates.

320
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,750
They're here.

321
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,790
Time to start scouting.

322
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,690
I don't understand.

323
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,590
This is upsetting.

324
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,770
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.

325
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,560
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.

326
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,490
But...

327
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,260

328
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,210
But I don't understand why...

329
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,340
Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.

330
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,380
Morel-san, what's in your pipe?

331
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,480
It holds...

332
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,590
Gulp.

333
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,730
