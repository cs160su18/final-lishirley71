00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:11,570
With the detonation of Miniature Rose,
the bomb activated by the stopping of his heart,

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,780
Netero perished with the King.

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love

5
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,010
Your Majesty!

6
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,520
He's breathing!

7
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,770
But damn it...

8
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,650
We must hurry... Or it'll
be too late for the King!

9
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,760
And there isn't time to take him to Pitou!

10
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,980
It will be fine...

11
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,620
I will save the King.

12
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,290
How?

13
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,580
I will feed myself to him...

14
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,210
That's all there is to it.

15
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,980
Come, my cells!

16
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,620
Diffuse throughout the King and heal him!

17
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,480
Your Majesty!

18
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,650
Your Majesty...

19
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,360
Are you all right?

20
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,190
How do you feel?

21
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,350
This exquisite taste...

22
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,950
I feel as though I am breathing the air of paradise.

23
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,260
My strength is returning...

24
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,090
This is a fairy mist.

25
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,300
I am...

26
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,520
I am not worthy of such praise!

27
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,140
I am happy to hear that.

28
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,200
Please feast to your heart's content.

29
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,230
There is plenty here.

30
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,590
I crave it...

31
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,690
Now that I have experienced this taste,

32
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,480
I cannot eat anything else...

33
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,610
Your Majesty...

34
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,490
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

35
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:56,760
Please stop taking me to the heights
of heaven's bliss with your praise!

36
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,640
No more!

37
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,910
Your Majesty!

38
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,320
Your Majesty!

39
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,980
You may also feed on this.

40
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,260
He's liquefying his cells.

41
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,760
You thought this through, Youpi.

42
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,220
It's so powerful and rich...

43
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,540
Surely, this comes from the heavens.

44
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,300
Drops of angels themselves...

45
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,390
Your Majesty!

46
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,100
There is no way to compare the two.

47
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,830
All I can say is that I have never

48
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,090
tasted better...

49
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,890
Not enough...

50
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,270
I need more.

51
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,700
Bring me as much as you can of both...

52
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,370
Yes!

53
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,870
My King!

54
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,240
With pleasure!

55
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,220
Supreme bliss...

56
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,540
Unparalleled joy.

57
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,280
What is this?

58
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,910
What is this feeling?

59
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,920
From now on, call me Meruem...

60
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,190
That is the name my mother gave me.

61
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,330
I see...

62
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,990
So this is...

63
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,640
...unconditional love!

64
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,160
Having witnessed an absolute
being's death and rebirth,

65
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,460
and having shared their own beings with the King,

66
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,500
Pouf and Youpi had at last reached

67
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,510
the pinnacle of their species...
The level of Queen.

68
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,200
It's clear that his strength has increased.

69
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,460
He's even stronger now!

70
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,720
Our bodies have helped the King...

71
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,030
And become part of him.

72
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,220
What an honor... What bliss!

73
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,470
The King's heartbeat! The King's warmth!

74
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,240
We even share the King's thoughts!

75
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,440
However...

76
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,990
That is why we know...

77
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,780
The King is currently...

78
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,870
...confused.

79
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,600
Your Majesty!

80
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,580
M-Meruem-sama...

81
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,640
How do you feel?

82
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,290
Should we return to the palace first?

83
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,280
If you wish for more of that food,
we can provide it.

84
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,150
In a few minutes, my clones will arrive.

85
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,790
Food...

86
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,230
Ah...

87
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,920
Then that taste was real.

88
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,320
As I wandered through the light,
I heard someone call my name.

89
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,730
Calling, "Meruem."

90
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,800
I do not know if that was a dream or reality.

91
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,560
I cannot remember why

92
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,090
I am here.

93
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,720
Meruem-sama...

94
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,050
You've lost your memory?

95
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,660
I feel fine.

96
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,570
In fact, I am brimming with energy.

97
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,320
But my mind is hazy...

98
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,110
Why have your appearances changed?

99
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,470
We sent our clones to scout the area.

100
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,250
They are searching for remaining
enemies to dispose of—

101
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,240
You may have my best interests in mind.

102
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,510
But when you lie to me, you betray me.

103
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,020
You will not get a second chance.

104
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,870
So, I was eating you.

105
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,410
We offered ourselves to you!

106
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,680
We know we acted beyond our places!

107
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,660
But we made the decision!

108
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,040
What happened? Give me an explanation.

109
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,300
Before we can do that,
I must ask you one question.

110
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,870
It appears that you recall
our former appearances.

111
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,060
Do you remember the day
we first began serving you?

112
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,510
I do not.

113
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,740
I recognized that you were my
Royal Guards Pouf and Youpi

114
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,250
the moment I saw you.

115
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,580
No, I should say I remembered that you were.

116
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,330
However, I cannot recall anything
about how that came to be.

117
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,960
Meruem-sama...

118
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,090
I believe you are suffering from temporary
memory loss due to the explosion.

119
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,370
Explosion?

120
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,220
Yes.

121
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,980
You came here to engage
in a duel with the enemy.

122
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,150
However, the cowardly human

123
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,610
resorted to the underhanded
trick of using a powerful bomb,

124
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,580
betraying your honorable intentions!

125
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,450
A duel...

126
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,540
Yes...

127
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,910
I was

128
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,230
fighting a duel.

129
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,770
We knew that, given your power and fortune,

130
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,390
a mere human weapon could
never deal a lethal blow.

131
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,140
However, we could not bear
to see you in that state.

132
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,330
So we did what we could to speed your recovery,

133
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,650
knowing full well that we might be punished.

134
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,440
Our bodies have always been yours.

135
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,660
We were simply returning them to you.

136
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,670
Let's return to the palace!

137
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,570
That will be the fastest way
for you to regain your memory!

138
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,350
This is

139
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,990
my perfect

140
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,180
chance!

141
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,090
If I return to the palace first,

142
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,690
I can dispose of her!

143
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,890
At the moment, the King does not remember her.

144
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,590
If I eliminate her now,

145
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,080
he will never have the chance to remember her!

146
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,580
This will require...

147
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,920
Convincing Pitou?

148
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,380
Getting rid of that meddling human?

149
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,090
No...

150
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,840
The first thing to do

151
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,630
is to end her life.

152
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,420
If I kill her, everything else will fall into place.

153
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,490
The King will need twenty
minutes to reach the palace,

154
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,940
and that is if he runs at full speed.

155
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,560
I have enough time to kill her.

156
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,240
This feels as natural as though
I was born with these.

157
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,550
I will learn to fly in no time.

158
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,940
Which way to the palace?

159
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,600
North.

160
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,200
You should be able to make
it in fifteen minutes!

161
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,460
It's there.

162
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,960
The answer I seek is in the palace.

163
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,140
He is fast!

164
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,000
If I waste too much time, he'll catch up!

165
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,480
Fifteen minutes?

166
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,990
No, at this speed, he'll arrive in five minutes...

167
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,830
I have but two to three minutes.

168
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,520
Quickly, my clones!

169
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,830
This is a gamble.

170
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,500
Once the King sees the millions
of humans outside the palace,

171
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,590
he will remember everything!

172
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,330
Remember that his objective
is to rule all living creatures!

173
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,640
So long as he doesn't see that woman!

174
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,660
As a Royal Guard...

175
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,740
As one who has inherited the Queen's will...

176
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,740
I must eliminate that lowly human girl!

177
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,100
She's gone!

178
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,420
Where is she?

179
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,340
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!

180
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,350
I've seen you once before.

181
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,860
Before I was placed in the cocoon.

182
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,990
So I can see you, no matter where you are.

183
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,120
Wink Blue: Lonesome Deep Sea Fish

184
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,240
What?

185
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,880
What just attacked my clone?

186
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,020
It came from nowhere.

187
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,380
Pouf, what is that?

188
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,940
I don't know.

189
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,890
It seems to have resulted from the
remaining enemies attacking my clone.

190
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,650
We must hurry.

191
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,320
The King!

192
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,700
The King is alive.

193
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,260
Next time:

194
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,850
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.

195
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,170
You know how people say "like" all the time?

196
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,800
Sure.

197
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,100
So wouldn't it be a, like, "Formidable-like
Enemy x And x Clear-like Objective"-like thing?

198
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,390
Uh...
