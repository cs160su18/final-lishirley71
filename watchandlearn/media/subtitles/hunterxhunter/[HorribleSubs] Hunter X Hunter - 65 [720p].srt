2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,650
So, then...

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,390
Where are we on the island?

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,650
Let's steal an Accompany card and go.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,410
Uninvited guests?

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,490
I'm getting nervous...

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,220
Just so we're clear,

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,280
you didn't wash up on shore, right?

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,600
After all, if you'd let the waves carry you,

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,460
it would be impossible to reach this island.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,930
This guy's strong.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,230
Who are you?

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,560
Are you supposed to be our tour guide?

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm one of the designers of this game.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,390
The name's Razor.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,090
I mainly handle the Emitter spells,

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,740
including all movement via spells

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,740
and dealing with external threats.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,000
Eliminate
Send all trespassers
on Greed Island to a
random location on
the Azian continent
[LR][SP]

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,430
This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,760
Sorry, but you'll have to leave.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,140
You're more than welcome to
visit via official channels.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,880
From there, if you defeat me,
you can receive an item.

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,450
Should you decide to play,

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,010
we'll probably get to fight eventually.

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,560
Sounds good...

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,810
We'll come back.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,770
Through the front door.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,690
Eliminate on.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,930
Hmm, those were some strong Nen users...

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors

32
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,160
As Gon continues to train,

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,510
he discovers a hint to developing
a new technique, and that is...

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,970
First comes rock!

35
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,260
Rock... Paper...

36
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,580
Rock!

37
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,780
I see.

38
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,030
Here comes the next one!

39
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,780
First comes rock!

40
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,530
Rock... Paper...

41
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,860
Paper!

42
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,600
Bisky, how do I make my Nen fly?

43
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,420
Train more!

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,420
So paper is an Emitter technique?

45
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,570
Uh-huh.

46
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,790
And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.

47
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,170
I wanna be able to cut through rock.

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,690
I understand.

49
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,680
That's a reasonable fighting technique.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,180
But such a childish idea.

51
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,600
You know how it takes time
to focus Nen in my fist?

52
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,180
I was trying to think of a good
way to spend that time.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,280
And when you were talking about
rock-paper-scissors, it hit me.

54
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Because I like rock-paper-scissors.

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,530
Trusting your instincts is important.

56
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,560
Your gut plays a big role in
techniques that require

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,330
multiple Nen categories.

58
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,150
The key is that it should feel right to you.

59
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,130
Ah... Ahem.

60
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,320
Well, this is all I can manage right now,

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,500
but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,140
That's awesome, Killua!

63
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,720
You're like an electric eel!

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,020
That's a horrible comparison!

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,020
He can already change Nen into
electricity at such a young age?

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,810
Frightening...

67
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,030
And very tragic...

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,030
His childhood must have been a living hell.

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,380
It's a miracle that he can smile now.

70
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,040
Indeed...

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,290
They make a great team.

72
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,760
Well, let's take a break, then.

73
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,280
It's a little early, but we can have a party.

74
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,420
A party?

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,240
What do you boys do back home to celebrate?

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,310
Celebrate?

77
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,440
In the outside world, it's almost New Year's.

78
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,250
Time flows at the same speed
inside the game as outside.

79
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,800
Oops!

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,700
The deadline to apply for the
Hunter Exam is coming up!

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,700
And our training was just starting to get fun...

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,290
I believe you're required to apply
before the end of the year.

83
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,130
We need to hurry.

84
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,410
How do we get outside?

85
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm guessing there are spell
cards to leave the game?

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,010
In that case, let's head to Masadora.

87
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,470
Agreed!

88
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,250
Well, let's find a place to have a drink.

89
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,030
We can't... There's no time.

90
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,270
We can ask around the stores.

91
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,270
How to leave the island?

92
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,200
That'll be 3,000 Jenny.

93
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,150
If you go about fifty kilometers west,

94
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,410
you'll reach the island's only port.

95
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,030
You must defeat or bribe
the chief of that port

96
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,290
to receive a ticket that will
transport you outside.

97
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,540
How big of a bribe are we talking?

98
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,880
Depends on how the chief's feeling.

99
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,790
Ah...

100
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,450
Your other option is to
use a Leave spell card,

101
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,550
but that's a rare one.

102
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,360
What do we do?

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Let's head for the port.

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,140
If it's a rare card, we could buy
a bunch without finding one.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,510
True.

106
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,820
Passage Ticket

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,220
Voilà.

108
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,640
Well, I'll go pass the test real
quick, and then hurry back.

109
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,410
There are monsters called Kiriko
that live beneath a cedar tree

110
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,450
on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.

111
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,580
If you tell them you're my friend,

112
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,210
they'll take you to the exam area.

113
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,700
Okay.

114
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,530
See ya.

115
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,220
Then let's get back to training.

116
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,010
Osu!

117
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,270
Welcome.

118
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,680
Is this where I started?

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,370
No, it's not...

120
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,460
The girl looks similar, though.

121
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,530
Well, that's not so unusual in games.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
You are leaving the island, right?

123
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,500
Please select a destination.

124
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,780
Do you know Dolle Harbor?

125
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,690
Yes, I do.

126
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,290
Then send me there.

127
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,120
Understood.

128
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,240
When you leave this island,

129
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,650
the cards in your free slots will disappear.

130
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,990
Is that okay?

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,550
Yeah, it's fine.

132
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,470
Then we shall await your return.

133
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,310
I'm back in the real world now?

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,830
Doesn't feel that way.

135
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,630
Book.

136
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,620
Oh, it doesn't work out here.

137
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,810
Once I submit my application,
I'll head for that cedar tree.

138
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,960
First, I should shower and
change into fresh clothes.

139
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,380
Okay, train while you run!

140
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,110
When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9
in one minute, you'll clear this stage.

141
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,390
That hurt!

142
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,560
What are you doing?

143
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,580
Aren't you...

144
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,240
Your other friend isn't here?

145
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,210
What's that machine on your shoulder?

146
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,160
Did something happen?

147
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,590
We were fooled by the Bomber.

148
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Will you listen to my story?

149
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,130
So he was the Bomber...

150
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,060
The others are waiting at our base for
the Bomber to disarm the bombs.

151
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,730
They believe the terms he gave them,

152
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,890
even though it was probably a bluff.

153
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,620
Can't anything be done?

154
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,820
If they're prepared to accept casualties...

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,890
It's impossible.

156
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,140
The first people to attack
will be the ones who die.

157
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,410
Who would volunteer for that role?

158
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,400
True...

159
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,030
Jispa was our group's strongest fighter,

160
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,160
and he was defeated in an instant.

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,960
At that point, our loss was assured.

162
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,220
And allowing him to leave the game

163
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,590
was a fatal mistake.

164
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,190
We indulged in a moment's victory cheer

165
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,960
before we could verify each
member's cards and assign roles.

166
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,970
That's when he caught us off guard.

167
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,470
It's embarrassing to admit,

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,710
but I was so distracted,
I didn't notice him using Leave

169
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,840
until it was already too late.

170
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,360
You were probably focused on
understanding his explanation.

171
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,530
Yeah.

172
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,640
We were thrust into that
situation with no warning.

173
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,210
Given our mental state, there was
no action we could have taken.

174
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,120
But why are you telling us this?

175
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,960
Because, of everyone I've met on this island,

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,680
you are the ones I believe I can most rely on.

177
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,680
If you run into any other players,

178
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,370
please tell them about the Bomber.

179
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,660
Once everyone knows how his ability works,

180
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,140
they should be able to protect themselves.

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,400
And if possible, I would
like you to avenge us!

182
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,160
If not,

183
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,210
could you at least promise that
you won't let him clear the game?

184
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:12,960
Yeah.

185
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
Understood.

186
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,970
Sorry...

187
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,450
I'll use what time I have remaining

188
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,230
to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.

189
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,550
Book.

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,810
Return on.

191
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,540
Bunzen!

192
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,720
Just kidding...

193
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,170
The truth is that they were
the only players I could find

194
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,050
using Magnetic Force.

195
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,550
Even a pig can climb a tree if
you give it enough praise.

196
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,940
Every thousandth of a percent counts

197
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,120
when it comes to deactivating someone's Nen.

198
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,380
Well, Nickes probably left to
meet with the bombers.

199
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,200
If the mass disarmament

200
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,260
turns out to be a mass explosion...

201
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,450
I should get started.

202
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,960
You're finally here.

203
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,460
Now give me your ring.

204
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,220
Jispa's dead.

205
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,470
That's nice. Your ring.

206
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,470
Disarm everyone's bombs first!

207
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,470
Hell, no.

208
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,630
I have to enter the game with your ring,

209
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
and confirm that the cards
really are all inside.

210
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,990
I'll disarm the bombs after that.

211
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,100
I'll give you one more chance.

212
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,990
Hand over the ring.

213
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,270
Sub, put it on.

214
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,410
If you put on a second ring outside the game,

215
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,570
you'll overwrite the data.

216
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,060
Now, let's head back inside together.

217
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,010
Wait, what was your name?

218
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,480
Migamura, Samingadura,

219
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,530
Interaminga, Zenberarubura.

220
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,590
Spirits of the forest,

221
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,020
remove the tainted Nen that resides within me.

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,570
Now, then...

223
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,800
What horrors will come of this?

224
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,320
I borrow power from the forest spirits,

225
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,620
to use my Conjurer ability

226
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,790
to create a Nen beast, capable of
consuming other people's Nen!

227
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,870
It's huge!

228
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,470
The Bomber's Countdown must be
a particularly strong technique.

229
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,970
How'd it go?

230
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,460
Has he disarmed the bombs yet?

231
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,320
Book.

232
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,820
81 restricted slot card types.

233
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,710
They're all here, all right.

234
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,900
We did as you requested...

235
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,590
Disarm the bombs!

236
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,370
But of course.

237
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,770
I'm a man of my word.

238
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,840
But first, hand over three Leave cards.

239
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,110
Okay, we have a deal.

240
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,880
Sub... Bara...

241
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,490
Let's do this.

242
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,960
Release.

243
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,330
I released you

244
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,240
from your terror.

245
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,370
Th-That wasn't the deal...

246
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,290
Why should I keep a promise

247
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,880
I made to a bunch of scum?

248
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,880
Release was the signal to explode, not disarm.

249
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,550
Leave on!

250
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,170
At least now, I don't have
to worry about exploding.

251
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,940
But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies,

252
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,670
this thing won't disappear.

253
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,810
I have a troublesome partner now...

254
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,710
Hey, stop moving!

255
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,630
The Bomber thinks he killed us all.

256
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,350
I'll let him believe that...

257
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,840
Until I make my move!

258
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,470
Bisky...

259
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,760
I think we should drop by
their base real fast.

260
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,450
They already ran out of time.

261
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,240
Besides, he didn't even
tell us exactly where it is.

262
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,500
And even if we did know,

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,240
we don't have a spell card
that could take us there.

264
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,100
I know.

265
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,850
But some of them might have
survived the explosion...

266
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,010
Doubt it.

267
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,920
If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs
on all his targets without anyone noticing,

268
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,290
he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.

269
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,300
However...

270
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,400
If we continue to play this game,

271
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,530
we'll probably run into the Bomber.

272
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,040
Given that, we may need
to visit their base soon.

273
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,700
Uh-huh.

274
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,120
We need spell cards.

275
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,770
Let's go to Masadora and
sell our monster cards

276
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,810
to buy spell cards.

277
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,280
Yeah!

278
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,980
Hey, Bisky...

279
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,560
How long do you think it'll take me
to master my special technique?

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,660
You're just starting to develop your Nen.

281
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,230
It's hard to predict when your
power and speed will peak.

282
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,720
Oh...

283
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,430
But it shouldn't take too long

284
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,170
before you get the form down.

285
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,280
Really? How long?

286
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,190
Let's see...

287
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,640
Hopefully, you'll have it ready
by the time Killua returns.

288
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,450
All right!

289
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,340
I'll finish my technique and surprise him!

290
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,650
You two are lucky!

291
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,200
We just received a huge
shipment of spell cards.

292
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,340
These are the spell cards they'd gathered.

293
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,960
We bought sixty between us,
so there are lots of different types.

294
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,460
Look.

295
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,970
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed.
(Only targets pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

296
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,780
An S-rank card...

297
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,670
There are only ten in the whole game!

298
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,200
What do you think?

299
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,920
Should we save it?

300
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,470
Or use it now?

301
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,290
I don't know what to do!

302
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,020
Shh!

303
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,400
You're too loud...

304
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,730
People will get suspicious!

305
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,620
If only Killua were here...

306
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,790
I can smell Gon on you.

307
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,750
I'd like to see him again...

308
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,990
We'll take you to the exam site.

309
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,070
I need to zip on over and
breeze through the exam,

310
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,300
so I can hurry back to Gon.

311
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,640
But the exam won't begin for a few days.

312
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,260
Oh, right.

313
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,570
In the meantime, you can tell
us about yourself and Gon.

314
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,590
I'll start with the story about
when he came to visit my home.

316
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,410
You're making steady progress.

317
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,230
You're on track to have your
special technique ready.

318
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,420
This is a safe place to practice.

319
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,800
Since we'll be able to spot anyone
before they're in attack spell range.

320
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,840
I can sense people watching from Masadora,

321
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,980
just like I sensed people
watching us at the start point.

322
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,680
But we have plenty of defense spells now.

323
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,930
Well, just to be safe,

324
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,660
I used a Blackout Curtain card.

325
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,940
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy.
(Does not stack when used on target already under
effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]

326
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,520
But no point in worrying about spell cards.

327
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,100
Just focus on training hard.

328
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,590
Osu!

329
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay, one minute's up.

330
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
Next.

331
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,810
It didn't work.

332
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,440
I can't reach it...

333
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,730
That was just fine.

334
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,970
You're in far better shape than
a Transmuter would be!

335
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,930
Be patient, and start by focusing
on maintaining your aura

336
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,680
in a sphere for extended periods of time.

337
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,980
Osu!

338
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,870
The longer you can maintain the
sphere, the stronger your Ten.

339
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,740
Once you've trained long enough,

340
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,470
you'll be able to maintain an aura
sphere for two to three days!

341
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,770
You should be able to reach that
stone before the day's out.

342
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,900
You're right! I reached it!

343
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,760
That was fast!

344
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,070
This proves he's been hard at work
on his Ten and Ren every day.

345
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,660
Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics.

346
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,530
Osu!

347
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,580
Gon continues to train with Bisky,
to master his special technique.

348
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,430
Killua has temporarily left the game
to retake the Hunter Exam.

349
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,900
The two boys are working
hard toward their goals.

350
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,780
G.I. Tutorial

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

352
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,300
Today, we introduce the card Blackout Curtain.

353
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:18,910
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal
or Fluoroscopy. (Does not stack
when used on target already
under effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]

354
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,730
With this card,

355
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,810
other players can't see inside your binder.

356
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,700
You can see inside my binder
whenever you want, Killua.

357
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,460
What?!

358
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,930
Continue!

359
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,660
Next time: Strategy x And x Scheme.

360
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Gon-kun!

361
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Killua-kun!

362
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey, show me what you've got!
