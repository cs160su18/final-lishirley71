00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, for verification...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Are you Pakunoda, from the Troupe?

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,610
Of course.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,710
She's telling the truth.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,210
I will present each of you with two conditions.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,150
If you abide by them,
I will release your leader.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,970
Pay attention, Pakunoda.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,010
He's more concerned about his friends
than killing me for his vengeance.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,730
That is the chain user's weakness!

11
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,060
Signal x To x Retreat

12
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,260
I'll begin with the leader.

13
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,460
First, you are forbidden to use Nen.

14
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,070
Second...

15
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,060
Am I certain about this?

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,030
If I eliminate the boss,
the spider will fall apart.

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,460
That was the whole idea.

18
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,420
But...

19
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,670
I have no value as a hostage.

20
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,770
Everything he says is true.

21
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,750
But the spider can move,
even without a head.

22
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,260
The leader isn't absolute...

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,270
If necessary, the group is
willing to abandon its leader.

24
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,190
That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,190
I can disable their leader,
but that won't cripple the Troupe!

26
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,160
However, is there any alternative?

27
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,290
Is there some kind of miracle

28
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,200
that can get me out of this bind?!

29
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,800
There isn't.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,690
I can think of nothing...

31
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,380
Yes, this is right.

32
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,270
Right now, this is what I should do.

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,670
I must get them back.

34
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,310
That is my top priority!

35
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,670
I don't want to lose

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,200
any more friends!

37
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,590
Second, you may not contact
any member of the Troupe.

38
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,070
Those are the two conditions.

39
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,740
And to make certain that you adhere to them,

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,040
I will use my Judgment Chain,
the Arbiter Little Finger, on your leader.

41
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,290
You decide if this is acceptable, Pakunoda.

42
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,160
Okay.

43
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,520
You're next, Pakunoda.

44
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,790
First,

45
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,300
release Gon and Killua unharmed,
before midnight, without any tricks.

46
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,030
Second, you may not speak
a single word about me.

47
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,330
If you have no objections,
I will use my chain on you.

48
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,980
Okay.

49
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,300
If Gon and Killua were being
controlled by a Manipulator,

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,030
could you tell from their heartbeats?

51
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,300
It's certainly possible.

52
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,360
I've met Killua-kun, and I know how
his normal heartbeat sounds.

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,410
So I could tell if anything had changed.

54
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,680
That's good enough.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
I have something to say before the exchange.

56
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,820
Kurapika...

57
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,250
In the back of your mind,
you sense that something is amiss.

58
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,080
Why did she come alone?

59
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,440
If the Troupe were as merciless as expected,

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,590
this deal would be impossible.

61
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,960
You people are the ones on the ropes.

62
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,720
Their rules are ironclad,

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
and their boss accepts them.

64
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,580
But what about the others?

65
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,230
This woman appears to be different.

66
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,980
This woman you despise
with everything you have

67
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,580
is driven by the same motive that drives you.

68
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,240
She wishes

69
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,310
to save her companion, her boss.

70
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,010
You must have realized this.

71
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,220
Start by returning to your companions.

72
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,240
Inform them of the hostage exchange.

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,570
I want you to bring the hostages to
Lingon Airport before midnight.

74
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,200
Bring no one else.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,860
Tell no one where you're going.

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,450
Very well.

77
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,390
You have a deal.

78
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,270
Take me back to the airport.

79
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,020
Why haven't you asked any questions?

80
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,940
You know who I am, don't you?

81
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,530
You aren't worried?

82
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,440
You don't find this deal unreasonable?

83
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,040
Do you truly believe I'll return your leader?

84
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,540
Yes.

85
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,460
You wouldn't ask those questions

86
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,900
if you intended to deceive me.

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,050
Does he really expect us to
accept those conditions?

88
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,350
Tell us where he is, Pakunoda.

89
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,690
We'll kill the kids, then deal
with the chain user.

90
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,190
You're insisting?

91
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,660
I insist.

92
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,190
If you don't tell us, I won't let you leave.

93
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,070
I refuse to tell you where he is,
and I am taking the kids alone.

94
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,820
Don't interfere.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,010
Interfere?

96
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,330
Who's the one interfering with our plans?!

97
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,330
Go, Pakunoda.

98
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,080
We'll stop them.

99
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,200
Stop us?

100
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
Are you trying to insult us?

101
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,810
You're serious?

102
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,790
I don't get it.

103
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,340
Have you lost your minds?

104
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,330
I bet they were defeated by the
chain user before we arrived.

105
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,970
They're probably under his control.

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,980
This is a waste of time.

107
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll make them talk.

108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,600
Is it really so hard to understand?

109
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,620
You don't understand why Pakunoda
wants to leave without a word?

110
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,270
You don't understand why
Machi is stopping you?

111
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,540
You honestly think they're being controlled?

112
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,650
They want to rescue your boss!

113
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,330
Is it so hard to understand
the desire to save a friend?

114
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,870
Shut up, kid!

115
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,500
Are you that desperate to be spared?

116
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm not doing this for my sake.

117
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,140
Take back those words!

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
Good grief.

119
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,010
I refuse.
If you've a problem, come here.

120
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,900
The second you take a step,
I'll rip your head off.

121
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,900
Then I won't budge an inch!

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Kurapika isn't like you.

123
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,990
No matter how much he hates someone,

124
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,330
he wouldn't lose control and
kill them without mercy.

125
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,090
If he makes a promise,

126
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,970
he will definitely keep his word!

127
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,420
After meeting him in person,
Pakunoda knows this.

128
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,150
If you follow his conditions,
he'll return your boss!

129
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,220
That's enough, kid...

130
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,620
Don't think you can say anything you want!

131
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,810
That's enough.

132
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,800
Let Pakunoda go.

133
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,180
You're siding with them?

134
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,430
Shal,

135
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,530
right now, what would our
worst-case scenario be?

136
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,660
The boss is already dead,

137
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,970
Pakunoda and the others are being controlled,

138
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,570
we can't find the chain user,

139
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,780
and the two kids escape...

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,030
Then, you've got it wrong.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,720
The worst-case scenario would be that
we all die and the spider perishes.

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,450
By comparison, your scenario
would be quite pleasant.

143
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,010
Am I wrong?

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,670
N-No, you're right.

145
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,610
I don't care about your reasons.

146
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,500
You're being too reliant on the boss.

147
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,540
If the Troupe falls apart as a result,

148
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,930
that's the greatest betrayal you
could make toward the boss.

149
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,360
If we keep bickering, that could well happen.

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,490
Cool off.

151
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,690
Let them have their way...

152
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,320
Pakunoda can take the kids.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,870
If the boss doesn't return,

154
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,960
we kill the members being controlled,
and start to rebuild the spider.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,890
It's extremely simple.

156
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,050
I'm fine with that.

157
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,920
If that's what it takes to satisfy you.

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,250
Well, I'm not being controlled,
and it won't be easy to kill me.

159
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,920
Hello?

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,710
Put the hostages on the phone.

161
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
Don't break it!

162
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Are you okay?

163
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,400
Are they there?

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,350
Yeah, they're all here.

165
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,850
Hey!

166
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,850
We're following your orders.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,900
Aren't you going to follow them?

168
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,430
The chain user can't monitor our location now.

169
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,490
Shut up.

170
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,230
If I give chase, you'll all stop me.

171
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,120
For now, I'll just sit and wait.

172
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,110
If the boss fails to return, I'll kill you, too.

173
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,750
Go ahead.

174
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,590
Board the waiting airship.

175
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,830
The pilot already has his orders.

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,170
As promised, it's just the three of them.

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,260
We can't be sure until the airship takes off.

178
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,530
Stay alert.

179
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,890
There's someone over there.

180
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,060
That's

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,690
Hisoka!

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,670
Hi...

183
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,190
Why are you here?!

184
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,270
Did you sneak out?

185
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,920
No need for concern...

186
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,950
I left a dummy behind.

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,100
Hurry up.

188
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,950
Without needles, I can only change
my face for four to five hours.

189
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,990
What are you up to?

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,310
Allow me on the airship with them.

191
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,620
If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua.

192
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,460
Bastard...

193
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,100
Just kidding.

194
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,540
That would be such a waste.

195
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,160
My target is the boss.

196
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,330
Once he's released, I'll get off the airship.

197
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,980
I want to fight him.

198
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,420
That's all I want.

199
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,000
Killua, place the phone next to your heart.

200
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,570
It's fine, nothing's wrong with him.

201
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,010
Okay, let's begin the exchange!

202
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,530
If you talk to or make any contact
with a Troupe member, you die.

203
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,920
Now you will get to experience the pain

204
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,540
of losing your home.

205
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,550
I've waited a long time for this moment.

206
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,780
Now...

207
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,190
Let's do this.

208
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,140
I no longer need this.

209
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,390
This won't be considered an internal spat now,

210
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,130
so you needn't hold back.

211
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,400
I see.

212
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,410
You aren't a Troupe member,
so we can talk.

213
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,370
I can't fight you.

214
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,920
Rather, I'm not worth fighting.

215
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,930
He used his Judgment Chain on my heart.

216
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,160
I can no longer use my Nen.

217
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,350
We can leave.

218
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,310
Oh...

219
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,810
Hisoka returned to the airship without fighting.

220
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,520
The leader realized that Hisoka
wasn't a Troupe member,

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,320
so he explained about my chains.

222
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm not surprised that Hisoka wasn't interested

223
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,830
in fighting someone without Nen.

224
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,010
He wasn't a Troupe member?

225
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,830
No.

226
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,460
How did you sneak out?

227
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,580
I have a friend who's good with disguises.

228
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,210
Don't worry.

229
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,840
I no longer have any reason to kill Chrollo.

230
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,550
I'm not interested in broken toys.

231
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,850
"You can slip out now..." There.

232
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,960
That's right.

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,350
My real fortune mentioned

234
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,320
I would have a date with the boss on Tuesday.

235
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,890
And when I left,

236
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,490
the Troupe was supposed to be
down to half its members.

237
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,320
Fate appears to be changing, bit by bit.

238
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm sorry for putting you in danger.

239
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,290
Nah...

240
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,410
You used your chains on the boss, right?

241
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, but...

242
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,030
This isn't the end.

243
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,020
Meow.

244
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,860
Where's the boss?

245
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,380
He won't be coming here.

246
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,530
Don't mess with me.
Explain yourself!

247
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,510
Depending on your response...

248
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,560
Don't worry.

249
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,280
In return...

250
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,230
I can only shoot six bullets at once.

251
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,090
That's enough for the
remaining founding members.

252
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,040
Feitan.

253
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,290
Phinks.

254
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,290
Machi.

255
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,300
Nobunaga.

256
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,550
Shalnark.

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,800
Franklin.

258
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,060
Do you trust me?

259
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,310
Paku, you can't mean to...

260
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,170
Hey, are you being controlled by—

261
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,810
Phinks!

262
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,390
Have some faith.

263
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,940
It's Paku.

264
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,450
My memories...

265
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,160
My feelings...

266
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,580
I pass them all to you.

267
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,930
Please...

268
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,750
Let all this

269
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,720
end with me...

270
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,840
Paku.

271
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,530
She's dead.

272
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,300
What's going on?

273
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,490
Let me explain.

274
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,890
I understand everything.

275
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,700
Pakunoda was...

276
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,770
I hope Kurapika's fever doesn't break.

277
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,370
Yeah...

278
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,820
Wait, did you just say what I think you said?

279
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,500
Kurapika shouldn't fight the Troupe anymore.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,440
I thought of something when Kurapika
told me about his powers.

281
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,910
If he'd just wanted revenge,

282
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,250
he would have chosen different abilities.

283
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,190
Really?

284
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,690
If he'd only wanted to kill them,

285
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,580
he wouldn't have gone to the
trouble of chaining their hearts.

286
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,950
Maybe if he only had one target.

287
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,750
But Kurapika's dealing with the entire Troupe.

288
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,010
Even if he captures one,
he can't kill them right away.

289
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,670
And he needs to extract information
about the other members.

290
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,730
Oh...

291
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,130
Personally,

292
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,050
I think his powers were meant
specifically for revenge.

293
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
Oh...

294
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,400
But that was his original objective.

295
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,280
Kurapika is different now.

296
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,360
I have good friends...

297
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,630
But you do have a point.

298
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,050
I'd prefer him to stay still for a while.

299
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,370
If their boss doesn't come back,

300
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,390
they'll be even more
determined to find Kurapika.

301
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,540
Yeah.

302
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,970
We'll have to be extremely careful

303
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,170
when we go to the auction house.

304
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,080
So, do you really have a plan for
obtaining a copy of Greed Island ?

305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,200
Your plan is all we have to go on!

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,330
Y-Yeah, but it's a fifty-fifty deal.

307
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,180
Originally, didn't you say it had
a seventy percent chance?

308
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,680
I get it... That's clever.

309
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,800
Actually, that may be our only shot.

310
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,170
Realistic and sound.

311
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,050
I think it has an eighty percent chance!

312
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,690
Really?

313
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,070
Yeah, we can make it work!

314
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,570
The auction is in Hall B.

315
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,450
That way. Over there.

316
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,060
Wow!

317
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,920
Huh?

318
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,700
Why are they here?

319
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,720
How would I know?!

320
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,030
Hey, that was cold.

321
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,470
No need to run away.

322
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,390
Why wouldn't we run away?

323
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,860
Don't worry.

324
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,410
We're not going to kill you.

325
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,440
Because we can't kill the chain user now.

326
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,020
Huh? What do you mean?

327
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,310
Huh?

328
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,890
Didn't he use his chains on the boss?

329
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,990
That means we can't kill him.

330
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,020
Why not?

331
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,030
Isn't it the other way around?

332
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,140
It's pretty useful to have someone
who's willing to ask questions.

333
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,540
Nen doesn't necessarily disappear after death.

334
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,010
Nen that's driven by hatred and regret
can persist a long time after death.

335
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,550
That Nen will direct itself toward
the target of those emotions.

336
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,860
Since the boss can no longer use Nen,

337
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,060
he could be overwhelmed by that assault.

338
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,690
Residual Nen can be quite fearsome.

339
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,440
That's why we can't kill the chain user.

340
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm talking too much?

341
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,490
I know.

342
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,230
I won't say another word.

343
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,450
There are Nen users

344
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,570
who can remove other people's Nen.

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,460
East, huh...

346
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,120
So, we're done with you kids.

347
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,360
We just came to enjoy the auction.

348
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,470
The other members wanted to go home.

349
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,770
Um, what happened to Pakunoda-san?

350
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,980
She died.

351
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,230
Huh?

352
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,480
Oh...

353
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,730
Why don't you run away?

354
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,010
Run away?

355
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,610
Given my injuries, you should
be able to escape.

356
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,660
If you did, I would lose my leverage,

357
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,260
and the chain user could kill the boss.

358
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,200
So why don't you run away?

359
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,750
Aren't you on his side?

360
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,870
Because we're his friends.

361
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,210
Because we're his friends,
we don't want him to kill.

362
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,970
So we'd prefer this to be
settled with an exchange.

363
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,470
What's wrong?

364
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,760
Let's go.

365
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,360
Paku...

366
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,420
Paku wanted to thank you.

367
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,120
Next week, the story moves
into the Greed Island arc.

368
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,150
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

369
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

370
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

371
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

372
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

373
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

374
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

375
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

376
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:20,080
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

377
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,230
Today, we introduce Chrollo.

378
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,980
Boss of the Phantom Troupe.

379
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,380
The Phantom Troupe's boss.

380
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,330
A Specialist.

381
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,610
He's a Specialist.

382
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,370
He can steal and use
others' powers,

383
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,900
He can steal other people's powers for himself,

384
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
using his Skill Hunter!

385
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,080
an appropriate ability
for a bandit.

386
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,170
But conditions have to be met.

387
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,460
East, huh...

388
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,340
Next time: Bid x And x Haste.

389
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,480
A bid in haste makes waste.

390
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,300
Hey!

391
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,220
That's no good...
