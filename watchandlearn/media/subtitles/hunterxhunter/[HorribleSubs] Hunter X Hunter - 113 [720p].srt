2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,520
The King!

3
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,020
An x Indebted x Insect

4
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,630
Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.

5
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,670
The central stairway was destroyed,

6
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,180
with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend.

7
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,140
Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron,

8
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,070
who had barely managed to
make it to the second floor.

9
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,280
Below,

10
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,610
the ones hit at closest range
by Youpi's attack were Shoot...

11
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,290
This is bad.

12
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,040
My leg's destroyed.

13
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,400
Shoot!

14
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
...and Morel.

15
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,220
The rest is up to you.

16
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,640
Knuckle...

17
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,380
He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.

18
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
Stupid tricks!

19
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,950
One attack by Youpi

20
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,220
tore apart the Deep Purple puppets,

21
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,190
but Morel had deliberately
positioned them with that in mind.

22
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,240
They were just decoys?

23
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,240
That resistance...

24
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,990
This is more than smoke!

25
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,000
The weapon was the only
thing that wasn't smoke?

26
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,510
Fool! You won't get away!

27
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,950
After using his own weapon as a decoy,

28
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,020
Morel had no option left but to run.

29
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
But...

30
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,750
Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.

31
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,220
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!

32
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,040
That...

33
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,140
That punch was meant to send
him flying over the horizon.

34
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,790
The total is 590?

35
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,670
Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...

36
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,070
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage

37
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,830
in the form of interest as time progresses
from the activation of the ability.

38
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,320
Lost sight of him...

39
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,420
Damn you!

40
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,260
The enraged Youpi

41
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,900
returned to his senses because his multiple
eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.

42
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,150
With his right leg broken,

43
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,330
Shoot unconsciously used his remaining
leg to stand on one of his own fists.

44
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,800
Despite that he had never attempted it before,

45
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.

46
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,710
And he had no clear reason
to cover his right eye.

47
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,580
He was just enjoying the fact

48
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,970
that he continued to gain strength
while the situation deteriorated.

49
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,960
Fueled by adversity itself,

50
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,450
Shoot took flight.

51
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,510
His tremendous speed and vigor

52
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,910
succeeded in forcing Youpi to
concentrate on defense for a few seconds.

53
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,590
All in order

54
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,270
to help the others.

55
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,390
Shoot, Knuckle...

56
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,320
Once we finish this, first thing we do
is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol.

57
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,740
That's the only way I can get you guys
to let me give you a big hug.

58
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,650
The debris cloud raised by the destruction

59
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,220
was the perfect cover for Morel to expand
his smoke aura throughout the palace

60
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,600
so he could monitor the course of the battle.

61
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,170
Morel's objective was the throne room.

62
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,740
When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,

63
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,140
Gon and Killua evaded the attack
and changed direction.

64
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,990
They planned to jump from

65
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,080
the east tower's second floor to the central
tower's third floor, where the throne room was.

66
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,230
Upon hitting the ground, they passed
Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed

67
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,120
for the elevator underground.

68
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,690
His ability that let him control corpses
like part of his own body,

69
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,380
Living Dead Dolls, granted him
the use of multiple sets of eyes,

70
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,730
which had allowed him to
dodge Dragon Dive unscratched.

71
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,630
In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted

72
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,550
two soldier Ants in the direction

73
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,370
that Ikalgo was headed.

74
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,130
In the next moment, Killua had taken off.

75
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,740
Killua?

76
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,260
Why is he heading toward the elevator?

77
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,990
What am I doing?

78
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,130
What's wrong with me?

79
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,790
It was only natural that Killua would
be surprised by his own actions.

80
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,870
He was the one

81
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,500
who had instructed the others
to stick to their own tasks.

82
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,520
At that point, Killua's mind completely froze.

83
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,280
However, while his mind panicked,

84
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,630
his body continued to move efficiently,

85
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,870
keeping aura usage to a minimum,

86
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,030
while swiftly and accurately

87
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,720
gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities
and movements, and halting them.

88
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,780
Only Ikalgo and one other
saw what had happened.

89
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,970
Damn...

90
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,510
What have I

91
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,290
done?

92
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,030
Killua,

93
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,030
I owe you one.

94
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,980
After he realized what he'd done,
a tangle of emotions

95
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,270
had left Killua lost in confusion,

96
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,820
until Ikalgo's words woke him.

97
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,890
By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,

98
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,960
Killua was already moving on.

99
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,740
Flutter?

100
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,240
Something's wrong.

101
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:13,520
At either end of the hall leading to the
elevator underground were the servant quarters,

102
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,600
which soldier Ants currently occupied.

103
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,

104
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,010
and at the moment when he reached the elevator,

105
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,670
the doors at both ends opened simultaneously.

106
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,280
From the doors appeared...

107
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,970
Cheetu...

108
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,440
Brovada!

109
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,560
After seeing Flutter,

110
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,580
Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled
that something was wrong.

111
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,870
That was too fast.

112
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,800
Once they spotted the enemy,
the two soldiers raised an alert.

113
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,520
Right afterward, they were killed.

114
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,180
The time between the intruder's
return down the hallway

115
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,220
and Flutter's appearance was too short!

116
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,070
Which means they must have passed
one another in the hallway.

117
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,250
Then why were the soldiers killed,

118
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,000
but not Flutter?

119
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,070
Is Flutter on the enemy's side?

120
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,540
Meaning...

121
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,860
He's a traitor!

122
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,560
Is he acting on his own, or...

123
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,140
Is it Hagya's... Or rather...

124
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,670
Leol's orders?

125
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,380
This is pathetic.

126
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,130
When he needed me most, I wasn't there.

127
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,860
And I call myself a Royal Guard?

128
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,760
I don't even know where the King is.

129
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,230
And I call myself a Royal Guard?

130
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,680
No.

131
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,970
I am a failure!

132
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,760
It's that simple...

133
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,390
Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.

134
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,960
The ideals he prioritized were
unyielding and absolute.

135
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,460
Pouf, the former Royal Guard.

136
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,350
Now, Pouf...

137
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,810
Useless Pouf...

138
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,720
You utter fool.

139
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,610
You failure of a Royal Guard!

140
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,980
Where will you go now?

141
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,090
You have no idea?

142
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,840
And if the King isn't there,

143
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,990
then you'll be more useless
than scum, won't you?

144
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,980
No, useless Pouf...

145
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,310
You just refuse to accept reality.

146
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,650
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!!!!

147
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,930
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!

148
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,760
His emotions were directed at
the King as well as himself.

149
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,520
An absolute King,

150
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,530
feeling concern for a lowly human...

151
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,470
Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...

152
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,770
It is unforgivable!

153
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,200
But...

154
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,180
That's probably where the King is...

155
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,260
Before I came here, I knew that much.

156
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,640
I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because
I didn't know the King's location.

157
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,210
I failed because I knew where,
and I didn't go there!

158
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,180
Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum.

159
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,700
You are now a mere bug!

160
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,760
You can no longer expect anything of yourself.

161
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,790
Nor are you allowed, then,
to expect anything of the King!

162
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,280
I can only work for the King...

163
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,200
For the King... For the King...
For the King... For the King...

164
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,200
For the King! For the King! For the King!

165
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,330
For the King!

166
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,850
For the King!

167
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,210
Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism,

168
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,990
prevented him from thinking clearly in the
seconds after he arrived in the throne room.

169
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,410
I must go to the King.

170
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,480
Yo.

171
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,740
You're gonna ignore me?!

172
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,660
He goes straight to the King without a glance.

173
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,740
Unfortunately, you've been surrounded.

174
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,000
What must I do

175
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,460
to have you let me out?

176
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,260
Oh, I'm not letting you out.

177
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,250
I see...

178
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,160
Spiritual Message
Love Spring of Moth Scales

179
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,580
Spiritual Message.

180
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,390
That's Morel's Smoky Jail...

181
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,470
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.

182
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,640
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,

183
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,710
the King and Pitou aren't there.

184
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,650
Where are they?

185
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,560
Gon was raring to fight.

186
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,710
Next time: Divide x And x Conquer.

187
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,840
No, I don't wanna leave you!

188
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,010
It's okay! We're connected
by an invisible bond!

189
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,720
There you go again—

190
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,340
Two sides of the same coin.

191
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,060
Two peas in a pod!
