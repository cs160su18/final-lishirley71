2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,800
What?

10
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,050
Are you serious about this?

11
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,030
Dead serious.

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,340
Those who win will join
the ranks of the Hunters.

13
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,810
Can't Win x And x Can't Lose

14
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,820
Nine applicants:

15
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,070
Gon, Killua, Kurapika,

16
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,200
Leorio, Pokkle, Bodoro,

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,210
Gittarackur, Hanzo, and Hisoka,

18
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,240
head to the Final Phase, having passed
the exam's Fourth Phase.

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,040
Well, gentlemen.

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,210
Did you get plenty of rest?

21
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,390
This hotel is owned by the
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,220
The place is all yours until the
battles have concluded.

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,110
For the Final Phase, we will be
holding a one-on-one tournament.

24
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,630
So only the last person standing passes?

25
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,360
No.

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,120
One win is all you need to pass.

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,580
One win?

28
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,870
Then, in this tournament...

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,430
The winners are removed from competition,

30
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,810
while the losers continue up the bracket.

31
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,620
In other words, the person who
finishes at the top will not pass.

32
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,260
Does everyone understand now?

33
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,510
So you're saying that only
one person will fail.

34
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,300
Exactly.

35
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,360
And here is the bracket.

36
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,130
Impressive, right?

37
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,850
After all, everyone has at least
two chances to win.

38
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,380
But some people,

39
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,190
like #294 and #405, get five chances.

40
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,200
Why didn't you use a balanced bracket?

41
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,700
A question that must be on everyone's mind.

42
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,060
This bracket was assembled
based on your performances

43
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,080
throughout the entire exam.

44
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:35,460
Those who performed better
received more chances.

45
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,710
That doesn't sound right.

46
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,210
Can you explain how you
scored our performances?

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,670
No!

48
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,220
Why not?

49
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,820
Your scores are classified information.

50
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,060
So I can't tell you everything.

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,730
But I can explain our methods.

52
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,000
First, we consider three major criteria:

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,330
physical strength, mental strength,

54
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,700
and overall impression.

55
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,000
For physical strength, we use
an aggregate of agility,

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,210
flexibility, endurance, and perception.

57
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,800
For mental strength, we use
an aggregate of resilience,

58
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,300
adaptability, judgment, and creativity.

59
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,010
However, this information is only
used as a reference point.

60
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,830
After all, you were strong enough

61
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,050
to advance to the Final Phase.

62
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,140
However, we are most concerned
with your overall impression.

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,350
This refers to any intangible factors

64
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,400
not previously mentioned.

65
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,650
You could consider this

66
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,660
an evaluation of your potential as a Hunter.

67
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,930
And we also incorporate the
opinions of your peers.

68
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,170
That was our process.

69
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,820
Based on performance,
I should be ranked higher...

70
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,600
Do I have less potential than Gon?

71
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,140
The battle rules are quite simple.

72
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,470
Weapons are allowed.

73
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,670
No cheating.

74
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,370
If your opponent admits defeat, you win.

75
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,440
However!

76
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,560
If you kill your opponent,

77
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,140
you will be immediately disqualified.

78
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,800
All remaining applicants will pass,
and the exam will end.

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Are we clear?

80
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,030
Then, we shall begin the exam's Final Phase.

81
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,860
The first match is Hanzo versus Gon.

82
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,310
Please step forward.

83
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,290
I will serve as the referee.

84
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,540
My name is Masta.

85
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,550
Best of luck.

86
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,890
Hey, good to see you again.

87
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,590
You were tailing me during the Fourth Phase.

88
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,280
You noticed?

89
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,440
Naturally...

90
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,850
I'm assuming that each applicant was
assigned an examiner for the Fourth Phase.

91
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,750
Well, I'm sure everyone else noticed.

92
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,610
I had no idea.

93
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,860
I obviously noticed.

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,210
I thought it wasn't worth mentioning.

95
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,610
Y-Yeah...

96
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,110
How was I supposed to notice that?

97
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,940
You have my thanks.

98
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,710
My rank was higher because your
reports on me were accurate.

99
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,590
Though the outcome was never in doubt!

100
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,550
Y-Yes...

101
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,630
Moving on,

102
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,030
I have a question for you.

103
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,880
What is it?

104
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,010
We only win if our opponent
surrenders, correct?

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,660
It doesn't count if we knock them unconscious.

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,500
No TKOs allowed, either.

107
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,520
Yes, that is correct.

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,270
I see.

109
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,170
This one could be difficult...

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,990
He looks tough, but we should be even

111
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,780
in terms of strength and speed.

112
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,030
I can use my speed to keep on the
move until I get an opening.

113
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,280
Now then, it's time to begin.

114
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,290
Get him, Gon!

115
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,290
How well can he do against Hanzo?

116
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,050
Begin!

117
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,060
Put some distance between us...

118
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,440
You must be confident in your legs.

119
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
You have my respect.

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,240
You did well for a kid.

121
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,410
Tsk.

122
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,210
I could have easily dodged that attack.

123
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,230
Well, this would already be over
if it were a normal fight...

124
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,390
Here, wake up.

125
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,040
You must feel terrible.

126
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,550
I hit you hard enough to make
your brain bounce around.

127
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,460
Do you understand?
You have no chance against me.

128
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,690
Might as well give up now...

129
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,030
No way...

130
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
Think about it.

131
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,420
If you surrender now, you'll still be in
decent shape for your next fight.

132
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,290
There's no reason to be stubborn.

133
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,480
Just surrender.

134
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,430
Never gonna happen!

135
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,650
Surrender.

136
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,640
Gon! Don't be silly!

137
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,910
You'll still have another chance!

138
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,500
You should...

139
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,410
Leorio!

140
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,790
If you were in Gon's position,
would you surrender?

141
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,530
Hell, no!

142
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,670
That guy thinks he's hot stuff...

143
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,670
Gon feels the same way!

144
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,260
I know! I know that...

145
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,020
But there isn't any other choice!

146
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,350
You're contradicting yourself,

147
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,070
but I understand how you feel!

148
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,730
Yield this fight, Gon!

149
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,770
It's suicide!

150
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,780
Honestly, the chairman's nasty
streak is in a class all its own.

151
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,510
What do you mean?

152
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,730
The applicants who've made it this far

153
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,290
are unlikely to simply surrender.

154
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,290
True.

155
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,560
This goes beyond a "rather peculiar fight."

156
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,160
This system is just plain crazy.

157
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,050
That kid's in danger.

158
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:57,150
Hunter Vocabulary

159
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,150
Hanzo

160
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,420
It's been three hours.

161
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,170
There's nothing left for him to vomit.

162
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,770
Get up.

163
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,740
Enough, already...

164
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,830
I'm gonna kill you!

165
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,690
I'll fight you in his place!

166
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,360
If you can't take it, leave.

167
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,320
It's only going to get worse.

168
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,070
What was that?!

169
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,070
No one may interfere in a one-on-one match.

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,700
And if you step in, Gon will be
the one disqualified!

171
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,960
It's okay...

172
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,580
Leorio.

173
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,200
This is...

174
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,260
nothing...

175
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,970
I-I can still fight...

176
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm going to break your arm.

177
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm not joking around,

178
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,070
so give up.

179
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,540
Surrender.

180
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,140
Never!

181
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,840
He really broke his arm.

182
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,660
There you go.

183
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,350
You can't use your left arm anymore.

184
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,610
Kurapika, don't try to stop me.

185
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,610
If that bastard does anything else to Gon...

186
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,520
Sorry, Gon, but I can't stop myself.

187
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,190
Me?

188
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,020
Stop you?

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,920
Don't worry.

190
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,380
There is no chance of that happening.

191
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm sure you're in too much pain to listen,

192
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,780
but hear me out.

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,880
I am descended from the shinobi,
a clan of covert agents.

194
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,510
From the day I was born, I was forced

195
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,520
to endure harsh training in order
to master the art of ninpo.

196
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,670
For eighteen years,

197
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,360
I have trained my body and
technique, without rest.

198
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,410
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.

199
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,910
Heh, that's nothing to brag about.

200
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,730
At this point in time,
you cannot defeat me in combat.

201
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm trying to be nice.

202
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,880
Admit defeat—

203
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,550
Ow...

204
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Damn it!

205
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,600
My head's cleared a bit, after all the
pain and that long explanation.

206
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,850
Yes!

207
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,880
Gon, go!

208
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,610
Kick him while he's down!

209
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,990
If you're eighteen, you're only
six years older than I am.

210
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,260
Besides, this isn't a battle
to see who's stronger.

211
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,500
It's to see who's willing to surrender first.

212
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,090
I let you kick me on purpose.

213
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,060
Liar!

214
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,800
You don't understand...

215
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,790
This isn't a warning.

216
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,680
It's an ultimatum.

217
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,890
Was it too hard for you to understand?

218
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,060
Then I'll make it easier for you.

219
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,970
I'll cut off your legs,

220
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,320
so that they can't be reattached.

221
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,570
A permanent injury should
help to wake you up.

222
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,990
But first, I'll ask you once more.

223
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,080
Surrender.

224
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,300
I won't accept that!

225
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,440
I don't want my legs cut off,

226
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,470
but I don't want to surrender.

227
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,690
So let's find a different way to fight!

228
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,100
Hey... Do you understand
your own situation?!

229
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,110
Excuse me.

230
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,230
You don't get to make demands!

231
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,520
Are you trying to insult me?!

232
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,110
I'm seriously gonna cut off your legs!

233
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,120
But I still will not surrender.

234
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,950
Besides, if you do that,
I'll bleed to death.

235
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,350
He'll be disqualified if that happens, right?

236
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,130
Oh, yes.

237
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,740
See?

238
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,840
Neither of us wants that to happen.

239
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,380
So let's think of a better way.

240
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,640
I think he's okay now.

241
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,140
Gon's taken control.

242
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,820
He's so self-centered...

243
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,400
But he's succeeded in convincing
Hanzo and the rest of us.

244
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,250
Honestly...

245
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,980
What is this?

246
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,490
The situation hasn't changed.

247
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,160
Gon hasn't gotten stronger than his opponent.

248
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,290
His arm is still broken!

249
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,460
So why is the brutal
atmosphere from before

250
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,540
suddenly so much lighter?

251
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
You really don't get it...

252
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,020
If you die, you'll never get another chance.

253
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,470
If I kill you here,

254
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,100
I need only try again next year.

255
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,530
We are not on equal footing!

256
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,030
He's right, Gon.

257
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,180
You can try all you want
to talk your way out of this,

258
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,250
but he's far stronger than you.

259
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,190
That isn't something you can
neutralize on the spot.

260
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,290
It all comes down to power.

261
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,490
Why won't you concede?
It's easy to do.

262
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,830
You can try again next year.

263
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,870
You value your pride more
than your own life?!

264
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,700
You're really willing to die for your pride?!

265
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,710
I'm going to find my dad.

266
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,220
Your dad?

267
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,460
My dad is a Hunter.

268
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,040
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!

269
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,280
I believe that I'll find him one day...

270
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,910
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,

271
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,090
I'll never find him!

272
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,160
So I won't surrender.

273
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,250
If you don't yield, you'll die...

274
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,680
He defies reason.

275
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,190
I give up. You win.

276
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,730
I can't kill you.

277
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,050
But I can't think of a way
to make you surrender.

278
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,200
I'll take this loss and take my
chances in the next battle!

279
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,380
I can't accept that.

280
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,950
That's not fair!

281
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,210
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!

282
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,960
Heh, I knew you would say that.

283
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,510
You fool!

284
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,810
There's no point, because you'll
never surrender!

285
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,780
But I don't want to win like this!

286
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,180
What am I supposed to do?

287
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,220
We can work together to figure it out!

288
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,010
In other words, I've already
given up on this match,

289
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,490
but you want me to try to win again,

290
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,020
while helping to determine a way to
make you feel good about your victory!

291
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,240
Is that right?

292
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,370
Uh-huh!

293
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,120
You moron!

294
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,950
Hey, ref.

295
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,290
I lose. Let's move on to the next match.

296
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,510
Understood.

297
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,460
But I want to tell the executive
committee something first.

298
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,020
When he wakes up,

299
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,320
he'll probably refuse his passing judgment.

300
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,340
Because he's a stubborn boy,

301
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,810
as we've seen.

302
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,800
Only one person will fail this round, right?

303
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,020
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?

304
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,310
Gon's victory has been assured,
following Hanzo's concession.

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,660
The Final Phase, to determine
the single failing applicant,

306
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,530
has only just begun.

307
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,860
Next time: Baffling x Turn Of x Events!

308
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,530
They got Gon, too!
