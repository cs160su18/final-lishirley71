2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,850
He's so...

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,690
He's so gentle!

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,820
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,880
And providing guidance.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,450
He's telling me how to become stronger.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,500
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,130
you fight on the premise of escaping.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,590
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,030
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,020
you must leave Gon's side.

12
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,980
Interest x And x Curse

13
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,280
As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,550
Gon and Killua are deep in thought.

15
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,050
The loser...

16
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,060
Hands his token to the winner.

17
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,770
Gon...

18
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,830
As promised,

19
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,830
I'm coming at you

20
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,330
at full power!

21
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,450
If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me.

22
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,520
I have to be ready to take the hit...

23
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,340
And counterattack!

24
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,770
Don't follow him by sight.

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,250
Sense his motions...

26
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,640
Through my aura!

27
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,330
A little late, but I sensed his approach!

28
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,430
But what's going on?

29
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,620
I feel power rushing through my body...

30
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,820
It's time.

31
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,790
Adding interest.

32
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,830
Wh-What is this thing?

33
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,000
I let you borrow

34
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,570
some of my aura.

35
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,630
You let me borrow your aura?

36
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,410
By the way, I charge ten percent interest.

37
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
Ten percent

38
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,640
every ten seconds!

39
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,050
If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust.

40
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,900
It's time.

41
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,780
Adding interest.

42
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,910
I call this ability "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."

43
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,030
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens

44
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,660
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,490
That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector.

46
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,020
Attacking APR is a waste of time...

47
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,850
It'll just hang around you,
telling you when your interest goes up.

48
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,880
It's both harmless and invincible.

49
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,680
Though it can be an eyesore...

50
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,400
It's time.

51
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,950
Adding interest.

52
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,510
Again.

53
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,130
It doesn't hurt at all...

54
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,270
Instead, I feel another power rush.

55
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,190
It's time.

56
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,700
Adding interest.

57
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,150
It suddenly almost doubled?!

58
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,240
That's because I just lent you

59
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,360
another 180 aura.

60
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,420
180 aura?

61
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,860
What do these numbers mean?

62
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,930
It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,440
"180 aura" is a numeric measure
of your spiritual power.

64
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,620
Aura accumulates in the body,

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,530
and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP)

66
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,890
varies according to your training.

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Also, there is a limit on how much
aura you're able to release at once,

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,450
which can be raised through training.

69
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,830
In other words,

70
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,230
Present aura Output Potential [POP]

71
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,600
your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter.

72
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,150
If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,

73
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,450
Present aura Output Potential [POP]
Actualized aura Output Potential [AOP]

74
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,880
the amount of aura you can actually release,

75
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,740
1000 aura                                      200 aura

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,300
you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?

77
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,130
When you use Ken, you can sustain

78
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,680
a maximum 1,800 aura around your body.

79
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,140
When preparing for battle,

80
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,740
you usually expend 1 aura per second.

81
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,860
However, once the fight begins,

82
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,020
you begin to use advanced techniques such as Gyo, Ryu, and Ken,

83
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,790
which require considerable Nen.

84
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,800
This increases the rate you expend
aura by six to ten times.

85
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,650
The stronger your techniques,
the more aura you use up.

86
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,970
Got that, fool?

87
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,140
Your control is still weak,

88
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,920
so you're burning 10 aura every second.

89
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,280
That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.

90
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,530
In yesterday's fight, you ran
out after twenty minutes...

91
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,020
So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura.

92
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,530
Then add your four Jajankens!

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Your AOP is around 1,800 aura.

94
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,820
But at the moment you called out "Jan"
to activate Jajanken, the aura focused

95
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,610
in your fist was over 2,000.

96
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,990
That's due to its long charge and your defensive
sacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist.

97
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,800
A special provision covers such risks
attributed to special attacks.

98
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,700
You expended around 5,500 aura
with the first three Jajanken shots!

99
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,950
That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500.

100
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,500
As for the fourth shot...

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,190
Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy.

102
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,550
Assuming that you needed twice the
usual aura amount to complete the attack,

103
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,980
the fourth shot required 4,000 aura.

104
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,690
The amount of aura used up is
the same for Rock and Paper.

105
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,410
However, Paper falls within a different category,

106
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,160
and you haven't practiced much,

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,140
so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack.

108
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,120
That probably only had the strength
of about a 500-aura attack.

109
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,890
Thus, your maximum POP

110
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,130
is around 21,500 aura!

111
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,740
I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...

112
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,360
Looks like you're not good at math.

113
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,320
But I'm just getting started!

114
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
Listen up, fool!

115
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,250
When your borrowed aura, including interest,

116
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,210
surpasses your current remaining POP,

117
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,200
you'll bust.

118
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,610
Aura works like a bank account balance.

119
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,600
If you keep spending, your balance decreases...

120
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,150
But the interest keeps skyrocketing!

121
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,980
It's been a few minutes since we started.

122
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,570
You've used up at least 2,000.

123
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,320
Take a look.

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
It's huge!

125
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,740
That's not all...

126
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,490
It's three times what it was before?

127
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,410
That can't be right!

128
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,110
It's only been two or three minutes!

129
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,150
To be precise, it's been 120 seconds.

130
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,260
This exemplifies how interest
can snowball on you.

131
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,150
It's time.

132
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,520
Adding interest.

133
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,240
Even after adding in the

134
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,320
390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000.

135
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,740
Your debt will continue to grow.

136
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,310
Even if you stand perfectly still,

137
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,580
in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds,

138
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,820
you'll bust.

139
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,670
Bankrupt

140
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,210
What happens if I bust?

141
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,550
APR will become the
Individual Ren Suppressor,

142
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,840
and spend thirty days tracking the target.

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,060
During that time, the target will
remain in a state of Zetsu.

144
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,060
Basically, unable to use any Nen.

145
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,300
It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!

146
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,950
That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.

147
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,320
He held back for my sake...

148
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,000
Knuckle!

149
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,810
Thank you.

150
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,970
Here I come!

151
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,000
That punch just now was around 150...

152
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,090
You returned 150 to me,
but I lent you another 180.

153
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,370
The net impact is that your
loan increases by 30...

154
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,910
What will you do now?

155
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,030
Until your debt is repaid,

156
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,860
I won't take damage from your attacks.

157
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,250
It's time.

158
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,080
Adding interest.

159
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,710
Yeah, come at me, fool!

160
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,550
If you just stand around, you'll bust
after the four minutes expire!

161
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,070
You managed to land more hits.

162
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,820
But ultimately, you only returned about 100.

163
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,850
It's time.

164
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,290
Adding interest.

165
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,710
That's just a drop in the bucket.

166
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,320
You repaid less than half your
last interest payment...

167
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,400
I won't let you launch Jajanken again.

168
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,970
Once your debt passes 10,000,
my victory is assured.

169
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,990
It's time.

170
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,980
Adding interest.

171
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,650
Wh-What is that?

172
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,190
Can't let him intimidate me.

173
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,400
Neither of us knows anything
about the other's abilities!

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,540
I don't like hurting other people.

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,000
That's why I chose a power that only activates

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,050
when I must hurt someone.

177
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,060
To give myself a weapon that only works

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,960
against those I have no qualms about hurting.

179
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,760
However...

180
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,520
You boys have taught me

181
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,090
that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.

182
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,090
Three hands?

183
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,510
How?

184
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,550
They're floating?!

185
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,420
What kind of power is this?

186
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,580
Should I attack first?

187
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,890
Stay calm...

188
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,220
Observe the situation with Gyo!

189
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,360
He's not using In.

190
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,360
There are three floating hands.

191
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,860
That means,

192
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,410
most likely, he's a Manipulator.

193
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,620
That cage is also a mystery.

194
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,050
He doesn't need it if he plans to use

195
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,600
those flying hands to attack.

196
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,880
In other words...

197
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,640
Touching those hands is dangerous!

198
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,140
Yo-yos, huh?

199
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,430
Let's see what you can do.

200
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,580
He's amazingly adept...

201
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,190
He's fast!

202
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,100
Those hands were just a distraction?

203
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,100
Jump back.

204
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,980
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

205
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,610
you fight on the premise of escaping.

206
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,110
No way...

207
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,890
That's no different from what I've always done.

208
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,000
Use electricity!

209
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,500
Couldn't get the attack off!

210
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,670
My body won't listen to me...

211
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,510
This...

212
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,560
is my curse.

213
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,580
His reaction was slow.

214
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,930
Is something wrong?

215
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,300
Stop... Don't think about it.

216
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
It's my bad habit.

217
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,900
His circumstances don't matter.

218
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Do my best to defeat him.

219
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,780
Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!

220
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,410
He's strong and fast.

221
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,420
He probably has me beat in every area...

222
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,510
That's right, Killua...

223
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,670
That's the way.

224
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,840
Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.

225
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,430
I have to stop thinking that way!

226
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Your weakness is that you're
too quick to give up.

227
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,290
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,

228
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,200
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.

229
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,710
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...

230
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,910
You don't bother to think of how you could win.

231
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,950
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.

232
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,240
I realize that this isn't your fault.

233
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,190
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.

234
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,220
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.

235
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,570
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

236
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,230
Forget it.

237
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,730
You can't win.

238
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,380
My left eye?

239
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,270
The left side of my face

240
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,880
is gone...

241
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,150
That was a much better reaction.

242
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Was what happened earlier a fluke?

243
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,170
If you take damage without knowing why,

244
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,240
get as far from the enemy as you can.

245
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,890
My curse saved me.

246
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,850
But that isn't good enough!

247
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,140
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself

248
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,910
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.

249
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,410
I must fight to win!

250
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,050
I'm blind on the left side...

251
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,810
There it was again.

252
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,500
You reacted quickly.

253
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,290
No! I'm just running away!

254
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,320
I haven't been fighting at all...

255
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,320
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

256
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,280
you must leave Gon's side!

257
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,970
I'm done running away.

258
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,980
Take this...

259
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,480
Electricity?

260
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,490
Scary.

261
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,740
Doesn't matter... Follow him.

262
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,370
Never overpursue.

263
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,020
Go after him!

264
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,390
Why—

265
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,300
Stop.

266
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,640
Got it?

267
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,150
What am I asking that for?

268
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,200
While Gon and Killua

269
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,570
were fighting for the tokens...

270
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,590
Next time: The Strong x And x The Weak.

271
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,720
Here I come, Killua...

272
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,860
Time to eat!

273
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,590
Bring it!

274
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,250
My yakiniku meal.
