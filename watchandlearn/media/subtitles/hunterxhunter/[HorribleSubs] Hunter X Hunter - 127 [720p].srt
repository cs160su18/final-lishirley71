2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,690
Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,960
Meruem... That is your name.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,250
What is this?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,370
Meruem, King of Ants,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,210
you understand nothing...

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,150
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,360
I see now...

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,520
Yes... I see...

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,830
You had me in checkmate

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,330
from the start...

12
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,030
Hostility x And x Determination

13
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,860
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,

14
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,300
while also proving surprisingly lethal.

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,300
With the right technology,

16
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,490
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.

17
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,660
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,

18
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,580
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,

19
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,160
and was popular with small dictatorships.

20
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,410
In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,

21
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,830
ten times as many roses had bloomed,

22
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,540
consuming 5.12 million human lives.

23
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,580
After terrorists used the bomb in the
center of an adversarial nation's capital,

24
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,020
taking more than 110,000 lives,

25
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,410
an international treaty was signed that
banned the bomb's production.

26
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,420
However, over eighty percent of the
world's countries rejected the proposal

27
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,420
to discard and ban the use of
roses they had already produced,

28
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,920
meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds

29
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,790
still wait silently in many countries
for their chance to bloom.

30
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,240
"How are humans and Ants different?"

31
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,690
When Netero decided to use his last resort,

32
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,290
could this thought have crossed his mind?

33
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,880
Now, there is no way to find out.

34
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,010
The two immediately understood

35
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,720
what the distant cloud of smoke and
resulting vibration in the air signified.

36
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,730
At the same time,

37
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,220
Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.

38
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,320
After his experience with Youpi,

39
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,600
Knuckle hoped to reach a
similar understanding with Pouf.

40
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,390
But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.

41
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,660
If the King waves his baton,

42
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,870
the soldiers will become demons if necessary.

43
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,280
Pouf's main body must have learned
that something happened to the King.

44
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,790
That led to the transformation of the clone's
face, revealing the Ants' true nature.

45
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,910
Did the chairman defeat the King?

46
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,300
No, it doesn't matter either way...

47
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,920
In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier
that could not be overcome.

48
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,610
It's destroyed!

49
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,530
Is everyone okay?

50
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,950
This is brutal...

51
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,320
It only took them thirty minutes
to wreck the whole place.

52
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,140
That was close...

53
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,200
Ikalgo.

54
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,190
Killua!

55
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,460
Palm...

56
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,010
I see.

57
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,910
But I'm glad to see you.

58
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,480
You returned to us.

59
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,040
Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car.

60
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,450
No, she wants to stay.

61
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,170
Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight.

62
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,730
In terms of raw offensive power,
she has me beat...

63
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,080
Probably.

64
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,250
To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once.

65
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,930
However...

66
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll wait.

67
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,380
I'll respect his wishes...

68
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,170
His wishes?

69
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,350
He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.

70
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,870
I'll wait right here for one hour.

71
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,550
And once he's made up his mind,
that's it. He won't budge.

72
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,610
In return, he performs his best

73
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,160
when circumstances are as expected.

74
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,390
Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.

75
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,230
B-But what if...

76
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,170
Yeah, I know.

77
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,890
If he gets into serious trouble,
we'll immediately rush in to help him.

78
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,360
I see...

79
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,250
So that's why they're staying behind.

80
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,290
Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,

81
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,180
he still won't be able to beat Pitou.

82
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,630
In fact, even if the three of us join him,

83
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,350
they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou.

84
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,300
They're staying behind

85
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,740
to die with him!

86
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,600
We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.

87
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,220
Want to come?

88
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,220
Absolutely.

89
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,430
Okay, let's go.

90
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,930
We separated the King and the Royal Guard

91
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,360
to let the chairman defeat the King.

92
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,370
As Knov-san said, we've completed
the mission we were assigned.

93
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,370
Each of us will have to decide
where we go from here.

94
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,130
Do we stop or keep going?

95
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,510
I am

96
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,390
going to keep fighting them.

97
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,390
I've already laid down my life here more than once.

98
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,300
Even if we can't reach an understanding,

99
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,020
I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.

100
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,990
You're finished.

101
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,810
Why did he say that?

102
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,010
There's still time left...

103
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,320
Did he notice that my surgery was done?

104
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,770
I made sure to hide my progress from him.

105
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,650
But if I showed any sign of
relaxing after finishing it,

106
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,380
and he noticed that...

107
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,990
I must kill him.

108
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,910
No matter the cost!

109
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,690
I must kill him...

110
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,560
For the King's sake!

111
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,910
Did he notice my bloodlust then?

112
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,920
Stand up.

113
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,770
We move to Peijing now.

114
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
Running is faster for us.

115
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,610
What happened to me?

116
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,210
I would like to—

117
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,590
The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her.

118
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,350
S-Sorry!

119
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,100
Am I interrupting something?

120
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,100
U-Um, I don't understand what's going on...

121
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,000
I understand.

122
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,610
Let's go.

123
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,120
Pitou was close enough to take
off his head with one arm.

124
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,410
But Pitou couldn't move.

125
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,790
After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,

126
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,060
Pitou's instincts said to obey.

127
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,880
I can't make a move now...

128
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,450
My chance will come.

129
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,210
There'll be many, on our way to Peijing.

130
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,650
But I must get Komugi to the King!

131
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,330
Gon, want me to use Chapter 7
Bankruptcy on Pitou?

132
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,390
If there's an escape attempt,
I can track Pitou down.

133
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,310
And if Pitou tries to fight back,
APR will protect you.

134
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,600
Thank you, Knuckle.

135
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,740
But it's okay.

136
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,350
I trust Pitou...

137
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,110
So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,

138
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
keep an eye on her.

139
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,620
A-Are you talking about me?

140
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,680
Is he going to use Komugi...

141
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,010
As a hostage?!

142
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,520
Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go.

143
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,530
I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?

144
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,450
Pitou?

145
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,550
You sure about this, Killua?

146
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,310
You aren't going with Gon?

147
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,280
We were...

148
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,120
No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon.

149
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,070
But Gon didn't want him to come!

150
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,780
Pitou and I will go by ourselves.

151
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,070
It's okay.

152
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,260
That was always the plan.

153
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,870
And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.

154
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,660
You mean the hostage?

155
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,440
Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,

156
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,650
and Pitou managed to capture me.

157
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,240
Then Pitou would have the option
to exchange hostages.

158
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,000
Seriously...

159
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,480
What have they been through for
their minds to work this way?

160
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,980
It's all right.

161
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,690
Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,

162
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,360
I'll know immediately if something happens.

163
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,490
Besides, Pitou won't abandon her.

164
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,990
Which means that Gon is safe.

165
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't understand what's going on.

166
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,990
Where is the Supreme Leader?

167
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,200
Who are these people?

168
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,310
The heat of the explosion had
melted the rock into magma,

169
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,240
leaving a scene resembling the
mouth of an active volcano,

170
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,330
producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke

171
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,300
that prevented the living from entering.

172
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,810
Pouf!

173
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,410
I'll search inside, so I need you to
search the surrounding area.

174
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,430
It's possible that the explosion
sent the King flying.

175
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,490
I was wrong...

176
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,830
We will kill them all, with the King at our side.

177
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,200
None will be spared!

178
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,640
Your Majesty!

179
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,940
Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.

180
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
Before he could even see the truth for himself,

181
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,950
tears were already streaming down Pouf's face.

182
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,800
Your Majesty!

183
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,210
Your Majesty!

184
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,500
Next time:

185
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,340
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.

186
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,050
I never ask for anything in return.

187
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,800
Isn't that unconditional love?

188
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,680
Unparalleled joy.
