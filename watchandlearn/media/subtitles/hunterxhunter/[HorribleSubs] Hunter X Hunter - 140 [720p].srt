2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,010
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,490
When she's fixing,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,550
she must touch the target,
or her power won't work.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,330
I will save both Gon and Alluka!

6
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,040
Join Battle x And x Open Battle

7
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,680
Impossible...

8
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,090
There's no way I can remove this!

9
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,530
My power is not enough

10
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,970
to bear this burden.

11
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,840
Killua?

12
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,980
Where are you now? Are you okay?

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,690
Yeah, I'm on my way back.

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,980
How'd it go with Gon?

15
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,240
No luck.

16
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,100
When we told him about Kite,

17
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,610
there was no response on the monitors.

18
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,280
A lot of people have dropped by to talk to him.

19
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,300
But there's been no reaction.

20
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,250
Right, I understand.

21
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,840
I doubt we can heal him with normal measures.

22
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,160
Wait! Don't be too hasty, Killua.

23
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,980
As you said, Gon used a restriction
and covenant to temporarily

24
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,760
wield an immense amount of Nen, right?

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,140
Then it's best if we let a
Nen exorcist take care of it.

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,620
We can wait until we've exhausted all our
options to resort to riskier measures.

27
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,840
Oh, sorry. That didn't come out right.

28
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,530
I'm not talking about taking a crazy gamble.

29
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,760
In fact, I can guarantee Gon will be healed.

30
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,580
Let me take care of this.

31
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,540
This method isn't as risky as using a Nen exorcist.

32
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,980
But the problem is how I can get there.

33
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,550
This time, that will be the biggest challenge.

34
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,730
Wh-What do you—

35
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,100
Forgive me, Master Killua.

36
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,060
Is that you, Gotoh?

37
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,560
I can't let you continue that conversation,
on the grounds of secrecy.

38
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,030
I didn't tell him anything secret!

39
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,480
Not true.

40
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,730
You said you could guarantee Gon would be healed.

41
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,240
That was a reference to Master Alluka's power.

42
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,760
At the moment, you are still
just within Zoldyck property,

43
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,540
but outside the boundaries, you are already
at alert level 4, so please be careful.

44
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,280
So he was waiting for me to give Morel a hint?

45
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,420
You're too easy on me, Gotoh.

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,060
I do not understand what you mean.

47
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,580
Level 4...

48
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,690
Looks like I pissed off my father.

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,110
When one's outside alert level is 4,

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,400
restrictions are placed upon
what the target can do and say.

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
To enforce this restriction,

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,700
multiple butlers and family members
are assigned to monitor the target.

53
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,720
Restricted

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,620
If a restriction is violated,

55
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,580
the target will immediately be
captured and returned home,

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,600
Restricted

57
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,080
and the alert will automatically increase to level 5.

58
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,250
At level 5,

59
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,910
the moment a single step is
taken outside Zoldyck property,

60
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,510
the target is captured.

61
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,620
What's the reason?

62
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,410
The reasons are unauthorized
removal of a classified object,

63
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,300
rebelling against your parents,
and use of threatening actions.

64
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,680
Alluka's an object?

65
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,360
There are three restrictions.

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,560
First, to protect family secrets,

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,800
the target may not speak to,

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,370
or exchange items with,
any outsiders without permission.

69
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,550
To enforce this, the target is forbidden
to carry any communication devices.

70
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,470
I've already had everything taken away.

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,620
Second, to protect family secrets,

72
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,610
the target must stay within one meter
of Master Alluka at all times.

73
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,150
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,760
I don't plan on letting her out of my sight.

75
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,150
Third, to protect family secrets,

76
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,780
you are forbidden from letting any outsiders

77
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,400
learn anything about Alluka's power.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,780
I understand perfectly.

79
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,650
So basically...

80
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,160
This is what I have to do.

81
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,530
This way, I don't have to ask permission
every time I do something.

82
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,460
While we're traveling, I'll let you
handle all the arrangements!

83
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,510
I understand why I am here.

84
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,920
But why is Canary here?

85
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,250
Moron!

86
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,300
Alluka's a girl.

87
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,560
I can't trust a lump like you to take care of her!

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,060
There is nothing to worry about.

89
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,820
We shall also accompany you.

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,130
Master Silva did not believe

91
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,320
that two butlers would be enough.

92
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,020
Tsubone!

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,340
Dad really is pissed...

94
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,590
It's fine.

95
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,530
I won't do anything stupid at alert level 4.

96
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,000
Listen to me, Killua-chan.

97
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm not as lenient as your father and Gotoh.

98
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,660
A single violation, and I'll take you home.

99
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,440
Nothing will change that.

100
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,280
If you resist, I'll knock you out.

101
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,530
Keep that in mind.

102
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,220
Are we clear?

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes! Yes! Yes!

104
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,880
Tsubone-sensei is the only person

105
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,060
in the entire household who
calls Master Killua "Killua-chan."

106
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,760
No bullying Brother.

107
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,490
I'm sorry...

108
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,500
Alluka-chama is so kind.

109
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,270
I won't do it again.

110
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,530
I just realized something.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,770
I have trouble dealing with old ladies.

112
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,200
Do you love your big brother?

113
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,780
I love him lots!

114
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,700
Then you should do as he says.

115
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,540
Okay!

116
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,380
Master Killua is depending on me.

117
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,760
All so he can save his friend,

118
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,190
regardless of the risks.

119
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,830
I will help him!

120
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,290
Even if it costs me this job

121
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,290
or my life.

122
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,400
I am Amane. It's a pleasure.

123
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,410
Canary.

124
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,960
The pleasure's mine.

125
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,810
Tsubone!

126
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,610
Give me the nail of your pinky.

127
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,710
She made a request of Tsubone!

128
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,010
This is the worst time for it!

129
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,770
Even I don't know when, and of whom,
Something's requests will come.

130
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,100
Yes, absolutely.

131
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,880
Master Killua,

132
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,870
I will go into hiding for the time being.

133
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,930
This means that Master Alluka

134
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,630
will not make requests of anyone else.

135
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
Unless I change my mind.

136
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,730
Do you understand what I mean?

137
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,320
Of course, I will remain near you at all times.

138
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,640
I still have more requests...

139
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,900
She pulled a fast one!

140
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,900
It's all right.

141
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,270
I still have a chance.

142
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,920
I won't be able to make a wish,
but I can issue a command!

143
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,040
Brother, are you angry?

144
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,800
It's okay.

145
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,300
There's nothing for you to worry about.

146
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,350
I will save you!

147
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,610
Yes?

148
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,010
Yes.

149
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,990
Yes.

150
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,970
That's right.

151
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,140
This is Master Killua's phone.

152
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,740
No, I cannot answer that question.

153
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,490
I cannot answer that question, either.

154
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,120
In that case,

155
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,960
you should state your name first.

156
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,710
Goodbye.

157
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,870
Who was that?

158
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,920
It was...

159
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,640
Hello?

160
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,150
My name is Leorio!

161
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,840
Can you put Killua-kun on the phone?

162
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,910
Shh!

163
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,660
Wow, that brings back memories!

164
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,440
It has been quite some time, Master Leorio.

165
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,680
Huh?

166
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,830
Oh! I remember!

167
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,060
It's the coin guy!

168
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,120
Master Killua is currently on his way
there, accompanied by us.

169
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,310
Yes, to help Master Gon.

170
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,140
However, there are strict conditions
that must be met.

171
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,430
Hey, there...

172
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,780
Conditions to save a friend?

173
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,190
Are you dreaming?

174
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,060
If you need help waking up,
I'll speak more loudly!

175
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,760
Keep your mouth shut.

176
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,490
What did you say?

177
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,490
Master Killua is risking his life.

178
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,180
He's heading to you, against his family's wishes.

179
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,120
You should know that the Zoldyck
family is very special.

180
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,160
We are the ones who set the conditions.

181
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,810
So shut up and listen, fool.

182
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,130
Gotoh...

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,260
Please excuse me.

184
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,990
Let me talk to him.

185
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,320
It'll be faster that way.

186
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,890
Don't worry.

187
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,830
I won't say anything I'm not supposed to.

188
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,620
One violation, and I'll be sent home, right?

189
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,250
Yo, it's been a while.

190
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,650
Killua!

191
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,950
When you get here, let me talk to that guy.

192
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,450
Are you okay?

193
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,730
Yeah, but I can't say anything specific.

194
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,790
I need you to trust me.

195
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,040
Do as Gotoh says.

196
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,600
Yeah, got it.

197
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,790
Put him back on.

198
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,800
I'll ask about the conditions.

199
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,370
Let me talk.

200
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,230
Uh... Morel-san, was it?

201
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,200
This is my phone, and I'm talking to my buddy,

202
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,120
so why should I let you talk?

203
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,890
An excellent question.

204
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,050
The answer is to give me the phone.

205
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,320
No way. Get lost.

206
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,880
Very well.

207
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,450
Then, I have a favor to ask.

208
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,580
My guess is that you'll say, "That isn't possible."

209
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,080
In which case, you should hand over the phone.

210
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,660
Because I can make it possible.

211
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,960
Hello?

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,620
No, it's nothing.

213
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,470
Tell me the conditions.

214
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,470
When we arrive,

215
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,980
there must be no one inside
the building except Master Gon.

216
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,300
Not even doctors?

217
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,390
Correct.

218
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,970
Or any other patients?

219
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,950
Correct.

220
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,240
That isn't possible!

221
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,680
This is a national hospital!

222
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,230
Do you have any idea how
many people are in here?!

223
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,170
Hello?

224
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,470
I understand the conditions.

225
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,810
Leave it to me.

226
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,560
What is the plan?

227
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,050
This is a big hospital,

228
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,090
with a big parking lot.

229
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,440
We'll set up a private room for Gon there.

230
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,640
It'll be arranged so you can
drive in and out of the area.

231
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,920
I'll make sure that no one can learn

232
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,110
what you do inside.

233
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,390
Understood.

234
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
That satisfies our requirements.

235
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,530
What is your name?

236
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,510
I'm Morel.

237
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,290
From now on, I'd like you to
be the one I speak with.

238
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,790
There you go.

239
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,790
Oh, I need to make another call.

240
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,870
Knov?

241
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,630
It's me.

242
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,040
The situation's changed.

243
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,470
I need you to make sure the equipment
is operable in an outside room.

244
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,860
No, no monitors.

245
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,810
And we can't have any windows.

246
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,100
True...

247
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,160
It sounds like they have a Nen exorcist,

248
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,610
since they don't want anyone watching.

249
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,820
But Killua made it sound like something else.

250
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,780
The only Nen exorcist in the Hunter Association

251
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,330
said Gon was beyond help.

252
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,580
But Killua said he could heal him with no risks.

253
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,260
No, let's not pursue the matter.

254
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,340
Killua said to let him take care of it.

255
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,100
In the field, the rule is to listen when
a trusted friend tells you to.

256
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,450
Morel, I'll let you handle all contact with Killua.

257
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,670
Yeah, I've got it.

258
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,330
What are you going to do?

259
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,610
There are several people

260
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,890
I need to have a word with.

261
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,510
Gon's fighting for his life...

262
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,170
Where are you, and what are you doing?

263
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,560
Why won't you answer your phone,

264
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,890
Kurapika?

265
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,820
And so, the Zodiacs respect the
former chairman's wishes.

266
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,340
And we've worked diligently to maintain

267
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,670
the status quo, and we seek
to better the Association.

268
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,290
Your vote, no matter for whom
you vote, will not go to waste!

269
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,680
You can be assured of that.

270
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,220
At the same time,

271
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,130
I'm sure that some people are dissatisfied

272
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,190
with the current state of the Association,
or want to shake up the leadership.

273
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,800
However, I must ask

274
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,440
that you do not express that opinion
by refusing to cast a vote.

275
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,950
You are more than welcome to make
a speech up here, on the spot.

276
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,230
All you have to do is speak up.

277
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,280
We will never seek to smother a minority opinion.

278
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,150
We have Ging here,

279
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,340
who commits countless violations every year,

280
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,220
but still calls himself a member of the Zodiacs.

281
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,230
If you intend to skip the vote,
you might as well vote for him.

282
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,730
Ah, that was meant to be a joke.

283
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,240
This was the final mission the
former chairman gave us.

284
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,230
The entire Association should
work together to clear it!

285
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,260
Okay, thank you very much, Vice Chairman.

286
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,740
Please return to your seat.

287
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,420
Make it quick.

288
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,660
We now open the floor to everyone here.

289
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,260
If you'd like to express your views or
ask a question, raise your hand.

290
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,020
Okay, the big guy in the dark suit... Go ahead.

291
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,480
I'm Leorio, from the 287th class.

292
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,970
I have a question for that guy named Ging.

293
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,250
That's Gon's dad.

294
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,760
Why haven't you gone to visit Gon?

295
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,550
You must know his current condition!

296
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,980
Okay, let's hear the answer.

297
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,060
First, what is your relationship to Gon?

298
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,220
We're buddies.

299
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,160
Oh... I appreciate it.

300
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,660
I hope you'll stay friends with him.

301
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,950
That's all.

302
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,570
Answer my question!

303
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,320
Or just go visit him!

304
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,420
Go visit Gon!

305
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,580
I've heard he has a number of friends like you.

306
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,180
That should suffice.

307
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,090
Don't give me that bull!

308
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,840
Do you have any idea how much
Gon wants to see you?

309
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,350
If you talk to him, he might recover!

310
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,850
Did he say

311
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,100
that he wanted me to visit?

312
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,260
He couldn't say it if he wanted to...

313
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,080
You damned

314
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,740
bastard!

315
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,110
You can go to hell!

316
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,460
Wow!

317
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,590
You'll find footage of today's entire
meeting on the Hunter site,

318
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,570
so tell everyone who wasn't present!

319
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,180
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!

320
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,470
The Zoldyck family has different plans for Alluka.

321
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,840
And this man never changes.

322
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,010
Next time: Magician x And x Butler.
