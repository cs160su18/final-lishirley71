00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,890
Baffling x Turn Of x Events

10
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,990
You're awake?

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,380
Where am I?

12
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,030
A waiting room, next to the
arena for the Final Phase.

13
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,470
Upsie-daisy...

14
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,270
Right. I was in the middle
of the Hunter Exam.

15
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,880
Your arm will heal quickly.

16
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,730
The break was very clean.

17
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,240
In fact, once it heals, the bone
will be stronger than before.

18
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,050
In any case,

19
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,590
congratulations on passing the exam.

20
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,610
Satotz-san, I...

21
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,430
You can't.

22
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,650
Just as someone who has failed
the exam can no longer pass,

23
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,550
someone who has passed
the exam can no longer fail.

24
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,990
The rest is up to you.

25
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,280
If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro,

26
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,650
you are free to destroy or
put away your license.

27
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,960
You can even sell it,

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,600
since no one else will be able to use it.

29
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,130
However,

30
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:07,140
a person who has passed the exam will
not be allowed to take it again.

31
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,840
Professional Hunters are treated well,

32
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,020
largely due to our predecessors' efforts.

33
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,150
Hence, there are many applicants
who harbor ill intentions.

34
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,650
If it weren't for them,

35
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,290
we would accept every person who applied.

36
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,740
Most professional Hunters consider

37
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,850
this card more valuable than their own lives,

38
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,490
yet no more than a worthless scrap
of paper at the same time.

39
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,300
The important thing

40
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,930
is what you accomplish once
you become a Hunter.

41
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,180
What I accomplish...

42
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,940
Gon-kun,

43
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,590
you can decide for yourself when
you're ready to use this card.

44
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,430
I have faith in your judgment.

45
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,410
Okay.

46
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,830
A lot of people helped me reach this point.

47
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,340
I'll use this once I've returned the favor.

48
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,320
Then allow me to congratulate you.

49
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,720
Thank you, Satotz-san.

50
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,760
What about the other applicants?

51
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,720
The exam is still going on, right?

52
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,230
No, the exam is over.

53
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,530
Really?

54
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,410
Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day.

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,300
Really?

56
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,050
The others who passed are currently
completing a brief orientation.

57
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,770
You will undergo the orientation later.

58
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,620
Who failed?

59
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,870
It was

60
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,220
Killua.

61
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,130
Why did Killua fail?

62
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,470
First, let me fill you in on what transpired

63
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,420
after you were knocked out.

64
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,020
That will help you understand
what occurred.

65
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,350
After you fell unconscious...

66
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,410
When he wakes up, he'll probably
refuse his license.

67
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,540
That sounds like something Gon would do.

68
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,970
Only one person will fail this round, right?

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,420
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Don't worry. Gon has passed.

71
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,410
Nothing he says can change that.

72
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,750
If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me,

73
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,420
we still wouldn't be able
to revoke his license.

74
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,800
Very well.

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,950
Why did you let him win?

76
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,080
Let him win?

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,710
I'm sure you knew how to make Gon
surrender without killing him.

78
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,330
Given your skills.

79
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,690
When I torture someone,

80
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,470
I expect that person to hate me
for the rest of their life.

81
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,850
It's more effective and less stressful.

82
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,890
When someone is in pain,

83
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,600
their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward
the one responsible for that pain.

84
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,370
Even with extensive training,

85
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,980
it is difficult to suppress
that gleam of hate and rage.

86
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,240
But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes.

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,060
Can you believe it?

88
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,480
I had just broken his arm.

89
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,210
But his eyes had already
forgotten about that.

90
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,880
I guess you could say that he won me over.

91
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,630
If you need a reason, there you go.

92
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,140
Gon-kun, you were able to
win over your opponent.

93
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,240
Hanzo said so himself.

94
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,520
After that, the second match began.

95
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,280
The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka.

96
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,030
Begin!

97
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,160
After the two of them fought for a while...

98
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,310
Wha—

99
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,580
I lose.

100
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,300
Huh?

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,650
And Kurapika won.

102
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,310
What did Hisoka say?

103
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,890
I don't know,

104
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,060
but Hisoka voluntarily conceded.

105
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,570
The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle.

106
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,280
Pokkle found himself in much
the same position as you,

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,570
but he admitted defeat immediately.

108
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,560
Sorry, but I won't go easy on you.

109
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,210
That sealed the deal.

110
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,960
The fourth match was between
Hisoka and Bodoro.

111
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,640
The match was extremely one-sided,

112
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,150
but Bodoro refused to give up.

113
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,580
However, while Bodoro
was lying on the floor,

114
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,010
Hisoka whispered something in his ear.

115
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,760
And Bodoro surrendered.

116
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,540
The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle,

117
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,420
but as soon as the fight began,
Killua walked away.

118
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,660
Confidently, he declared...

119
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,050
Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you.

120
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,300
He must have felt that he
could win his next match.

121
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,180
However,

122
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,150
Leorio requested that the sixth match

123
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,270
be postponed while Bodoro
recovered from his injuries.

124
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,530
So Killua and Gittarackur fought first.

125
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,530
Begin!

126
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,260
That was when Killua made a fatal mistake.

127
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,300
It's been too long, Kil.

128
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,640
Brother...

129
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:48,140
Hunter Vocabulary

130
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,140
Illumi

131
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,340
Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?

132
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,480
Yes, his name is Illumi.

133
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,830
Hey.

134
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,930
Killua's brother?

135
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,660
He used those needles to change
the shape of his face?!

136
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,670
I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki.

137
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,050
I guess.

138
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,800
Mom was crying.

139
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,180
Anyone would cry if their
son did that to them.

140
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,830
Tears of joy.

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,940
She was so happy to see that you'd grown up.

142
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,690
But she was worried about you leaving home,

143
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,270
so she asked me to check up on you.

144
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,440
What a coincidence.

145
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,470
I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter.

146
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,810
I'm trying to get a license for my next job.

147
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,590
I don't really want to be a Hunter.

148
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,710
I just felt like taking the exam.

149
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,530
I see...

150
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,700
That's a relief.

151
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,500
Then I have some advice for you.

152
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,440
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

153
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,790
You were born to be...

154
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,650
a killer.

155
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,580
Is that really what he said?

156
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,640
Killua mentioned his family before,

157
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,270
but they sound crazy...

158
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,120
He wasn't finished yet.

159
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
You're a puppet of darkness, without passion.

160
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,120
You don't want anything or wish for anything.

161
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,260
As one who lives in the shadows,

162
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,660
you can only feel pleasure

163
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,140
when people die.

164
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,080
That's how Dad and I raised you.

165
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,270
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?

166
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,200
True,

167
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,150
I don't desire to become a Hunter.

168
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,290
But...

169
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,660
I do have something I want...

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,700
You don't.

171
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,660
I do!

172
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,720
There's something I really want!

173
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,540
Tell me what it is that you want.

174
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,180
What's wrong?

175
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,300
There's nothing you really want, is there?

176
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,420
That's not it!

177
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,200
I want to become friends with Gon...

178
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm sick of killing people...

179
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,440
I want to become friends with Gon,

180
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,340
and to live a normal life...

181
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,330
That's impossible.

182
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,820
You'll never be able to make friends.

183
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,910
Your only concern when you meet someone
is whether you should kill them.

184
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,220
That's how you were trained.

185
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,130
You just don't know how to classify Gon

186
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,360
because he's too dazzling for your eyes.

187
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,660
You don't actually want to
become friends with him.

188
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,230
You're wrong...

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,600
If you stay with him,

190
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,360
you'll end up wanting to kill him one day.

191
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,870
You'll get the urge to see if
you can kill him or not.

192
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,290
Because you have the soul of a killer.

193
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,650
As we mentioned before...

194
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,250
Yeah, I know!

195
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,130
Killua!

196
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,800
I don't give a damn if he's your brother.

197
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,910
He's a worthless piece of crap!

198
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,300
Don't listen to him!

199
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,220
Just beat the crap out of
him like usual and win!

200
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,020
You want to become friends with Gon?

201
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,190
Are you daft?

202
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,810
You already are friends!

203
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm sure that's how Gon feels!

204
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,700
Really?

205
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,200
Hell, yeah, idiot!

206
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,360
Really... That's no good.

207
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,270
He considers Kil a friend.

208
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,250
Okay, I'll kill Gon.

209
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,460
A killer doesn't need any friends.

210
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,570
They'll only slow you down.

211
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,840
Where is he?

212
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,960
P-Please wait!

213
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,410
The match is still...

214
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,650
Where is he?

215
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,740
The waiting room over there...

216
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,650
Thank you.

217
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,200
This won't do.

218
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,420
I need a Hunter license to do my job...

219
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,190
But if I kill them, I'll fail,

220
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,840
and Kil will pass automatically.

221
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,190
Oh, darn. The same thing
will happen if I kill Gon.

222
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,060
I know!

223
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,190
I'll pass the exam before killing Gon.

224
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
Bastard...

225
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,710
If I wait until after passing the exam,

226
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,990
I can kill everyone here and
still keep my license, right?

227
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,620
Yes, according to the rules.

228
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,490
Did you hear that, Kil?

229
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,250
You have to beat me if
you want to save Gon.

230
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,290
Will you fight me for your friend's sake?

231
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,280
You can't do it.

232
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,190
Because you're more worried

233
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,140
about whether or not you can defeat me.

234
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,900
And you already have your answer:

235
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,460
"I'm not strong enough to beat my brother."

236
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,080
"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."

237
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,790
I drilled that into you...

238
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,410
Don't move!

239
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,010
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.

240
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,740
And if our bodies make contact,

241
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,570
that will also mean the fight has begun.

242
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,450
There's only one way to stop me.

243
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,550
You know what that is.

244
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,060
But don't forget...

245
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,310
If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die.

246
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,970
Take him out, Killua!

247
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,570
We won't let him kill you or Gon!

248
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,450
We'll stop him, whatever it takes!

249
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,930
Let him have it!

250
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,840
I surrender.

251
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,590
I lose...

252
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,330
Oh, that's good!

253
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,230
Then the battle's over.

254
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,520
I lied, Kil.

255
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,410
I was lying about killing Gon.

256
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,870
That was just a little test.

257
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,990
But now I have my answer.

258
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,980
You don't have the right to make friends.

259
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,990
Nor do you need friends.

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,260
You should just listen to Dad and me,
and do your job as you always have.

261
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,710
When the time comes,

262
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,010
I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam.

263
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,230
You don't need a license yet.

264
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,560
After that, he was reduced
to a shell of himself.

265
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,930
Leorio and Kurapika tried to help,

266
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,020
but he wouldn't respond.

267
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,020
The sixth match was between
Leorio and Bodoro.

268
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Bodoro had recovered,
but when the match began...

269
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,650
Begin!

270
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,140
It was over in a second.

271
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,770
Killua had killed Bodoro.

272
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,150
The committee disqualified him.

273
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,230
Gon-kun!

274
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,050
Where is everyone?

275
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,240
You need more rest, Gon-kun...

276
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,510
Gon.

277
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,150
Apologize to Killua!

278
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Gon was angry.

279
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,160
Illumi had trampled on

280
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,660
his brother's desire to become
friends with Gon,

281
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,170
abandoning Killua to despair.

282
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,260
And Gon was angry.

283
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,590
Next time: Some x Brother x Trouble!

284
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,640
Do Leorio and I look alike?

285
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,990
Get out of here...
