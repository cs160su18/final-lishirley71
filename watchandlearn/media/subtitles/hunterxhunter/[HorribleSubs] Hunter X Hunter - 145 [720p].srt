00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,560
Please help save Gon!

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,340
Use your heads!

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,920
If you have an idea, take action!

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,280
If there's something I can do, tell me.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,910
I'll do anything!

7
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,990
Defeat x And x Reunion

8
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,000
The results of the eighth chairman election

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,270
were promptly counted by Beans.

10
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,510
Now, please take a look at the result of
the eighth election for the 13th chairman!

11
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,890
Wow!

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,770
Eighth Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Leorio 282 (44.4%)
2) Pariston 250
3) Mizaistom 58
4) Cheadle 16
Turnout: 95.4%

13
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,380
This puts Leorio in first place!

14
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,670
For the first time, Pariston hasn't
finished in first place...

15
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,820
However, the first place vote-getter, Leorio,
received only 44.4% of the vote.

16
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,240
That was below the 50% requirement,

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,540
which means we'll finally have a run-off
between the top two vote-getters.

18
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,290
Are they serious about this?

19
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,410
Then I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want.

20
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,850
Oh, it's Brother.

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,750
Morning.

22
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,390
Did you sleep well?

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,850
Uh-huh.

24
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,810
Where are we?

25
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,390
The hospital.

26
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,680
My friend is here, sleeping. He's very sick.

27
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,330
I want to help get him

28
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,930
on his feet again.

29
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,250
You want Something to take over.

30
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,980
Boo! Just when I was able to spend time with you!

31
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,110
Don't worry.

32
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,890
Like I told you...

33
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,750
We'll be together from now on.

34
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,340
And that's a promise.

35
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,630
Please help me.

36
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,460
I knew it.

37
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,400
Killua is the one person who doesn't
have to follow the rules.

38
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,200
Though I'll have to check

39
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,960
whether it's specific to Killua or something
that happens after a wish is used to heal.

40
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,910
Okay, I'll do it.

41
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,640
Either way, the power to destroy and fix

42
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,000
can become a powerful tool
if the user can be tamed.

43
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,440
His utter lack of humanity and wicked ambition

44
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,560
deviate even from the path of an assassin.

45
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,620
How tragic...

46
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,270
When he was being controlled, he suffered less.

47
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,650
Alluka is only awake when Something is asleep.

48
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,930
She spends less time as Alluka than one would think.

49
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,980
The time after Something's requests
aren't met and people die,

50
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,860
until Something makes the next level-1 request...

51
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,660
Or the time when request-making is paused
after someone leaves Something

52
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,830
before her three requests are complete...

53
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,860
Or the time after Something fixes and falls asleep,

54
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,210
until someone else makes a wish
to Alluka and has it granted...

55
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,910
Making this the last wish and never
wishing to Something again

56
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,630
would be the best thing that could happen.

57
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,280
Hand... Hand...

58
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,150
Please,

59
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,820
Something...

60
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,200
Please heal Gon!

61
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,500
'Kay.

62
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,590
Such incredible power...

63
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,050
What's happening inside?

64
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,000
Who's doing this?

65
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,830
What is this?

66
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,830
I've never felt anything like this before.

67
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,310
Are you serious? Are you serious?

68
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,260
Then I'm going to do whatever I want.

69
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,750
Magnificent.

70
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,910
I want this.

71
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,780
This...

72
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,020
belongs to me.

73
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,890
Then let me ask the two remaining candidates

74
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,030
if they have anything they want to say.

75
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,040
If not, we will proceed with the final vote.

76
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,000
It's futile.

77
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,800
It doesn't matter what you have to say.

78
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,500
Well, I have a feeling that
this election is already over,

79
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,050
but I would like to ask Leorio-san a question.

80
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,310
Can you answer this question for me again?

81
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,680
What will you do if you become chairman?

82
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,290
Leorio-san, can you please
give us your answer again?

83
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,000
What will you do if you become chairman?

84
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,820
Save Gon!

85
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,570
And I'll make all of you help me!

86
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,530
That's all.

87
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,150
This would have been the perfect time,

88
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,320
but I'm not God.

89
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,780
In that case, do you have any
plans for shuffling personnel

90
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,000
or restructuring the organization?

91
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,260
Of course not!

92
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I don't even know why I'm
standing here right now!

93
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,320
Naturally...

94
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,350
Those are all the questions I have.

95
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,610
It's futile, Pariston.

96
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,860
Everyone was aware of those answers
when they voted for Leorio.

97
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,930
His supporters applauded because they
have every intention of backing him!

98
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,300
Do you have any questions for me?

99
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,440
No! Let's just get this over with!

100
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,630
I understand.

101
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,630
Then I move for an emergency council.

102
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,140
Huh?

103
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,720
Er, what are you saying?

104
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,640
An emergency council.

105
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,340
In accordance with the Eighth
and Ninth Hunter Commandments,

106
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,400
I move for a vote of confidence.

107
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,110
The topic will be a revision of the Hunter
Commandments and the Hunter Exam.

108
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,160
First, I propose that we abolish the
current Hunter Exam system.

109
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,860
If you agree, please vote "yea."

110
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,730
If you disagree, please vote "nay."

111
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,220
Hold it right there!

112
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,310
During the Zodiac council, we decided

113
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,510
the Ten Commandments weren't to be touched!

114
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,050
That isn't relevant right now!

115
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,300
No.

116
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,050
You're wrong, stupid tiger!

117
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,930
You're absolutely right.

118
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,280
The council reached an 11-1 majority decision.

119
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,930
I was the only one in favor of
revising the Ten Commandments.

120
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,580
If Cheadle-san or Mizaistom-san were
standing on the stage now,

121
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,570
I would have deferred to the council and
kept my mouth shut until the election ended.

122
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,520
But both of them are out of the running.

123
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,080
And Leorio-san has stated that he
has no plan for the Association!

124
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,160
This is the only time

125
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,000
I can express my opinion as vice chairman,
and not as a member of the Zodiacs.

126
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Don't you understand, Kanzai-san?

127
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,970
This is the only chance I will ever get!

128
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,970
Of course, I could use the Eighth Commandment

129
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,570
to override the council's decision
and force the matter to a vote.

130
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,930
But I wanted to avoid that.

131
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,740
The Zodiacs are something precious
that the former chairman left us.

132
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,630
Hey, if you say something stupid,
he'll pay you back ten times over.

133
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,080
Honestly, part of me wishes to let this
matter die without making waves.

134
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,660
However, the late Teradein-san and
Bushidora-san made an excellent point.

135
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,280
The Third and Fourth Commandments

136
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,760
are suffering gravely as a result
of the current exam process!

137
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,990
He doesn't want to win.

138
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,520
He doesn't want to lose, either.

139
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,270
You're right...

140
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,900
He's a spiteful person!

141
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,440
He doesn't care about winning or losing,

142
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,760
so with nothing to gain or lose, he can
always stay dispassionate and calm,

143
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,390
while he manipulates others and plays the rules

144
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,900
against us in the worst way possible.

145
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,920
May I say something?

146
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,330
Yes, what is it?

147
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,810
If Leorio wins, I volunteer to serve as an advisor.

148
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,910
I promise to conduct a comprehensive review of

149
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,940
the Ten Commandments and
Hunter Exam at that point.

150
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,190
I won't let you grab any of the Teradein votes!

151
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,070
I'll counter every point you've made!

152
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,220
To everyone who's voting for
the potential Leorio shows,

153
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,470
but who's concerned about
how he will serve initially,

154
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,400
I will quell those concerns, even if it
requires me to leave the Zodiacs.

155
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,330
Hey, hey, hey!

156
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,010
I have no idea what you people are talking about.

157
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,590
But I'm in a hurry to save Gon
as quickly as possible!

158
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,360
Leorio!

159
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,180
Gon!

160
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,940
Damn!

161
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,950
You had me so worried!

162
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,900
Leorio!

163
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,460
I'm so glad!

164
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,370
So glad!

165
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,110
Did I l look that bad?

166
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,220
Bad doesn't even begin to describe it!

167
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,690
Leorio, stop.

168
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,330
He's healed now. Isn't that enough?

169
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,240
Yeah, you're right.

170
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,870
Everyone was worried about you.

171
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,840
Thank you... Thank you.

172
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,600
He got us.

173
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,180
Pariston wanted Leorio to be his final opponent!

174
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,300
Leorio no longer has the motive or
support to become chairman.

175
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,020
You become chairman!

176
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,030
Leorio, you can't tell Gon that Killua healed him.

177
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,310
Who's the bald guy?

178
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,780
Huh? Why not?

179
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,780
You can't tell him!

180
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,290
For Killua's sake, promise not to tell him.

181
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,930
O-Okay, got it.

182
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,540
Pariston, when?

183
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,620
When did you predict that this would happen?

184
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,890
Huh?

185
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,820
No, no...

186
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,110
I don't have the ability to predict anything.

187
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,370
This was pure coincidence.

188
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,690
Please tell me. I want to know.

189
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,770
It hurts to admit this, but I've been defeated.

190
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,820
It was when Ging-san said he
would run for chairman...

191
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,890
What?

192
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,770
After he said he would run,

193
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,920
I asked a question to provoke him.

194
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,210
And he responded that Gon-kun wouldn't die, right?

195
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,520
Go visit him.

196
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,710
He isn't going to die.

197
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,220
In that moment,

198
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,730
I could see the scene that
just transpired before us.

199
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,610
Well, I anticipated Ging-san
and I would stand on stage,

200
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,700
and Ging-san would ultimately win.

201
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,530
At least, in my vision.

202
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,550
First, since Ging-san said Gon-kun wouldn't die,

203
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,990
I knew that meant there was a way to heal him.

204
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,920
And that if he became part of the
election, I would never win.

205
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,750
Do you understand?

206
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,190
That was the moment I was defeated.

207
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,340
But Ging-san gave up on the election,

208
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,600
then Leorio-san arrived, and hit him.

209
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,100
When he stood on stage

210
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,680
and talked about his friends risking
their lives to save Gon-kun,

211
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,860
I finally saw the complete picture.

212
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,360
I was assured of my victory a moment ago,

213
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,940
when I felt that immense power.

214
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,620
I could sense that Gon-kun's friends had saved him.

215
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,550
All that remained was to delay
the vote until he arrived.

216
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,380
Oh, I'll retract the earlier motion,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

217
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,630
That was all the information you had?

218
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,010
You put your trust in someone
you'd never met before?!

219
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,770
I trust Ging-san as an enemy.

220
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,150
And these are the friends that
Ging-san trusted to save his son.

221
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,400
I trust them.

222
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,330
Why wouldn't I?

223
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,390
Run for chairman!

224
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,550
I'll vote for you!

225
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,180
Get on stage and say something!

226
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,300
Speech! Speech!

227
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,730
Man, I don't know what to do.

228
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,050
Ging?

229
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,080
This is bad.

230
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,000
But, well, this was always gonna happen...

231
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,340
Gon has finally caught sight of Ging's back.

232
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,130
What will he say to him?

233
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,950
Next time: Chairman x And x Release.
