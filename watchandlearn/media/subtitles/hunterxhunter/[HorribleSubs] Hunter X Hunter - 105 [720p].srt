2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,550
Your "remote concealment" strategy

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,460
is actually named "kokoriko."

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,740
I came up with that strategy...

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,990
ten years ago.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,650
I was pretty happy

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,820
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,500
But then, I saw how to defeat it.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,990
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,370
I was so honored and touched...
My heart trembled.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,450
It felt like...

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,690
Like seeing my child brought back to life.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,940
Foolishness.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,740
I've had enough.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,590
Get some rest.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,690
Once we begin again,

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,800
you won't get any more breaks.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,660
Be prepared!

19
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,000
Resolve x And x Awakening

20
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,440
This is upsetting.

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,520
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,340
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,050
But...

24
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,170
At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.

25
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,670
But I don't understand why...

26
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,480
That I do not understand my own mind

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,760
upsets me more than words can describe!

28
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,070
Did she not choose to rest?

29
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,930
No...

30
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,110
Unsightly.

31
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,810
No sign of intelligence or dignity.

32
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,670
How can such a being

33
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,570
boast a Gungi record so stellar
that it could be called

34
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,810
the ultimate in game theory?

35
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,870
Wake up! We're starting again.

36
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,250
Y-Yes...

37
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,300
9-5-1, marshal.

38
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,230
For this match...

39
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,440
Hmm?

40
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,240
We should make a wager.

41
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,380
A wager?

42
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,750
Correct.

43
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,010
If you win, I shall grant
any wish you request.

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,800
Any wish I request?

45
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,600
Any wish...

46
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,510
However...

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,980
If you lose,

48
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,010
I shall take your left arm.

49
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,430
Fear and desire hold the power

50
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,030
to disrupt one's rhythm.

51
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,900
Desire clouds vision,

52
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,180
while fear stills one's step.

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
My left arm...

54
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,070
My left arm...

55
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,630
Should I do it?!

56
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,060
Why do you hesitate?

57
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,700
Well... Instead of my left arm...

58
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,570
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?

59
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,000
What?

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,070
What do you bet?

61
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,070
My life.

62
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,360
If I lose, I will offer you my life.

63
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,080
But you might consider that an insult...

64
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,290
I do not understand.

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,340
Explain yourself.

66
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,060
Um...

67
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,170
Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do.

68
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,600
In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive.

69
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,370
But professional Gungi players,

70
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,420
even national champions, make but a pittance.

71
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,160
Only after you become the world
champion as representative for a nation

72
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,090
will you receive any meaningful reward.

73
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,030
To become the national representative,
you must win tournaments.

74
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,330
In other words, you cannot lose a single match.

75
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,690
I come from a family of twelve,

76
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,100
and in our home, I'm the breadwinner.

77
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,990
If I lose a single match,

78
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,140
I will become the greatest burden on my family.

79
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,430
Gungi players have a saying...

80
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,620
That, after losing once, a Gungi master
becomes a normal person.

81
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,400
If I lose,

82
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,300
I'll be garbage.

83
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,300
Ah, it doesn't bother me!

84
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,960
It's just what my parents always said...

85
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,120
So, the day I set my sights on
becoming a professional player,

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,300
I decided that if I ever lost a match,
I would take my own life.

87
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,400
But that could be a problem...

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,780
How so?

89
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,450
When I lose, I'll become garbage...

90
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,450
And all you'd receive for
winning would be garbage.

91
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,200
That would be a terrible insult.

92
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,460
It doesn't bother me.

93
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,820
I'm more interested in learning
what you'd want if you win.

94
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,820
You see...

95
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,270
I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...

96
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,530
I'll think about it later, after I win.

97
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,090
Very well.

98
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,990
Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?

99
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,940
Your life, was it?

100
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,610
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!

101
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,120
I never imagined that, if you won,
you might ask for my life.

102
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,960
Your Majesty!

103
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,050
Silence!

104
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,860
The Supreme Leader's l-li—

105
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,400
I w-would never ask such a thing!

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,430
The thought never crossed my mind!

107
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,640
I know that.

108
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
The fault is my own.

109
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,630
The wager is off.

110
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
It was a petty tactic.

111
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,650
No...

112
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,150
Accept this apology.

113
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,860
Your Majesty!

114
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,400
How could you do that?

115
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,670
I must treat your arm...

116
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,760
Come with me!

117
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,970
Y-Your arm?

118
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,660
Continue the match.

119
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,790
Huh? Huh?

120
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,950
What happened, Supreme Leader?

121
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,730
It's your turn. Make your move.

122
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,920
Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!

123
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,180
Do not make me repeat myself.

124
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,240
Continue the match.

125
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,190
It was I who said there would be no more breaks.

126
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,260
Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?

127
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,880
I shall summon Neferpitou.

128
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,750
I am sure that you can continue to play,

129
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,250
as your arm is reattached.

130
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,700
That is the best compromise I can offer.

131
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,210
If you refuse to accept it,

132
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,460
you may take my head now!

133
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,410
Very well.

134
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,640
Come closer.

135
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,220
I shall end it with a single strike.

136
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,610
It's your turn.

137
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,920
Make your move.

138
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,910
I refuse.

139
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,560
I refuse to move before you
have your injury treated.

140
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,590
Don't make me repeat myself.
Make your move.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,190
I refuse.

142
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,500
If you wish to kill me,

143
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,950
use Gungi!

144
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,370
Why, you...

145
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
Summon Pitou!

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
At once!

147
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,390
There's no doubt.

148
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,460
All the puppets have vanished.

149
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,620
Have they resumed the selection process?

150
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,800
No, I doubt it.

151
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,630
We have the capital surrounded.

152
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,650
The King's safety is their top priority.
They wouldn't leave him.

153
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,750
Then what's going on?

154
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,050
My assumption would be that
some threat greater than us

155
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,530
has befallen the Royal Guard,
or upon the King himself.

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
So this is it?

157
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,290
Our golden opportunity?

158
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,310
Yes...

159
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,740
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.

160
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,760
However, it may be a trap.

161
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,270
That shouldn't be the case...

162
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,980
They wouldn't use any tactic that
might endanger the King.

163
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,240
They would if the King ordered it.

164
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,190
I suppose...

165
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:16,110
Regardless, they've retracted
their long-range radar.

166
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,700
We should use this chance to
get as close as possible.

167
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,660
I must create a portal near the palace,

168
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,010
or the plan will fail.

169
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,250
This dangerous job had to be done eventually.

170
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,910
And the time is now.

171
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,740
There!

172
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
I found them.

173
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,750
It appears Cheetu failed.

174
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,090
Try not to die.

175
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,040
Same to you.

176
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,550
They've split up for us.

177
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,210
I found them.

178
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,050
We'll switch to the man with the pipe!

179
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,950
Let's go!

180
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,540
Doctor Blythe.

181
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,330
Toy Repair
Doctor Blythe

182
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,590
7-9-1, spy.

183
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,090
2-3-1, pawn.

184
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,290
How long will the operation take?

185
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,600
I'd say two or three hours
until complete recovery.

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,710
And during that time, you cannot use
either your puppets or En, correct?

187
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,610
This ability requires a lot of Nen.

188
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,770
A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.

189
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,620
While you treat His Majesty,
I shall watch the surroundings.

190
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,040
Though my En is nowhere as effective as yours.

191
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,230
Regardless, this is an important task
that I cannot trust to anyone else.

192
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,720
As expected, I cannot sense any En use...

193
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,690
The rain helps to lower visibility.

194
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,240
Soon, the sun will set.

195
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,480
Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness.

196
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,660
And picking out enemy aura will be easier.

197
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,410
Be patient.

198
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,660
The closer the portal is to
the palace, the better.

199
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,470
But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless.

200
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,630
While I can enter and exit freely,

201
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,140
Shoot and the rest can only use
the portal to leave once they enter.

202
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,180
If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit,

203
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,100
it will mean serious trouble.

204
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,920
I must prepare three exits in the area
around the palace, one near, one far,

205
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,870
and one somewhere in between, then
place entrances even further away.

206
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,130
I'll set up the entrances in groups of three,
in locations where the palace is within sight.

207
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,380
When the mission starts, we can enter
by the most convenient location.

208
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,250
Once it's time to act,

209
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,360
the situation will determine
whether we approach

210
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,990
by the near exit, the far exit,
or the one in between.

211
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,970
Once that has been determined, we act.

212
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,190
From the enemy's perspective,
we will be appearing from nowhere.

213
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,430
We must use that opening to separate
the King and Royal Guard.

214
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,290
That is when our battles will begin!

215
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,830
It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record,

216
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,240
so long as the King is their one loss.

217
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,060
Under normal circumstances,

218
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,380
I would already be within
range of Neferpitou's En.

219
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,860
This is quite tense...

220
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,360
However, I am still far away.

221
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,310
The farthest exit

222
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,910
must be on the palace grounds,
or it won't be any use to us!

223
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,500
Advance carefully, but swiftly!

224
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,320
Should I wait for the sun to set?

225
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,630
But, will this scenario hold out until then?

226
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,620
I have no choice...

227
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,850
Should Neferpitou's En return,

228
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,770
approaching the palace will be impossible.

229
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,440
If I fail, we still have other options!

230
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,480
I have nothing to fear.

231
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,170
Advance...

232
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,050
Advance...

233
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,320
In the palace,

234
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,950
there are three humans not intended as food.

235
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,460
The first is the Gungi player.

236
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,330
The second is Diego.

237
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,430
And the third...

238
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,390
is Secretary Bizeff.

239
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,200
Behind the scenes, he was
the country's true ruler.

240
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,990
All dealings with foreign parties
and domestic organizations

241
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,440
went through him as an intermediary.

242
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,750
Since he cannot be replaced,

243
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,110
he is the only human allowed near the King.

244
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,350
No human guards are posted near the palace.

245
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,460
Because ordinary soldiers would
be powerless against Nen users,

246
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,480
the Royal Guard determined that the
presence of ordinary soldiers would,

247
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,550
in fact, increase the risk of infiltration.

248
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,900
The only Squadron Leader present
is Cheetu, who has just returned.

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,960
There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.

250
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,010
In other words,

251
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,790
there are currently only three humans
and eleven Ants in the palace.

252
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,750
The Soldier Ants are

253
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,410
the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.

254
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,050
Thus, they are not involved
in the King's protection.

255
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,630
Essentially, the Squadron Leaders

256
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,140
no longer have any strict fealty to the King.

257
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,140
They work together simply
because their goals align.

258
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,000
Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard

259
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,250
have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks
that are expected to end in failure.

260
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,160
Hence, they would not be trusted
with monitoring the palace.

261
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,880
However, Knov does not know this.

262
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,890
As he attempts to infiltrate the palace,

263
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,030
he has no idea that this is
his best, and last, chance.

264
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,680
I managed to survive somehow...

265
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,220
But on my own, I can only work so much.

266
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,690
I must convince them

267
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,050
to at least provide three more
staffers to do secretarial duties...

268
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,990
Otherwise, I'll die of overwork.

269
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,960
Sending list of available bodies.

270
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,340
"Thinker...

271
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,750
Bell."

272
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,760
Per our arrangement,
I request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119.

273
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,280
This is it.

274
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,780
He took the bait, Palm-kun!

275
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,540
While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,

276
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,710
Palm is preparing to launch
her own infiltration plan.

277
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,640
Next time: Knov x And x Morel.

278
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,050
Today, this person is joining me!

279
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,310
Why am I here?

280
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,650
Because Killua isn't around!

281
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,260
Scream.
