2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,350
I'll tear your body apart.

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Last x Test Of x Resolve

11
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,360
During the exam's Third Phase,

12
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,180
which requires applicants to
reach Trick Tower's base

13
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,410
within seventy-two hours,

14
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,740
Gon and his friends have incurred
a penalty of fifty hours.

15
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,920
Meanwhile...

16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,540
Gerreta, applicant #384,
is the fourth to pass.

17
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,430
Total time, twelve hours
and twenty-seven minutes.

18
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,340
Eh...

19
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,690
Not bad, I guess.

20
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,230
If you hesitate on the first step,
you'll hurt yourself.

21
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,330
Got it.

22
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,300
Hey, Kurapika.

23
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,040
Once we've spent fifty hours here,

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,580
we'll have fewer than ten hours, right?

25
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes, that's correct.

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,170
That's way more than enough time!

27
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,410
You're a fool.

28
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,220
What's that?

29
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,470
Phase Three lasts seventy-two hours.

30
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,280
And each phase is designed to weed out

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,340
half of the remaining candidates.

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,980
So, on average, it's meant to
take seventy-two hours.

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,590
Just more proof that you're an idiot.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,580
Well, our chances of reaching
the goal within ten hours

35
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,740
will depend on the remaining trials.

36
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,170
Yeah, that's true.

37
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
But when we've got a guy
who's so down on his luck,

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,050
he can't even win a simple game
of rock-paper-scissors...

39
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,000
What was that?!

40
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,380
You deliberately lost a bet,
just to satiate your libido.

41
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,090
Then you chose rock-paper-scissors,
a contest you couldn't win.

42
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,550
Shut up!

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,590
You surrendered without even a fight!

44
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,140
I...

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,270
I give!

46
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,960
Sure, I surrendered.

47
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,900
But I only wasted a second of our time.

48
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,270
You lost,

49
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,820
squandering fifty of our remaining hours.

50
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,780
Take some responsibility, huh?

51
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,500
Besides, what kind of Hunter

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,910
is so bad at gambling?

53
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,080
Shut up!

54
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,620
You don't even want to become a Hunter...

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,540
You only care about ruining our chances.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,300
And now, you'll have
the guilt eating at you

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
for the rest of this exam phase.

58
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey! What are you doing?

59
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,650
Sorry about that.

60
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,780
Don't skateboard inside this tiny room!

61
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,440
Aww...

62
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,610
Can't sleep?

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,410
That's not it.

64
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,740
I can go two or three days

65
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,980
without sleep.

66
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,270
Ten hours have passed, huh...

67
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,990
There aren't any windows,
so it's hard to tell.

68
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,960
But it's probably morning.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,530
Most likely.

70
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,670
Hey, pipe down.

71
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,730
Let me sleep some more...

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,650
That stinks!

73
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,000
What's wrong with you guys?

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,660
That wasn't funny.

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,710
Bastard, you'd better not
be pretending to sleep.

76
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,230
Damn, now I'm totally awake...

77
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,000
And we still have forty hours left?

78
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,420
Oh, I thought you just had

79
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,910
to stick bait on a hook,
and you could fish.

80
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,780
Yeah.

81
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,970
You have to think like a fish.

82
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,610
Think like a fish?

83
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,590
Yep!

84
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,010
How would a fish feel if it saw
bait dangling in front of it?

85
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,050
Give me that.

86
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,690
Wow!

87
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,050
Let me try.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,180
Like this?

89
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,370
You missed.

90
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,730
Just watch.

91
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,770
H-Hey...

92
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,010
What are you doing?

93
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,150
Hey...

94
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,460
Just as planned!

95
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,150
Nice.

96
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,140
Hey, you'll tear my pants.

97
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,130
Stop it...

98
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,510
See? I caught him.

99
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,280
Yep.

100
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,290
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm a fish now?!

102
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,530
You don't have to get so mad.

103
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,370
It's not like I'm gonna grill and eat you.

104
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,790
Don't mess with me, fool!

105
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,290
Man, I can't even take a nap.

106
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,370
What are you smiling about?

107
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,880
Nothing, really.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,130
You must be up to something again.

109
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,680
Of course not.

110
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,850
I just want to spend

111
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,020
the rest of my time here peacefully.

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,270
Liar!

113
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,820
I don't trust you, got it?

114
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,700
The feeling's mutual.

115
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,140
Yes, the goal!

116
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,470
Pokkle, applicant #53.

117
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,240
Goz, applicant #371.

118
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,350
Both arrived simultaneously.

119
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,480
Total time, thirty hours
and four minutes.

120
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,450
Damn.

121
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,580
Old timer...

122
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,080
In a tie, the applicant with
the lower number wins.

123
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,110
These guys must be very skilled.

124
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,120
I would love to fight them eventually.

125
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,690
You lost,

126
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,220
squandering fifty of our remaining hours.

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,070
Take some responsibility, huh?

128
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,530
Ow!

129
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
One more hour...

130
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,060
Sommy, applicant #118,
is the thirteenth to pass.

131
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,560
Total time, sixty-one hours
and fifty-four minutes.

132
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,220
Man, still ten hours left?

133
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,200
I finished too early.

134
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,080
Okay...

135
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,700
Ready to go!

136
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,950
One more minute.

137
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,700
This is one long minute.

138
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,990
Ah...

139
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,310
Wait up, Gon!

140
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:41,190
Hunter Vocabulary

141
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,190
Bored

142
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,170
Thirty minutes of running,
just to end up where we started.

143
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,960
We should have taken those stairs down.

144
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,140
Shut up!

145
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,470
We all agreed on this route!

146
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,590
Man, I'm covered in dust.

147
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,520
H-Hurry up.

148
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,360
We only have an hour left...

149
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,870
We're supposed to vote on
whether to open the door?

150
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,940
We need to move on. So obviously,
we want to open the door.

151
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,830
I've had enough of your crap.

152
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,380
Wait, I pressed O.

153
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,800
Don't lie...

154
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,010
You specialize in ruining
other people's chances!

155
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,710
Sorry, Leorio.

156
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,650
Eh?

157
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,950
I accidentally pressed the wrong button.

158
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,020
What?

159
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
Oh, I see.

160
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Wait.

161
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,980
Huh?

162
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,550
You owe me an apology.

163
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,880
I can't let that slide.

164
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,990
It's your own fault,

165
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,530
for doing things to make me distrust you.

166
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,310
I don't owe you anything.

167
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,070
You make it sound like I'm to blame

168
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,290
for everything that's gone wrong.

169
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,790
What?

170
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,920
Have you forgotten

171
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,840
who cost us those fifty hours?

172
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,800
You're the one who made
a critical mistake.

173
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,940
Hey, Leorio...

174
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,220
Shut up, Kurapika!

175
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,040
Stop this, guys.

176
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,770
It's my fault for pressing
the wrong button.

177
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,370
Stupid.

178
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,860
I'm moving on.

179
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,730
Wait, Killua!

180
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,690
Hey, Gon...

181
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,610
We're getting close to the goal.

182
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,870
What? Really?

183
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,460
Let's see...

184
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,010
"This will be the last decision
made by majority rule.

185
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,000
Are you ready?

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,390
Choose O or X."

187
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,380
That's it.

188
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,850
Am I ready?

189
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,380
You bet.

190
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,930
Bastard...

191
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,830
Stop!

192
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,390
We don't have time to argue about this!

193
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,780
Please select a path.

194
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,020
There are two choices.

195
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,110
One path allows five to pass,

196
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,940
but is long and difficult.

197
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,770
The other path allows only three,

198
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,730
but is short and easy.

199
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,930
Incidentally, the long and difficult path

200
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,910
requires a minimum of forty-five hours.

201
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,180
The short and easy path leads

202
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,230
to the goal in approximately three minutes.

203
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,550
Press O for the long and difficult path,

204
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,800
and X for the short and easy path.

205
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,150
If X is selected,

206
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,940
two people must be secured to
the wall with handcuffs,

207
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,530
before the door will open.

208
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,620
The two chained members

209
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,440
will be unable to move until
the time limit expires.

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,940
The examiners were very prepared.

211
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,810
I think they have

212
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,700
every weapon under the sun here.

213
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,100
Two out of five...

214
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,830
So we're supposed to fight,
to decide the three who pass?

215
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,150
Let me make this clear.

216
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,710
I'm going to press X.

217
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,340
But I have no intention of staying behind.

218
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,340
I'll do whatever it takes to
be one of the three...

219
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,350
You're shameless.

220
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,670
Had you not wasted fifty hours,

221
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,720
we could have taken the long path.

222
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,480
Shouldn't you take responsibility
and stay behind?

223
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,770
What?!

224
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,170
I'm sure everyone else agrees!

225
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,830
Have I said anything inaccurate?

226
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,360
Hold on.

227
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm going to press O.

228
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,860
We made it all the way here together.

229
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,160
I want us all to pass together.

230
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,840
Gon...

231
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,100
Even if it's a big risk,

232
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,920
I want to give it a shot!

233
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,660
Come on...

234
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,800
You can't really call this a risk.

235
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,670
We have less than an hour.

236
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,480
Gon, there's only one choice

237
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,510
if you want to pass this exam.

238
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,680
There you have it.

239
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,110
Now we have to decide how to
choose which three pass.

240
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,140
Well, I'm planning on

241
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,440
two of them being you and me.

242
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,950
Heh, I've made it this far.

243
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,860
I won't fail now.

244
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,990
Whoever makes the first move wins.

245
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,460
Must we really fight amongst ourselves?

246
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,840
Tonpa, that was dirty!

247
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,510
In a fight,

248
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,800
there's no such thing as dirty!

249
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,060
Bastard!

250
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,140
Stop this, you two!

251
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,310
Come on... Let's do it together.

252
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,520
Before we start fighting,

253
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,190
we have to choose O or X!

254
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,220
It's too late for that!

255
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,990
Time to put you in your place!

256
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,370
Right back at you.

257
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,030
Seems our only choice is to fight.

258
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,380
What should I do?

259
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,880
Three minutes remain.

260
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,250
It's finally over...

261
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,970
Yeah, that took forever.

262
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,870
Made it in time...

263
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,910
He's dead.

264
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,860
The fool.

265
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,690
Better to live and try again,

266
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,190
than to pass and die.

267
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,290
One minute remains.

268
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,220
Looks like it'll just be
the nineteen here.

269
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,650
Kurapika, applicant #404,
is the twentieth to pass.

270
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,410
Killua, applicant #99,
is the twenty-first to pass.

271
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
Gon, applicant #405,
is the twenty-second to pass.

272
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,170
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.

273
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,650
My butt hurts...

274
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,830
I didn't expect a slide

275
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,590
for the short and easy path.

276
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,940
Three of them...

277
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,350
Thirty seconds remain.

278
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,220
That was really close.

279
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,320
My hands are covered with blisters.

280
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,730
Same here.

281
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,700
Leorio, applicant #403,
is the twenty-third to pass.

282
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,490
Tonpa, applicant #16,
is the twenty-fourth to pass.

283
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,240
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.

284
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,350
My hands are blistered,

285
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,120
but all five of us cleared
the tower together.

286
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,310
All thanks to Gon!

287
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,290
We entered the long and difficult path.

288
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,210
Then cut a hole in the wall,

289
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,030
to sneak into the short and easy path.

290
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,600
Man, I can't believe

291
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,830
you actually came up with
that idea on the spot.

292
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,160
I realized that we could break
the walls, using the weapons.

293
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,160
But it took over fifty minutes.

294
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,840
In an extreme situation,

295
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,670
you were able to calmly evaluate

296
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,920
our two options and circumvent them.

297
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,420
That's what makes you special.

298
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,450
The Third Phase of the exam is over.

299
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,140
Twenty-five applicants have passed.

300
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,390
One has died.

301
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,580
Though the team members
had their differences,

302
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,940
Gon was able to bring them together,
to overcome the trial.

303
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,450
However, a friend today may
become a foe tomorrow.

304
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,900
Gon doesn't know that before long,

305
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,990
they'll be pitted

306
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,370
against each other,
in brutal, individual battles.

307
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,460
Next time: Letter x From x Gon!

308
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,850
Now I'm worried.

309
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,890
Because of me?
