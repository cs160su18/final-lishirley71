00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,630
Sorry about that.

10
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,720
I carelessly let him escape.

11
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,570
Liar.

12
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,440
He probably begged you to grant him

13
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,950
one final wish, yes?

14
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,080
Well, I felt sorry for the guy.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,020
Given that he was dead either way.

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,260
You should cease pitying enemies
who serve no purpose.

17
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,630
I have standards.

18
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,710
I'm not interested in people
who have no purpose.

19
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,090
I only spare those whose deaths
would go to waste.

20
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,100
Defeat x And x Disgrace

21
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,290
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,320
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.

23
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,320
In the silence of the night,
something is surely about to happen...

24
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,600
Now!

25
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,220
Oh, it's them...

26
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,490
Amusing.

27
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,050
Hisoka has found his prey.

28
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,390
Leorio! Kurapika!

29
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,240
I didn't expect him to go
after Leorio and Kurapika.

30
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,150
What should I do?

31
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
Don't stop!

32
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,140
Stick to the plan,

33
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,030
and when Hisoka attacks his prey,

34
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,240
go for the ID tag!

35
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,740
That's my only chance to take Hisoka's tag!

36
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,550
No, I can't just ignore them.

37
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,800
If they start fighting, I'll change plans.

38
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,310
So I've figured out who my target is,

39
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,800
but how am I supposed to find her
on this huge island?

40
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,650
Isn't walking around aimlessly
a waste of energy?

41
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,570
Constantly whining would be
an even bigger waste of energy.

42
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,230
You already have six points,
so you're finished.

43
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,700
But if I don't find my target...

44
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,340
Hey.

45
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,130
Hisoka!

46
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,370
Imagine meeting you here...

47
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,300
I keep running into people
I don't want to encounter.

48
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,790
You see,

49
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,390
I need two more points.

50
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,080
Could you give me your tags?

51
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,770
What was that?!

52
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,280
Screw that! I'm not gonna...

53
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,070
Leorio!

54
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,500
You said that you need
two additional points.

55
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,520
Which implies that we
are not your targets,

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,910
correct?

57
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm the one who's asking
the questions here.

58
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,910
Will you give me your tags or not?

59
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,670
That depends.

60
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,570
We currently have four tags.

61
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,910
Mine, my target's, Leorio's,

62
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,930
and a tag worth only a single point to us.

63
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,410
Of these,

64
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,680
only two could be the number of your target.

65
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,940
Mine, or the tag only worth a single point.

66
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,420
Leorio's number is #403.

67
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,820
He was the target of #16, Tonpa.

68
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,320
And my target was #16.

69
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,560
Each person was assigned
a different target,

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,580
so #16 and #403 are out.

71
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,830
Indeed...

72
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,590
Neither of those is my target.

73
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,840
So?

74
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,840
That leaves the other two tags.

75
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,580
If you're willing to take the tag worth
only one point to us and leave,

76
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,650
you can have it.

77
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,350
Huh?

78
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,350
But I will not let you have mine.

79
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,270
And the same goes for the other two.

80
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,060
If you insist on taking them by force,

81
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,110
you'll have to fight me!

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Out of curiosity, what is your number?

83
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,540
#404.

84
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,780
Very well.

85
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,480
You have a deal.

86
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,050
I'll only take the one tag.

87
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll leave it here.

88
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,890
Don't worry.

89
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,320
I'll be standing here for a while.

90
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,850
In only a few days,

91
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,570
they've grown so much,
I barely recognize them.

92
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,840
But they have much more to learn...

93
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,940
Why must unripe fruit

94
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,260
be so tantalizing?

95
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,020
A pity.

96
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,100
This is the wrong tag...

97
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,540
Whew...

98
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,610
But now I only have one more chance.

99
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,520
When Hisoka locates his next prey.

100
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,710
Wait!

101
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,630
What if the next person Hisoka finds

102
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,640
doesn't fight him either?

103
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,550
That's right!

104
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,090
If that person also hands over a tag,

105
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,780
I won't get another chance!

106
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm so stupid!

107
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,170
I never even considered that!

108
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm scared...

109
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,700
No more.

110
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I don't want to be here!

111
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,450
I can sense his blood lust from here...

112
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,880
Uh-oh.

113
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,000
Those boys got me all tingly...

114
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,370
I must calm it.

115
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,020
Okay.

116
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,030
Time to go.

117
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,180
I can do this!

118
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,280
His blood lust has calmed,

119
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,780
but the look in his eyes
doesn't even compare to before.

120
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,380
I'm certain he'll attack

121
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,290
the next person he sees,
even if that person surrenders.

122
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,410
I know!

123
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,810
I should move ahead and
locate his next prey!

124
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,210
I also need to find a good spot
from which to steal his tag...

125
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,760
There!

126
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,830
At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.

127
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,200
I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...

128
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,950
Over there!

129
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,590
I've gotta hurry.

130
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,590
Hisoka will attack,

131
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,340
as soon as he notices that guy.

132
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,880
This is my chance to steal his tag...

133
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,770
My last chance!

134
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:37,170
Hunter Vocabulary

135
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,170
Chance

136
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,390
Hisoka has completely
hidden his presence.

137
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,850
Oh, no! He's going to notice me!

138
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,780
I have to conceal my presence, too.

139
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,250
Completely conceal my...

140
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,890
presence.

141
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,140
Here he comes!

142
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,140
Hisoka!

143
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,400
Damn... Bring it!

144
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,400
He's going to fight back.

145
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,460
I did it...

146
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,390
I took Hisoka's tag!

147
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,420
Approximately, seven thousand.

148
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,920
Do you know what that
number represents?

149
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,430
The number of chances
I had to kill you.

150
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,800
It's also the number of times you swung

151
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,440
your fishing rod when you were training.

152
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,580
You were completely open
when you were swinging your rod.

153
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,280
But I admit that I admired your
concentration and accuracy.

154
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,550
That swing just now was
especially impressive.

155
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,260
But you didn't pay attention to
your own surroundings.

156
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,080
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.

157
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,110
So long.

158
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,500
Damn it...

159
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,650
You surprise me.

160
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,280
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?

161
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,660
Waiting for me to attack another?

162
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,840
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?

163
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,460
Marvelous...

164
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,920
Like a wild animal.

165
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,550
And your timing was impeccable.

166
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,930
You concealed all traces of your attack

167
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,930
by timing it with my own attack.

168
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,080
A splendid job.

169
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,540
His poison darts completely
relax your muscles.

170
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,690
The effects last ten days
in a normal person.

171
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,900
Only three days are left.

172
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,940
I'm sure you will have
recovered by then.

173
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,020
Wait...

174
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:49,710
Didn't you come to take back your tag?

175
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,770
No, I just came to commend you.

176
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,460
Turns out that he was my target.

177
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,250
So I don't need that anymore.

178
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,610
I don't need it, either.

179
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,470
Don't say that...

180
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,510
You owe me one now.

181
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,120
Feel free to pay me back when you want.

182
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,430
Goodbye.

183
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,810
I don't want to owe anyone...

184
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,740
You can have it back now.

185
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,870
I refuse.

186
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,870
Right now, I'm letting you live.

187
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,380
And I'll continue to keep you alive,

188
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,380
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

189
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll only take it back

190
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,150
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

191
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,270
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

192
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,720
Gon was completely helpless
against Hisoka,

193
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,150
who knocked him out
with a single blow.

194
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,730
What must he be thinking,
alone in the darkness?

195
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,010
Next time: Trap x In The x Hole!

196
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,920
The end... the end...

197
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,050
I wanna be your friend!

198
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,010
F-Friend?

199
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,390
Y-You're so embarrassing...
