2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,750
You're really sure? You won't tell them?

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,480
Yes.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,990
Right now, they should be
spending every second training.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,250
Tell them we'll meet again.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,490
Sure.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,970
So long.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,020
Goodbye.

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,990
Oh, one second...

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,250
Look after Kurapika.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,690
He acts calm, but he can be rash.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,000
He's smart, but doesn't
always think things through.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,890
It looks like he's opened up to you,

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,880
so could you act as a brake?

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,510
Yes.

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,260
You're very soothing.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,020
You have the most pleasant
heartbeat I've heard in this city.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,670
It's soft, expansive, and very warm.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,900
You would make an excellent
doctor or teacher.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,810
You're well suited to such careers.

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,030
I recommend a career change.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,680
Well, I'll think about it.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,190
I need to get serious about this...

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,050
End x And x Beginning

25
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,640
#16 has won Greed Island for 27.8 billion!

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,650
Thank you very much!

27
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,540
That bastard's serious
about buying every copy.

28
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,330
And he's aware of my budget.

29
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,570
Only one copy left.

30
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,720
Damn...

31
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm going to win this auction!

32
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,080
What? He left?

33
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,680
We'll see him again.

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,580
He said to keep training hard.

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,080
What? He didn't have to worry about that...

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,840
Weren't you happy that Kurapika
was leaving Yorknew City?

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,670
Sure, but he left without telling us.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,930
Here.

39
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,350
It's from Zepile.

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,160
He said that you'll see him again.

41
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,560
What?

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,960
Zepile-san's gone, too?

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,850
Yeah, and he recovered your
hundred million, as promised.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,390
He really did...

45
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,000
Now you can buy back
your Hunter License.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah...

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,390
Zepile-san really is special.

48
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,700
Man, that Hunter License is a real gem.

49
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,590
The pawn shop forked over a
hundred million on the spot.

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,960
In a proper auction, you could
probably add two zeros...

51
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,620
I know!

52
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,890
I should become a pro Hunter
so I can sell the license...

53
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,010
I could live off the interest alone.
And forget about debt!

54
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,240
Okay, then let's get crackin'!

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,250
And start prepping for the Hunter Exam!

56
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,150
#16 wins Greed Island for 60.2 billion.

57
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,300
Thank you very much.

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,160
60.2 billion..

59
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,740
That's insane.

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,170
And he won all seven copies.

61
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,510
But it cost him half of his wealth.

62
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,920
Recently, an unknown party
stole a copy of Greed Island

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,230
won at auction for 30.5 billion by Mr. Battera.

64
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,790
But, not to be discouraged, yesterday he
won another copy for 27.8 billion,

65
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,690
and another today for 60.2 billion.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,940
He must have some reason
to go so far for this game.

67
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,690
I've heard that upon clearing the game,
you receive a treasure map.

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,950
Or a giant dragon appears
to grant your wish.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,950
All kinds of rumors are flying around.

70
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,800
Thank you!

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm going home.

72
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,460
Mr. Battera was able to acquire
all the copies of Greed Island.

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,030
He's also seeking players,
but today's the deadline!

74
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,220
There's already an amazing
line outside the venue.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,630
I apologize for keeping everyone waiting.

76
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,230
We will now begin selecting the players.

77
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,600
As everyone already knows,

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,180
you must be able to use Nen for this game.

79
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,470
The test will proceed as follows.

80
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,710
First, we need each applicant
to demonstrate their Nen.

81
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,120
We will then make our decision.

82
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,880
The judge will be the
pro Hunter, Mr. Tsezgerra!

83
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,010
The Money Hunter Tsezgerra!

84
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,910
If he's involved...

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,720
This game must pay big dividends.

86
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,140
Let us begin the test.

87
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,640
One at a time, come up
and show me your Ren.

88
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,900
A shutter and curtain will block
any view of the stage,

89
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
so other applicants cannot
see what's happening.

90
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,190
The moment we've chosen thirty-two
players, the test will end.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,410
Please step this way to take the test.

92
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,920
That's our only explanation?

93
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,940
Would the first applicant
please step in.

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,240
They only gave us a minimal explanation
and left everything unknown.

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,660
But the others are already moving
like it's the natural response.

96
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,490
They must know.

97
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,360
Those guys aren't going to answer any questions.

98
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,800
Our task is simple.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,330
Deduce all we can from the information
provided, and then do our best.

100
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,530
I'm certain they're judging
us on the entire process.

101
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,830
Approximately two hundred are in the hall.

102
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,000
About a hundred have already lined up.

103
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,970
At least fifty are watching from the sidelines.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,470
And twenty haven't moved an inch.

105
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,610
Which group chose correctly?

106
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,230
Next, please.

107
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,600
Next.

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Something's wrong...

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,500
Ten people have gone in,

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,740
but no one's come out!

111
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,130
Does that mean they all passed?

112
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,630
This is bad.

113
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,020
Should we get in line?

114
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,500
Those guys are hopeless...

115
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
They don't stand a chance.

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,500
Huh?

117
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,040
I'm talking about the ones still in

118
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,630
line and those waiting nearby.

119
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,390
Especially the ones
standing next to the line.

120
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,060
They're probably waiting
for someone to return,

121
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,140
so they can ask what's inside.

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,050
If you did some research
and used your head,

123
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,330
you'd see there's no rush.

124
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,390
In other words, you can't
send in new players.

125
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,240
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.

126
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,490
I get it!

127
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,460
This time, they aren't
choosing thirty-two players!

128
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,000
Exactly.

129
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,120
It's been over ten years,
and no one's cleared the game.

130
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,480
And new players can't begin
if old ones are still alive.

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Meaning that they have
to save a few spots

132
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,020
in case any extraordinary
players appear.

133
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,270
I'd guess they'll choose
around twenty this round...

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,340
Personally, I'd say that those in line

135
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,600
or standing nearby have no shot.

136
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,270
Anyone worthwhile either
got in line at once,

137
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,540
or figured out the trick and stayed in
their seats to focus, like we did.

138
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,910
Wouldn't you agree, kid?

139
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,200
Gon?

140
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,830
You realized what was going on?

141
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,050
Well, it was just a hunch.

142
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:45,300
I thought it was only natural that the hosts
would want to test everyone here.

143
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,120
That's true.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,060
You win, kid.

145
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
Yeah, I'm impressed.

146
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,070
Not many people can stick to their ideals.

147
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,820
The steeper and more dangerous the path,

148
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,330
the greater the need for both wit
and ignorance to move forward.

149
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,580
Next, please.

150
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,790
My name is Puhat.

151
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,400
Nice to meet you.

152
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,330
People who act smart usually fail.

153
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,090
He can hear you.

154
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,520
But he's right.

155
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,100
I was too focused on logically
deducing the best method.

156
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm heading over.

157
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,730
Yep, good luck.

158
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,170
If I want to advance,
I'll have to take risks.

159
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,860
Because I've chosen a dangerous path!

160
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,870
Listen to me... Never take risks.

161
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,260
Act only when success is guaranteed.

162
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,310
Otherwise, wait.

163
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,810
Waiting is our most crucial job.

164
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,590
If victory isn't assured, revealing your
strength is the most foolish move to make.

165
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,260
That's how my old man operates.

166
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,010
But I'm no longer an assassin.

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,830
I'm a Hunter!

168
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,440
Let me see your Ren.

169
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,270
Can I show you my Hatsu instead?

170
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,100
That's fine.

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,280
You're free to show me anything
that demonstrates your power.

172
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,400
Prove that the Ren I saw previously

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,030
didn't represent your true power.

174
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,800
Then, I'll get started.

175
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,550
He changed his aura into electricity!

176
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,620
In theory, it's certainly possible...

177
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,340
But it's unbelievable

178
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,560
that he learned this from
scratch in four days!

179
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,930
Well? Need to see more?

180
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,120
No, that's enough.

181
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,310
You pass.

182
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,810
Yes!

183
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,650
However, this technique could not

184
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,450
have fully developed overnight.

185
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,590
You'd require years of
torturous training,

186
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,300
exposing your body to strong electricity.

187
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,810
Who are you?

188
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,030
Strong electricity?

189
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,390
From birth, I've been
exposed to electricity.

190
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,800
Family reasons.

191
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,040
Seven people...

192
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,320
That guy was right.

193
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,830
The people who passed are those
who moved immediately

194
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,380
or waited in their seats.

195
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,030
Well, I wonder if Gon will be okay.

196
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,180
Gon.

197
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,640
Killua!

198
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,980
Good, you got chosen.

199
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,140
Of course.

200
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,310
Was that boom your doing?

201
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,170
Uh-huh.

202
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,670
Honestly...

203
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,990
Those kids are scary.

204
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,280
Well, allow me to congratulate you.

205
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,820
The twenty-one people
here have earned the

206
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,680
right to play Greed Island.

207
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,690
Upon clearing the game,
you will receive 50 billion Jenny.

208
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,670
The details are in the contract,

209
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,820
so read and sign it before
you depart at 5 PM.

210
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,330
Cheers!

211
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,540
You've made it past the first stage.

212
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,400
Could you look at this for us?

213
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,700
What is it?

214
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,330
A contract?

215
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,610
Looks like it can be summarized in three points.

216
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,480
First, you can't file any claims
if you're injured or die.

217
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Second, any items that you bring out

218
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,590
of the game belong to Mr. Battera.

219
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,800
Third, if you clear the game,

220
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
you will receive a
50-billion Jenny reward.

221
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,740
I don't see any problems.

222
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,420
Yep!

223
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,370
So once you sign it, you're good to go.

224
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,100
That second point seems important.

225
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,290
"Anything that you
bring out of the game."

226
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,990
That's why he's paying the big bucks.

227
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,570
Anything? Like what?

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,490
I'm willing to hand it over.

229
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,930
I'm not looking for items.

230
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,000
I just want to get closer to Ging!

231
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,710
See ya.

232
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,410
Good luck on your exam, Leorio.

233
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,930
Yeah, you guys be careful.

234
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,010
Next time we see you,
you'll be a doctor.

235
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,270
Wouldn't that mean we won't see

236
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,910
each other for at least four years?

237
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,520
We plan to clear the
game much more quickly.

238
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,770
I don't intend to fall behind.

239
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,230
Now, then...

240
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,400
Before we begin, let me
explain a few things.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,620
The individual game copies
are not independent.

242
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,480
It doesn't matter which
console you start from.

243
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,450
You will all arrive at the same place.

244
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,470
Consider it a virtual area accessible
from any spot on this planet.

245
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,630
Fizz...

246
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,410
I will now hand out memory cards.

247
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,750
You will head immediately into the game.

248
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,150
But first, we must decide the order.

249
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,140
Order?

250
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,590
Only one may enter the game area at a time.

251
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,300
We will decide the order now,

252
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,400
to forestall bickering inside the game.

253
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,650
Then let's use rock-paper-scissors.

254
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,150
Yes! I'm first!

255
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,150
Oh?

256
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,910
You're the boy who had a save file.

257
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,910
Damn, I'm 17th!

258
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,170
Do you want to use it?

259
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,170
Don't worry.

260
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,320
Your initial destination is

261
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,370
always the same, regardless of your save.

262
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,180
Ging...

263
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,510
This game is a message from Ging to me.

264
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,180
I'm going to trust him!

265
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,190
I'll use my own card.

266
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,690
Then put the ring on,
and start the game.

267
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,440
Gon.

268
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,470
Wait in the starting
area until I get there.

269
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,590
Once you see a "Now Playing" message,

270
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,460
the next person can begin.

271
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,010
Welcome to Greed Island.

272
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,530
You must be Mr. Gon Freecss.

273
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,380
I will now explain how the game works.

274
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,030
Would you care to listen?

275
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,900
Sure.

276
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,510
In this game, two magic spells are

277
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,830
available to anyone wearing a ring:

278
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,040
Book and Gain.

279
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Place the hand with the ring in
front of you, and say, "Book."

280
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,760
Book.

281
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,180
In this game, your task is
to collect certain cards.

282
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,180
That book is for storing the
cards you've collected.

283
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,190
Please look at the first page.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,190
Each slot is labeled with a number.

285
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,480
You can only place cards of the
same number in these slots.

286
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,700
These are your "restricted slots."

287
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,200
Please flip ahead a few pages.

288
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,350
Wait, there aren't any numbers!

289
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,160
Yes, you may place any
card inside these slots.

290
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,210
These are your "free slots."

291
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,340
There are 100 restricted slots,
numbered 0 to 99.

292
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,840
Then, you have another 45 free slots.

293
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,100
To clear this game, you must
fill the 100 restricted slots.

294
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,920
I just need to collect a hundred cards?

295
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,850
Yes.

296
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,590
Specifically, you must
transform one hundred items

297
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,970
into cards and put them in your book.

298
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,860
Transform them?

299
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,310
For example, if you obtain a sword,

300
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,040
it will become a card
the moment you get it.

301
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,620
If you wish to use a card as the item,

302
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,850
you must use the spell "Gain."

303
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,720
Gain...

304
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,450
However, once you've used Gain to return

305
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,050
a card to item form, you can never

306
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,380
transform it into a card again.

307
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,070
If you want to make it a card again,
you must reacquire the item.

308
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,830
Do you understand everything so far?

309
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,890
Yeah, basically...

310
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,810
There are two other cases in which

311
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,990
you cannot transform
an item into a card.

312
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,220
The first is when you reach the item's

313
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,400
maximum card transformation limit.

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,620
Card transformation limit?

315
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,800
Yes, every item in this game has
a card transformation limit.

316
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,660
For example, if an item has a
transformation limit of three,

317
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,380
and three players have already

318
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,440
transformed the item into a card,

319
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,670
the fourth to find it will be
unable to change it into a card.

320
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,300
In the second case...

321
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,360
Huh?

322
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,810
If you don't place the card into
your book within one minute,

323
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,210
it will automatically revert to an item.

324
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,910
In this case, as well,

325
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,060
you can never transform
that item into a card again.

326
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,470
Do you understand?

327
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,570
Yeah, kinda...

328
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,570
Finally, the most important note...

329
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,070
I can't remember all of this...

330
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,430
If a player dies,

331
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,270
their book and ring are destroyed

332
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,830
and the book's contents are lost.

333
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,540
Does it matter anymore if you're dead?

334
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,090
That concludes my explanation.

335
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,040
You'll need to learn everything else

336
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,080
about the game by playing it.

337
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,600
Uh-huh, got it.

338
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
Thanks.

339
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,620
I wish you the best of luck.

340
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,580
Please take those stairs.

341
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,940
Loading save data.

342
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,610
I have a message from Ging Freecss.

343
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,490
From Ging?

344
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm glad to see you've made it, Gon.

345
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,560
My friends and I made this game.

346
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,150
Enjoy yourself.

347
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,200
But if you expected a clue to my
location, you're out of luck.

348
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,630
I just wanted to show
off this game to you.

349
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,380
It doesn't matter what brought you here.

350
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,580
Because you won't be able to leave

351
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,140
until you obtain a specific item.

352
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,250
So play away.

353
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,720
Gon has finally stepped foot inside

354
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,420
the legendary game Greed Island.

355
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,990
A new adventure is about to begin.

356
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:09,360
G.I. Tutorial

357
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

358
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,740
The descriptions on cards are written

359
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,440
in the Hunter language,

360
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,890
but we'll translate them

361
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,840
into Japanese for your convenience.

362
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,370
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.

363
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,620
Gain!

364
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,250
G.I. Tutorial

365
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

366
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,880
Next time: Invitation x and x Friend.

367
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Thanks, Gon.

368
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,130
Thanks, Killua.

369
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,460
Thanks, Gon!

370
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,800
Thanks, Killua!

371
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,970
You're embarrassing me!
