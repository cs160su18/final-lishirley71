00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,660
After Gon parts ways with Killua
in order to stop the selection,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,090
he finds himself under attack
by new Chimera Ants.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,310
An owl and a bat?

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,120
They're both nocturnal creatures...

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,020
Hunters of the night!

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,040
From the left?

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,160
Bring it!

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,730
The owl's feathers?

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,900
Damn...

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,620
The bat's wings are so loud,
I can't hear the owl at all!

12
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,010
Combination x And x Evolution

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,770
My ears can pick up sounds of
higher frequency than other animals'.

14
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,910
I can hear you stepping on leaves
and your clothes rustling.

15
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,280
All of which tell me exactly where you are!

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,530
From the right this time!

17
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,230
The owl uses its feathers to distract me

18
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,290
right before the bat attacks...

19
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,790
They're using both long- and short-range attacks.

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,720
Wait...

21
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,170
That means...

22
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,350
He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.

23
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,850
We are unrivaled in the darkness!

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,960
I should approach this the opposite way!

25
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,400
If the owl is acting in a support role,

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,540
I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.

27
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,610
Right after the owl attacks,
the bat will attack!

28
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,100
Now!

29
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,240
Bingo!

30
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,430
I missed?

31
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,690
But my timing was perfect!

32
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,370
Ultrasonic waves?

33
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,250
Damn, I missed again?

34
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,940
Bah, he's correctly guessing
the direction of my attacks.

35
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,510
For a human, his ears are sharp.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,000
And his aura keeps growing,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,920
so my feathers aren't doing any damage.

38
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,880
The bat uses ultrasonic waves to
anticipate the timing of my attack.

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,610
Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!

40
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,810
First comes rock...

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,580
His aura continues to grow.

42
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,250
This could pose a problem.

43
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,160
Not at all...

44
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,020
This is our chance.

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,130
He's probably using his ultimate attack.

46
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,170
If we can evade it, we've won.

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,170
I can use my ultrasonic waves
to see it in advance.

48
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,990
Do you need help?

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,300
Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can.

50
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,930
The sound's moving away.

51
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,820
The sound's gone!

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,580
Now, with no wingbeats...

53
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,820
I dive!

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,330
That won't work!

55
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,080
Your wings aren't like the owl's,
so I can hear you slice through the air.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,830
Now, show me your ultimate attack.

57
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,230
He isn't acting?

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,660
I guess a human can only hear so much.

59
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,480
In that case, I'll make my move...

60
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,370
I'll slash your jugular!

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,100
Keep my motions minimal.

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,350
Wait until I draw her as near as possible!

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,300
He was baiting me?

64
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm in trouble.

65
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,440
But his punch will take a
few milliseconds to land.

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,670
I have plenty of time to fly away!

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,790
The noise...

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,980
I can't see.

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,980
I must get away!

70
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,960
You won't escape!

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,790
Rock...

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,090
You aren't the only one that can use sound...

73
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,920
Paper...

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,720
...to locate others.

75
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,350
Paper!

76
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,350
All right.

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,040
A rock?

78
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,410
He used that to deflect my shot?

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,940
Gorilla Mode

80
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,400
That was close...

81
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,420
Damn it!

82
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,730
I used my special attack and
still couldn't bring it down!

83
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,700
What was that?

84
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,140
There was a sound that made my head spin.

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,340
Is this ultrasound, too?

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,880
That stupid kid has a loud voice...

87
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,970
But I'm much better at attacking with sound!

88
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,900
This is the true power of their combination.

89
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,230
They strike with sound and finish with brawn.

90
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,730
What now?

91
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,500
Do I cover my ears?

92
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,720
No, I can't...

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,230
In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing,
my reaction time will suffer.

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,280
I know!

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,610
Gyo!

96
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,620
His eyes are shining?

97
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,370
Or is that aura?

98
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,370
He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?

99
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,120
Let's give him another...

100
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,120
Ultrasonic Dissonance

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Secret Noise!

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,610
Okay!

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,970
This should help some.

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,420
He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...

105
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,890
Water significantly weakens the power of sound!

106
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,950
Good, this is better...

107
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,030
I can locate the owl through its aura.

108
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,740
Here it comes!

109
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,240
A feather?

110
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,650
Zetsu.

111
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,860
Of course... They started off as wild animals.

112
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,100
From birth, they've known
to conceal themselves

113
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,130
when approaching their prey!

114
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,160
I can fend off their attacks,
but the ultrasound really hurts.

115
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,020
If I don't keep up the Gyo,

116
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,640
they'll take me down before
I can even find them!

117
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,320
In terms of latent aura,
the kid has a clear advantage.

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,150
Even after being hit all those times,
he's taken no damage.

119
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,920
But his level of capability is irrelevant.

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,710
Without a strategy, he's just a moving target.

121
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,190
They work in perfect sync.

122
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,040
I have to disrupt that!

123
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,800
Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top
of me, we can't use ultrasound.

124
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,350
Wrong guess!

125
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,400
If I use Rock, I can defeat this one.

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,770
But then the bat might run
and warn the other Ants!

127
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,430
To me, a starry night is as bright as day.

128
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,010
As long as I'm not in total darkness,

129
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,070
I can see you without needing
to rely on my hearing!

130
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,160
So if I cover my ears...

131
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,580
I can attack at will!

132
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,620
The kid has shrouded his entire
body in aura to avoid damage.

133
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,770
But that reduces the strength of his attacks,
making it impossible to stand against them.

134
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,890
At this rate, he'll never defeat them...

135
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,600
It's over for this kid.

136
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,610
Their weakness is that

137
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,850
their movements are always in sync!

138
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,110
Here!

139
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,790
They always take positions on opposite sides

140
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,850
to avoid both being targeted at once.

141
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,660
When the owl is in front of me,

142
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,000
the bat is directly behind me!

143
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,250
A giant wall?

144
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,620
The real wall was

145
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,020
behind me...

146
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,030
He turned our teamwork against us?

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,280
If I only have one opponent,
I can concentrate on attacking.

148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,590
Once he pulls off one plan,
things will go his way...

149
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,380
But that attack won't be enough
to get him anywhere here.

150
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,850
Damn!

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
First comes rock...

152
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,900
Rock... Paper...

153
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,050
Why, you...

154
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,230
Rock!

155
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,190
I made sure to knock you west!

156
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,590
Go back to NGL!

157
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,710
That was incredibly strong...

158
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,700
I see... This is his real ultimate attack.

159
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,580
I take back what I said.

160
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,950
This kid can be useful.

161
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,700
But how do I proceed?

162
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,210
Diego has been dethroned.

163
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,840
Brainwashed soldiers are running around,
slaughtering entire villages and towns!

164
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,900
Diego has fallen?

165
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,270
Is that true?

166
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,220
But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.

167
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,090
There's no time to think about it!

168
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,100
Just leave this village and run, anywhere!

169
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,740
Warn people in other areas!

170
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,970
Who's interfering?

171
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,020
It was in the southeast this time.

172
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,200
Some of my puppets have been stopped.

173
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,740
That was fast.

174
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,680
Whoever they are, they're keeping
low and unpredictable.

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,820
An assassin?

176
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,750
But they are acting on their own...

177
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,460
A decoy?

178
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,290
This is so annoying...

179
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,380
I wanna kill them!

180
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,990
It is no more than a diversion.

181
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,890
Which means we cannot go.

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,900
You think?

183
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,140
But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.

184
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,900
They're being careful not to let me catch them...

185
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,540
It may all be an act to draw you out.

186
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,070
But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,400
But... But...

188
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,660
Ah, how I long to indulge myself
in the delight of agonizing...

189
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,690
It is the sweet trap of the thought process.

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,850
Nothing more.

191
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,620
The answer is simple.

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,900
Our mission is to protect the King.

193
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,160
We can let the other Ants handle the rest.

194
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,930
Is it our turn?

195
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,810
When we were injured

196
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,710
and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in.

197
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,640
You even gave us instruction on using our power.

198
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,700
It is time for us to return the favor!

199
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,450
Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.

200
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,090
Can you kill them?

201
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,040
You can count on me.

202
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,960
Take this cell phone.

203
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,960
We can't use telepathy.

204
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,690
I'll give you updates on their location.

205
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,990
Understood.

206
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,980
Can we really trust them?

207
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,100
Nah, I don't trust them.

208
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,020
They're the ones trying to earn our trust,

209
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,700
so they'll try hard to carry out their mission.

210
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,610
It's possible that they're looking for an
opportunity to stab us in the back.

211
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,280
In that case, we should treat them accordingly.

212
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,370
The closest village is at two o'clock.

213
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,630
The next closest villages are
at eight and ten o'clock...

214
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,630
Should I skip them and head for
Taba, forty kilometers away?

215
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,390
Play it safe...

216
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,140
Don't let anyone find me.

217
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,150
I can't go this way.

218
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,770
This is bad...

219
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,180
I should have taken matters into my own hands.

220
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,110
What's wrong?

221
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,470
As we speak, Cheetu is racing
toward East Gorteau.

222
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,090
It seems the Hunters that replaced
us failed to capture him.

223
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,950
Is he headed toward us?

224
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,690
No, if he continues on his current
course, he'll pass far to the south.

225
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,690
Where are you going?

226
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,430
Don't try to stop me...

227
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,950
I'm already in a bad mood.

228
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,980
The Hunter Association has captured three
hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants

229
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,170
outside of NGL as of yesterday.

230
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,460
But Colt confirmed that none of
them were Squadron Leaders.

231
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,410
According to him,

232
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,950
there are eight Squadron Leaders left
that would be considered aggressive.

233
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,470
Hunters have encountered four,
but they all got away.

234
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,100
Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.

235
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,680
He must know the King is here.

236
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,730
He's choosing to return to the King's
service in order to increase his power.

237
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,360
My ability is still in effect,
and I have more raw strength.

238
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,650
But if we let him slip away and
he gains even more power,

239
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,740
there's no telling who will win next time.

240
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,000
If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,

241
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,470
we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away.

242
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,410
Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?

243
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,210
If you are, I'll fight you first.

244
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,240
First, we contact Morel-san.

245
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,270
If worse comes to worst,
he'll need to replace us.

246
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,270
I'll come with you.

247
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,510
This should increase the odds
of capturing that Ant.

248
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,620
It's Knuckle... Something's come up.

249
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,330
Yes, I'd guess so.

250
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,030
Probably.

251
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,470
Yes.

252
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,290
So, uh...

253
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,550
Hello? Hello?

254
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,040
Fools!

255
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,820
I told you to send Riakke!

256
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,450
He'd have been perfect for this.

257
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,910
Huh?!

258
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,800
I don't give a damn!

259
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,060
What's wrong?

260
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.

261
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,420
The review board didn't send
the Hunter we requested!

262
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,840
Who did they send?

263
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,570
Some Hunter I've never heard of.

264
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,340
Probably an Association dog.

265
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,820
An Association dog...

266
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,590
You mean Hunters who only take jobs
through the Hunter Association.

267
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,330
It isn't surprising that they have less talent.

268
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,810
Damn! I should have gone
to talk to Riakke myself!

269
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,400
Don't be foolish!

270
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,830
If you do anything without board approval,

271
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,840
the Chairman will get all the grief.

272
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,350
He had to argue with the executive
committee just to get the two of us here.

273
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,240
But they don't understand the situation.

274
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,610
They base it on past accomplishments
and donations to the Association...

275
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,890
The review board has always been inflexible.

276
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,620
How can you be so relaxed?!

277
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,780
If we underestimate the Squadron
Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it.

278
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,090
They're strong.

279
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,540
After all, they listen to their deepest desires.

280
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,400
So they have the talent to quickly master

281
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,180
the abilities they need the most.

282
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,510
If we let the review board bring self-preservation
and formality in, we won't get help in time.

283
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,060
Maybe that's their goal...

284
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,030
You refer to the rumors that
the Vice-Chairman's faction

285
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,070
controls the review board?

286
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,410
That they're only giving work to Hunters

287
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,550
who agree to vote for him in the next election?

288
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,260
There's no evidence of anything
like that happening.

289
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,630
You think they're stupid enough to get caught?

290
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,850
Look at the facts!

291
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,480
They've let every Squadron Leader
they've faced escape alive!

292
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,150
If this expedition fails,
the Chairman will shoulder the blame.

293
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,010
They're willing to do whatever it
takes to guarantee that result.

294
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,400
As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,

295
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,610
the voices calling for the Chairman's
resignation grow louder.

296
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,110
Too bad the voices belong to a bunch
of people sitting at their desks!

297
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,190
If we take out the King and five million
people are already dead, we've failed!

298
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,170
We already knew that.

299
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,120
The Chairman is prepared.

300
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,400
When he developed this plan, he was
well aware of the consequences.

301
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,520
He knew how long assuring victory would take,

302
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,630
and the resulting casualties...

303
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,640
Five million is the low end...

304
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,200
That's too high!

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,230
Marcos-san?

306
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,150
What?

307
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,150
The phones have been ringing nonstop!

308
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,910
Rumors of a coup d'état are flying around.

309
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,150
And it's been discovered that mass murders
are taking place all over the nation.

310
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,860
This is no rumor. It's actually happening!

311
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,580
What's going on here?

312
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,670
Are you responsible for this?

313
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,790
We haven't done anything!

314
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,920
The citizens have learned the
truth about the selection?

315
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,080
We'll discuss this later.

316
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,090
Return to the office before anyone suspects you.

317
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:05,920
Morel!

318
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,190
Our beloved leader, Diego, has an
urgent announcement to make.

319
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,940
To ensure that our great leader's message
will be heard throughout the nation,

320
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,680
we request that relay speakers in all
regions be turned to maximum volume.

321
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,200
All televisions and radios should be on,
and the volume raised to maximum.

322
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,440
Good evening, my beloved comrades.

323
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,070
I am Diego.

324
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,800
I have just declared that East
Gorteau is under martial law.

325
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,220
This precaution is being taken to combat
malcontents that would foment rebellion.

326
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,260
I ask all comrades to stay indoors,
with your doors locked.

327
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,540
Anyone outdoors without permission will
be identified as a rebel and punished.

328
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,750
I ask that you not lend an ear
to false rumors being spread,

329
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,210
but that you follow my instructions.

330
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,680
The soldiers of my special forces
will be visiting your residences,

331
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,240
to see if any rebels are hiding inside.

332
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,250
Do not open your doors for anyone else.

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,800
Their response was too fast.

334
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,680
It must be Killua and Gon.

335
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,290
They weren't supposed to act.

336
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,870
But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.

337
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,510
They were so well-prepared,
I can't believe otherwise.

338
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,970
The citizens learning the truth about
the selection wasn't important.

339
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,330
In fact, if they did, the military
would have an excuse to mobilize.

340
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,770
East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,

341
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,620
completely isolated from the rest of the world.

342
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,480
Hmm... No problem.

343
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,400
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.

344
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,060
I will stop them all.

345
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,900
Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.

346
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,840
98!

347
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,540
99!

348
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,270
100!

349
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,410
We want to thank everyone...

350
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,570
...for helping us reach 100 episodes!

351
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,420
Thank you!

352
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,760
We hope you keep watching!
