00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,980
Your technique

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,980
has two huge weaknesses!

4
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,990
Compassion x And x Strength

5
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,510
Gon has finally challenged
Knuckle to a serious fight.

6
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,500
However, Knuckle claims that
Gon's technique has serious flaws.

7
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,550
So, Gon...

8
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,300
What did you name that technique?

9
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,010
Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.

10
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,170
Ja-Janken!

11
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,310
Wow, zero effort...

12
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,050
Jajanken...

13
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,910
I understand.

14
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,200
You combined "jajan" for "ta-dah," with
"janken" for your attack, "Rock-Paper-Scissors."

15
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,190
Ah, no...

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
The first "ja" was a stutter.

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,620
Not a bad name, kid!

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,140
Uh, yeah.

19
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,690
Guess I'm okay with that.

20
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,840
You are?!

21
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,010
Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses.

22
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,970
First, it takes too long to charge.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,360
During a fight, you don't have time
to stand still for several seconds.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,780
I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.

25
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,240
I know that.

26
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,860
Second, it's too risky.

27
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,260
When you focus aura in your
fist to increase power,

28
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,890
you have less aura for defense.

29
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,750
One attack to the wrong place
will take you out, fool!

30
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,320
I know the risks.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,760
That's why I've spent the past month
training to compensate for them!

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,090
Now that I see it again,
his aura really is something.

33
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,150
In terms of volume, he has
as much as a mid-level pro.

34
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,020
He's so close...

35
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,690
But you still lack

36
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,780
experience.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,730
You haven't been in

38
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,290
enough real fights!

39
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,970
You've got plenty of determination.

40
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,130
It seems you've looked death
in the eye many times,

41
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,300
and you have natural talent.

42
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,230
However, you're still unrefined.

43
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,600
Your aura is too rough!

44
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,490
I can tell which area you're defending.

45
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,030
I can see what you're trying to do.

46
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,440
Your aura gives it all away.

47
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,490
So if I use that information to fake you out,

48
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,450
shifting your intended point of attack...

49
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,500
This is the result!

50
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,310
Damn...

51
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,350
His aura is giving away his every move!

52
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,610
I was right! Knuckle really is...

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,030
Okay, then...

54
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,110
Time to throw a real punch.

55
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,860
He's so...

56
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,140
Don't blame me if you die.

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,870
He's so gentle!

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
Behind you, fool!

59
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,920
Without his warning, I could have died.

60
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,970
First, it takes too long to charge.

61
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,800
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...

62
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,850
And providing guidance.

63
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,860
He's telling me how to become stronger.

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,860
He's too gentle!

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,060
First comes rock...

66
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I told you that you won't pull off that attack.

67
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
Don't fool around with me!

68
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,850
That was your full strength?

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,280
Which one of us is fooling around?!

70
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,850
It's supposed to be a serious fight!

71
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!

72
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,700
First comes rock...

73
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,000
Here I go!

74
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,500
Rock...

75
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,100
Over here!

76
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,890
First comes rock...

77
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,390
Rock...

78
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Bastard...

79
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,120
He faked me out with his Jajanken.

80
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,770
It's obvious that you're focused
on stopping my special attack.

81
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,130
Even I could tell exactly when your
right arm was going to strike.

82
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,770
He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long
charge time, against his opponent.

83
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,470
He's playing mind games.

84
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,910
Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.

85
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,630
He has to swing for it.

86
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,770
It's a perfect pitch, right down the
middle, that he has to send flying.

87
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,280
That's the trigger.

88
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,660
When you see the easy ball, you tense up.

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,410
You can hit it. You have to.

90
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,910
These thoughts make you use
more strength than necessary.

91
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,860
The same thing applies to aura.

92
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,550
If a Nen user doesn't control their aura,

93
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,580
it will gather in areas of tension.

94
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,440
The moment of the swing, it intensifies further.

95
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,620
If the Nen user is inexperienced or out of control,

96
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,470
the aura will either stagnate
or just flow too freely.

97
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,160
The flow of the aura

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,310
lets the opponent sense
when an attack will come.

99
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,820
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!

100
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,820
By calling him out for being soft,
Gon threw Knuckle off.

101
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,320
As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out.

102
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,690
I'd think this tactic would be more effective
on those who know Jajanken's strength.

103
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,920
Opponents who have seen how
strong the technique can be

104
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,180
will be more scared and likely to lose
control when they see it coming.

105
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,380
The fake-out will be more believable,

106
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,740
and if the enemy steps back,

107
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,230
they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper.

108
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,470
I always assumed Jajanken

109
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,830
would be less useful once opponents
figured out how it works.

110
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,080
That it was flawed.

111
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,300
But I was wrong.

112
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,060
It can be adapted to any situation.

113
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,360
Okay, let's try this again.

114
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,400
In the second attempt, he was
too focused on the technique

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,340
and let Knuckle land a kick on him.

116
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,140
But if he learns to better control his aura
in response to the opponent's movement,

117
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,970
it will be harder to distinguish between

118
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,500
fake and real Jajanken attempts.

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,260
Gon's been thinking how to shore
up his technique's weaknesses.

120
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,630
No...

121
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,450
He thought of the solution during this fight.

122
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,520
He's making incredible progress while fighting.

123
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm already getting tired.

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,690
We haven't even been
fighting for twenty minutes.

125
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Moving so much is sapping my energy.

126
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,790
If an hour of training is comparable
to ten minutes of fighting,

127
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,170
I'll only be able to maintain my Ken for another ten minutes.

128
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,890
If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished.

129
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,170
Before then, I have to end this.

130
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
By using Jajanken.

131
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,810
Bring it!

132
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,680
Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.

133
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,950
But Gon is adapting, little by little.

134
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,430
By increasing the area his aura covers,

135
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,590
he reduces the damage from miscalculations.

136
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,680
And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.

137
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,620
Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,460
But he's running out of time.

139
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,970
He doesn't have much stamina
left to maintain his aura.

140
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,390
On the other hand, Knuckle has
been conserving his strength,

141
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,480
only attacking with physical blows.

142
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,600
Jajanken requires a large
amount of aura just to charge.

143
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,990
A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.

144
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,670
Gon's already activated his technique three times.

145
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,960
They started fighting twenty minutes ago.

146
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,300
If he uses Jajanken again,
he'll only have a minute or two

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,160
to fight at full strength.

148
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,540
Gon...

149
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,980
You told me to use my full strength,

150
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,110
but you're no match for me right now.

151
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,690
You're...

152
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,360
First comes

153
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,700
rock...

154
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,200
Why?

155
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,020
What...

156
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
is he going to do?

157
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,500
First comes

158
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,600
rock...

159
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,670
Why?

160
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,480
Knuckle's in good shape and alert,
and he's attacking from that distance?

161
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,980
He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.

162
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,190
This is definitely Gon's final attack.

163
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,370
This will end it.

164
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,040
Rock... Scissors...

165
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,370
Paper!

166
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,050
An Emitter attack?

167
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,140
But it's much weaker than his Rock.

168
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,390
You're definitely an Enhancer.

169
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,020
Your power as an Emitter is far lower.

170
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,050
No speed... No punch.

171
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,900
He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.

172
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,150
Once I knock that aside, it's over!

173
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,740
Once again!

174
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,870
Once again?

175
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,370
He used that ball as cover
to move behind me?

176
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,000
Crap!

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,350
Two Jajankens in a row...

178
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,880
Rock!

179
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,340
He must have depleted his
aura before Rock hit.

180
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,720
Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground...

181
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,310
Where are you going, fool?

182
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm going back.

183
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,220
Aren't you going to fight?

184
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm fine here.

185
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,810
You can fight Gon again tomorrow.

186
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,810
The outcome will probably be different.

187
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,660
I'll defeat Shoot.

188
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,430
Tell Gon this.

189
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,940
Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real.

190
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,080
He'd better be prepared to die.

191
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,610
It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.

192
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,590
Sure you're up to the task?

193
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,910
Hell, yeah, fool.

194
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,050
Tomorrow...

195
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,420
As long as you win,

196
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,900
it's fine if you don't get serious.

197
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,310
But if you lose without fighting at full strength,

198
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,100
I won't forgive you.

199
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,010
I'll never forgive you, as long as I live.

200
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,260
You're still soft.

201
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,940
Why are you helping the enemy?

202
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,880
And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well...

203
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,140
If you don't want to go to NGL,
hand over your token to them.

204
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,930
Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.

205
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,800
Bastard...

206
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,620
You're pretty cocky when you aren't
shaking in your boots, eh?

207
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,490
The past month, all you've done is stalk them!

208
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,900
I'll fight.

209
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,860
Tomorrow, I'll join the fight.

210
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,370
Don't worry.

211
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,780
I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight

212
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,750
in top condition tomorrow.

213
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,540
Killua's the real issue...

214
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,920
I wasn't expecting him to go

215
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,870
the whole month without fighting once.

216
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
Killua!

217
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,820
Fight me.

218
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,150
Huh?

219
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,330
What happened to your face, Killua?!

220
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,080
Huh? I was training with Bisky.

221
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,860
Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?

222
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,900
Anyway, are you feeling okay?

223
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,220
Yep, I feel great.

224
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,060
I used up all my aura, so I expected
to be tired, but look!

225
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,040
That gorill—

226
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,310
That old hag's massage must have done the trick.

227
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,730
That was close.

228
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,200
Listen now...

229
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,470
If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,

230
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,610
I'll make your face three times worse.

231
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,240
She wasn't joking.

232
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,650
Now, do you know your weakness?

233
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,750
You're too quick to give up.

234
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,790
You're too cautious about fighting.

235
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,380
Some might say you underestimate yourself.

236
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,960
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

237
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,880
you fight on the premise of escaping.

238
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,090
I realize that this isn't your fault.

239
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,720
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.

240
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,470
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.

241
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,050
But I can say one thing for sure.

242
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,050
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

243
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,360
Combat ability can change,

244
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,560
depending on environment
and physical condition.

245
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,620
For example, a good-condition C

246
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,190
has a high chance of defeating
a poor-condition D.

247
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,950
If the conditions are right, A, B, and C

248
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,920
all have the potential to defeat D.

249
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,700
But in your case, you're assuming

250
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,970
the enemy is always at their best.

251
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,260
You always assume the worst-case scenario.

252
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,770
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,

253
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,800
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.

254
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,210
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...

255
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,730
You don't bother to think of how you could win.

256
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,530
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.

257
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,070
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself

258
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,740
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.

259
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,540
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

260
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,350
you must leave Gon's side.

261
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,760
Okay! I'm gonna win this time!

262
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,880
Let's go.

263
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,530
Yeah.

264
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,330
Killua's overly cautious style is the
product of a smothering love.

265
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,720
A twisted, self-serving love...

266
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,320
That just makes his habits stronger,
deeper, and harder to break.

267
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,950
Without extraordinary willpower,
this curse cannot be broken.

268
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,230
I don't know who will emerge victorious...

269
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,330
All right, then...

270
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,730
Time to run for it.

271
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,030
The loser...

272
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,920
Hands his token to the winner.

273
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,800
Gon and Knuckle.

274
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,270
Killua and Shoot.

275
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,480
Their final battle begins.

276
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,760
Next time: Slow x And x Cursed.

277
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,240
Who are you calling slow, fool?

278
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,140
Are you saying I'm cursed, fool?
