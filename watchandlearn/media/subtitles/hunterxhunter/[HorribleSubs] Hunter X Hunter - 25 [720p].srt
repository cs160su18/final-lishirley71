00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,040
In the Dentora region

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,300
of the Republic of Padokea,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,300
Kukuroo Mountain.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,520
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,010
Lamentation Tours

11
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,240
I understand.

12
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,430
You're free now.

13
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,840
But...

14
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,060
Promise me one thing.

15
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,230
Never betray your friends.

16
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,980
Understand?

17
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,490
I promise.

18
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,450
I'll never betray them.

19
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,570
Never.

20
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,580
Can't See x If x You're Blind

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,750
After a discussion with the father he admires,

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,050
Killua leaves his home again,

23
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,590
despite his mother's objections.

24
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,380
Gon and his friends are led by Canary

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,000
to the butler's office,
to attempt to meet with Killua.

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,480
Aren't we there yet?

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,300
We still have a while to go.

28
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,780
How much walking do we have to do...

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,850
Honestly, I cannot believe this!

30
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,000
Kil was finally home!

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,630
But the men allowed him to leave again!

32
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,110
And Father is just as guilty!

33
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,920
He released Kil without permission!

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Really,

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,150
this always happens!

36
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,430
They never ask me before they act.

37
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,750
Do you understand, Gotoh?

38
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,250
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,060
Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...

40
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,150
Why don't they understand?

41
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,270
He's the one child I shall not give up!

42
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,940
There it is.

43
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,460
That building?

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,270
But it's still pretty far away.

45
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,980
Say, Canary.

46
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,550
Won't you get in trouble
for bringing us here?

47
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,720
They already know what I'm doing.

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,210
So I am prepared to take the consequences.

49
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,100
If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility.

50
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,840
No.

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,610
I'm merely serving as a guide
for Killua-sama's friends.

52
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,000
Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,750
Gotoh, where's Gon now?

54
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,520
You do know, right?

55
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,760
Canary is bringing Gon-sama here,

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,550
along with his two friends.

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,260
Really?

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,020
They should arrive shortly,
so please wait inside.

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,140
Okay.

60
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,150
Gotoh.

61
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,900
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,390
Let me know the second Gon gets here.

63
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,540
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,290
I shall notify you immediately.

65
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,420
Forgive me, Killua-sama.

66
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,920
Hey, we finally made it.

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,050
Welcome.

68
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,440
Please forgive the rude reception.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,820
The lady of the house has
asked us to treat you

70
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,290
as official guests.

71
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Is that better?

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,950
Thanks.

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,800
Then this is not the primary residence?

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,210
No, this place is for the butlers.

75
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,470
Well, please make yourselves at home.

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,040
I appreciate the hospitality,

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,350
but we've come to see Killua.

78
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,190
Can you take us to him at once?

79
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,730
That won't be necessary.

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,730
Killua-sama is on his way here.

81
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,030
Really?

82
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,860
Yes, so please wait a little longer.

83
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,560
That's great news, Gon!

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,470
Yeah!

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,120
Now, then...

86
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,620
To simply sit and wait would be dull.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,500
How about a game, to pass the time?

88
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,000
A game?

89
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,390
Which hand holds the coin?

90
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,640
The left hand.

91
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,900
Correct.

92
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,000
So I'll move more quickly this time.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,570
Well? Which hand?

94
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,320
Left again.

95
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,060
Marvelous.

96
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,840
Then I shall try harder this time.

97
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,960
Well? Which hand?

98
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,440
I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right.

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,210
You see...

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,730
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.

101
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,720
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.

102
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,720
In all honesty,

103
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,600
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.

104
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,610
Well? Which hand?

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,610
Answer.

106
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,610
The left hand.

107
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,110
His lady mother could barely speak...

108
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,880
She must be heartbroken,
having to watch him leave.

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,880
I cannot forgive it.

110
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,630
By the time Killua-sama arrives,
a decision will be reached.

111
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,880
I shall test you in my own way.

112
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,010
You have no choice.

113
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,540
Canary!

114
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,230
This is her punishment for having
brought you here, against her orders.

115
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,730
I shall explain the rules.

116
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,790
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.

117
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,370
Should you all be disqualified,

118
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,940
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.

119
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,250
And that he will never see you again.

120
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,230
Killua is...

121
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,500
Silence!

122
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,290
Your lives hang by a thread.

123
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,730
Now, answer my question.

124
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,640
Which hand?

125
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,400
I couldn't see it...

126
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,920
Don't take too long.

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,780
You have three seconds to answer.

128
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,300
Hey...

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,880
After three seconds have passed,
slit her throat.

130
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,660
Okay.

131
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,670
Wait! Left hand!

132
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,900
I pick the right hand!

133
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,960
Me, too!

134
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,880
One disqualified.

135
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
This is futile.

136
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,760
I can't see anything!

137
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,140
Which hand?

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
I choose the right hand.

139
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,900
I pick the left.

140
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,630
It was in my left hand.

141
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,400
Only one remains now.

142
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,350
Here I go.

143
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,370
One second!

144
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,110
What is it?

145
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,210
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.

146
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,540
Leorio, lend me your knife.

147
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,210
Huh?

148
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,780
Don't worry.

149
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,890
I won't use it for anything stupid.

150
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
That's it...

151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,520
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.

152
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,230
Man, how long do I have to wait?

153
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,480
Hey, Gotoh!

154
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,240
Anyone around?

155
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,980
What's going on?

156
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,610
Okay!

157
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,830
Now I can see.

158
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,000
Give me your best!

159
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,460
Which hand?

160
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,090
Left hand.

161
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,950
Not bad.

162
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,910
In that case...

163
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,060
Who now holds the coin?

164
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:24,160
Hunter Vocabulary

165
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,160
Waiting Time

166
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,290
The person right behind me.

167
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,110
Brilliant.

168
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,030
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?

169
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,700
Killua!

170
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,920
Oh! You're here, Gon!

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,500
Along with...

172
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,420
Kurapika?

173
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,940
I'm just an afterthought?

174
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,050
Liorio!

175
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,530
Leorio!

176
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,550
It's been a while.

177
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,830
I can't believe you came.
What happened?

178
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,080
Your face is a wreck!

179
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,200
Yours isn't any better!

180
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,690
Hey, Gotoh.

181
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,500
I told you to let me know
as soon as they arrived.

182
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,850
What were you doing?

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,700
Forgive me.

184
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,720
I had them participate in a little game.

185
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,230
A game?

186
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,290
It was nothing more than a poor joke.

187
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,600
I apologize for any aggravation.

188
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,800
Did you enjoy yourselves?

189
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,720
That was really good acting...

190
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,110
What? Did they try something?

191
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,490
No, they were entertaining us.

192
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,640
Really?

193
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,850
Well, whatever.

194
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,010
Anyway, let's go somewhere else.
Anywhere else, right now.

195
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,910
If we stay here, my mother
will give us an earful!

196
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,620
Yeah!

197
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,830
Hey, Gotoh.

198
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,800
Listen up.

199
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,630
I don't care what Mother says.
Don't follow me.

200
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,380
Understood. Please take care.

201
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,950
Gon, let's go.

202
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,590
Bye.

203
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,100
Gotoh-san.

204
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,680
Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?

205
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,110
No.

206
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,900
We butlers feel no emotional attachment

207
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,610
to our employers.

208
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,730
You're lying.

209
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
Gon-kun...

210
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,500
Well? Which hand?

211
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,380
Isn't it your left hand?

212
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,870
What? No way!

213
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,630
Indeed. It was a deception.

214
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,640
In this world, there are many
things that are wrong.

215
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,640
Please be careful.

216
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,900
I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.

217
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,150
Bye, Canary!

218
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,530
Took you long enough, Gon!

219
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,850
Sorry about that.

220
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's make ourselves scarce
before more trouble comes.

221
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,920
Yeah, he's used that trick on me before.

222
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,590
Once you know the secret,
it's so simple, it'll make you mad.

223
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,380
Huh? Really?

224
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm assuming this was what he did.

225
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,390
Which hand?

226
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,430
It's your left hand, right?

227
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,390
Huh? How?

228
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,930
Hey, how did you do that?

229
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,060
Gotoh held two coins.

230
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,390
Huh? But he only had the one.

231
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,520
Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand,

232
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,820
while flipping the other.

233
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,680
And then he let us see him grab
the coin using his left hand.

234
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,300
But before he asked us
which hand held the coin,

235
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,000
he raised both arms,

236
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,500
and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve.

237
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,110
That left the coin in his right hand.

238
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,170
You got it.

239
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,140
That really makes me mad.

240
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,540
Well, I'm fairly certain he only used
the trick on the final turn.

241
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,260
Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game.

242
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,100
That's even worse!

243
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,900
What?

244
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,800
You're here on a tourist visa?

245
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,530
Uh-huh.

246
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,980
Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?

247
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,230
You could've just used your Hunter License.

248
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,120
It lets you stay in other countries
for as long as you want.

249
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,670
That's what we said.

250
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,080
I already decided.

251
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,170
I'm not using the license until I've
finished what I need to do.

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,870
What do you have to do?

253
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,680
The tag

254
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,310
that Hisoka gave me!

255
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,170
I'll only take it back

256
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,940
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,450
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

258
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,450
I'll return it to Hisoka when
I punch him in the face!

259
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,320
Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License.

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
I can't go back to Whale Island, either.

261
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,470
Hmm...

262
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,230
So, where's Hisoka?

263
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,540
Uh...

264
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,420
Thought so...

265
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,720
I know where he is, Gon.

266
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,340
Huh? Really?

267
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,130
How?

268
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,850
He told me.

269
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,230
So that's what he said...

270
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,980
No, this was after the orientation.

271
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,260
But it's still related, right?

272
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,480
I suppose so.

273
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,420
I've been itching to ask...

274
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,860
What did Hisoka say to you?

275
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,370
He told me...

276
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,540
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.

277
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,170
The Phantom Troupe?

278
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,580
I do not recall mentioning the
Phantom Troupe to Hisoka.

279
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,100
So either he overheard our conversation
during the first stage,

280
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,680
or he heard of it from another.

281
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,070
The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol,

282
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,560
so those familiar with the organization
refer to the Troupe as such.

283
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,560
I was interested in his information.

284
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,520
I see...

285
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,030
So that's why you swallowed your pride

286
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,570
and accepted Hisoka's surrender.

287
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,070
After the orientation, I asked him about it.

288
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,620
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.

289
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,000
September 1st?

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,590
Then you've still got over half a year.

291
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,230
What's going to happen in Yorknew City?

292
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,250
They'll hold the world's largest auction.

293
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,710
Correct.

294
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,390
From September 1st through September 10th,

295
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,740
there will be an auction

296
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,600
for unusual items, rare goods,

297
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,760
and national treasures from around the world.

298
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,090
The event attracts all manner of nasty folk

299
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,730
who come looking to satisfy their greed.

300
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,520
It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.

301
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,570
So the Troupe will be there?

302
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,490
They're a group of bandits.

303
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,530
They would not let this chance escape.

304
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,540
So on that day, Hisoka will be
somewhere in Yorknew City.

305
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,440
Okay. September 1st.

306
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,540
Got it. Thanks.

307
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,900
Then I shall depart now.

308
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,550
Huh?

309
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,720
We managed to see Killua again,
so I'm finished here.

310
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll need money to participate in the auction.

311
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,940
So I shall search for a patron
to employ me as a Hunter.

312
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,320
Really...

313
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,790
I guess I should go home, then.

314
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,820
You, too?

315
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,940
I haven't given up my dream
of becoming a doctor.

316
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,660
If I'm accepted to medical school,

317
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,700
I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.

318
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll have to go back and start cramming.

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,010
Uh-huh, good luck.

320
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,370
Until we meet again.

321
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,340
Yes, that will be...

322
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,350
September 1st, in Yorknew City.

323
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,700
See ya.

324
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,350
Bye-bye!

325
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,880
It's just the two of us now.

326
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,680
Hey, what do you want to do?

327
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,490
You have to ask? We train, obviously.

328
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,350
Huh? Train for what?

329
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,550
Shouldn't we have some fun?

330
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you remember what you just said?

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,500
Think you can punch Hisoka in
the face without training?

332
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,500
You couldn't land a punch

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
in ten years, let alone six months!

334
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,900
Okay.

335
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,930
Here, I'll make it easy to understand.

336
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,300
This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.

337
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,260
Uh-huh...

338
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,820
If this is the gap between Hisoka
and Hanzo, in terms of strength,

339
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,420
the gap between Hisoka and you

340
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,640
is this far!

341
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,330
And I'm being generous.

342
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,400
Now I'm mad...

343
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,730
Then where are you?

344
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,800
Me?

345
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,090
Well, probably around here.

346
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,720
Yep... I'm so humble.

347
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,420
Oh, Hanzo is stronger?

348
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,850
What is it?

349
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,700
You really are amazing!

350
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,050
Cut that out... It's embarrassing.

351
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,210
I don't know how to tell the
difference in strength

352
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,730
between my opponent and myself.

353
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,010
Stupid. It doesn't matter.

354
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,810
I'm only estimating.

355
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,810
You probably have a general idea.

356
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,680
Once you have enough experience,

357
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,120
your guess will become more accurate.

358
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,800
Besides, the stronger someone is,

359
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,960
the better they are at hiding that strength.

360
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,780
So you shouldn't rely on this method.

361
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,320
Oh...

362
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,500
Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong.

363
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,200
Yeah.

364
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,580
You won't land a blow on him in six
months through normal means.

365
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,790
Gon, do you have any money?

366
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,850
Actually, I'm running out.

367
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,510
I don't have much, either.

368
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,470
But there's somewhere we can train and
earn money at the same time.

369
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,350
Train and earn money?

370
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,100
The Heavens Arena.

371
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,560
Heavens Arena...

372
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,060
Yeah, I'll explain later.

373
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,780
We should get moving.

374
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,050
Okay!

375
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,730
After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio,

376
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,430
with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,

377
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,500
Gon and Killua now head to a new stage,
the Heavens Arena.

378
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,830
Next time: Then x And x After!

379
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,820
I like sweet and spicy.

380
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,400
I like salty and spicy.

381
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,570
Spicy is good for you!
