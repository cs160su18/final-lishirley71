00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,150
Hey, Youpi!

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,150
I'm over here, fool!

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,310
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,250
That's fine.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,500
That will serve to distract Youpi,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,990
and it will save Shoot.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,050
Duty x And x Question

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,610
"Hagya-sama."

10
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,830
Ikalgo didn't realize that the name
he had spoken with full confidence

11
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,160
had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,

12
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,200
as he headed beneath the palace

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,670
to search for Palm.

14
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,560
Satellite Dragonflies!

15
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,610
Ikalgo knew Palm only through the
information he had been given.

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,670
However, he was already firm in his resolve

17
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,610
that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her.

18
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,870
I'm gonna rescue her.

19
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,120
Palm is a friend of a friend.

20
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,870
That makes her a friend...

21
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,620
My friend!

22
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,060
Palm was risking her life.

23
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,430
That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.

24
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.

25
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to help her...

26
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,650
Because I decided I would help her!

27
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,660
The elevator leading underground

28
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,920
was equipped with a security camera and a scale.

29
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,920
After arriving underground,

30
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,670
it would confirm that there was nothing inside

31
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,710
before automatically returning to the surface.

32
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,320
Any number of people could descend at once,

33
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,180
but only one could ascend at a time.

34
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,060
And a pass code had to be entered.

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,830
The eight-digit code varied per person,
and could be used to identify

36
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,190
who had used the elevator.

37
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,680
If the user's height and weight
do not match the data

38
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,390
on record from the time the code
was assigned, a warning sounded,

39
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,150
and the elevator became a prison.

40
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,200
On the first entry of an incorrect code,
a warning sounded, and the doors locked.

41
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,060
Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,

42
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,690
the elevator filled with sleeping gas,
and the violator was captured and tortured.

43
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,700
In other words, a third error meant death.

44
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,710
Both the violator and the code's
original owner would be killed,

45
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,000
making one's code as valuable as one's own life.

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,170
And the only code holders

47
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,630
able to use the elevator without
any such restriction

48
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,870
were Bizeff and Marcos.

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,290
That was because the elevator
was a more convenient means

50
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,530
of smuggling in various things, including humans,

51
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,880
than the cargo entrance,
which was watched by soldiers.

52
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
What is this smell?!

53
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,280
Has Flutter been living in the morgue?

54
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,670
I can also smell Bro, since he was

55
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,050
the last one in here before me.

56
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,290
Damn, there's something else, very faint...

57
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,360
The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served

58
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,580
to dull Welfin's sense of smell.

59
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,180
Since Bro followed Flutter underground,

60
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,080
he must have also noticed that Flutter
used the name "Hagya-sama."

61
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,490
Or is Brovada conspiring with him?

62
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,760
When I was watching the intruder,

63
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,000
was Bro watching me from behind?

64
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,930
If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,

65
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,380
then he must have seen that
I noticed Flutter's odd behavior...

66
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,360
So, he went down first...

67
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,030
In order to ambush me!

68
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,390
Damn, this is my chance!

69
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,760
Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.

70
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,310
If I can pass him off him as the
bomb threat's perpetrator,

71
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,250
Bizeff will be indebted to me!

72
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,250
Bizeff!

73
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,100
Where's Bizeff?

74
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,670
This is bad...

75
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,860
If he dies during the attack,
my plans will be ruined!

76
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,870
Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!

77
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,560
Yo.

78
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,710
Grandpa...

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,770
He's changed.

80
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,960
My job here is done.

81
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,290
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.

82
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,930
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.

83
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,280
Inside?

84
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,420
Swallowing the words he wanted to say,

85
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,680
Zeno disappeared into the darkness.

86
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,000
Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,

87
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,890
Knuckle has revealed himself, a move
that was not part of the original plan.

88
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,510
Meleoron and Shoot

89
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,370
could only hold their breaths.

90
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,230
Bring it!

91
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,620
Bring it!

92
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,130
I see... Then this is yours.

93
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,780
It's time.

94
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,930
Adding interest.

95
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,500
The number increased?

96
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,650
My attacks won't work?

97
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,790
What is this thing?

98
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,340
Don't you run!

99
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,550
Answer me!

100
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,530
What is this thing?!

101
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,610
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!

102
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,580
If you wanna know, catch me first!

103
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,580
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...

104
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,960
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!

105
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,790
In that case, I'll walk at a pace
that's neither fast nor slow,

106
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,100
to conserve as much oxygen as possible!

107
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,610
I must not lose consciousness...

108
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,010
If I pass out,

109
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,010
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...

110
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,970
Every little bit of damage counts...

111
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,910
I can still fight...

112
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,520
I can still...

113
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,410
I can't... I just can't say it!

114
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,820
I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!

115
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,330
Right now, my job...

116
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,300
isn't to help Shoot!

117
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,120
It's to use my power to help the others,

118
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,090
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!

119
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,980
You have to survive, Shoot!

120
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't die!

121
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,550
No one's here.

122
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,520
Stay calm...

123
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,720
Look around carefully.

124
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,640
If I'm caught, I can still pretend
to be on their side.

125
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,200
However...

126
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,860
That might not work, depending on who I run into.

127
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,220
Perfect Plan... Undo!

128
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,410
Okay!

129
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,830
Activate!

130
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,960
That's Morel's Smoky Jail.

131
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,270
Which means...

132
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,300
Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne
room, with no possibility of interruption!

133
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,280
That only leaves...

134
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,850
Gon and Killua!

135
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,780
Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?

136
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,030
Which way did they go?

137
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,180
Welfin?!

138
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,330
Crap!

139
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,660
He's tough to deal with...

140
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,620
He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!

141
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,590
Once he suspects you, he won't
trust you again until you're dead!

142
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,020
I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?

143
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,020
Which way do I go?

144
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,890
What if he goes the same way?

145
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,570
Do I wait for him to leave?

146
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,420
Can I hold my breath that much longer?

147
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,080
No... I can't hold it!

148
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm at my limit!

149
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,170
I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!

150
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,960
Perfect Plan, undo!

151
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,580
Now inhale...

152
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,960
Activate!

153
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,790
For a second, I sensed something.

154
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,460
The enemy?

155
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,850
Welfin's power reflected his very nature,

156
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,300
channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon.

157
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,520
Egg Man
Missile Man

158
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,900
Missile Man!

159
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,960
If anyone's hiding behind the building,

160
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,790
surrender and show yourself by
the time I count down from three!

161
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,560
If you don't, I'll attack!

162
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,590
Three!

163
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,070
Two!

164
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,530
One!

165
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,340
Fire!

166
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,110
No one's there... Did I imagine it?

167
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,150
To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target

168
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,160
and loads ammo in the form
of questions or commands.

169
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,830
If someone answers falsely or disobeys,
the attack is launched.

170
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,840
By the time Welfin noticed a presence,
Meleoron had already moved.

171
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,640
Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,

172
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,900
his attack would have succeeded,
despite his inability to detect his target.

173
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,200
Finding nothing fitting the target's
description, the attack failed.

174
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,360
Once fired, Missile Man will
pursue its target until it hits.

175
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,500
No one can survive the impact.

176
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,160
However, Welfin understood that
his ability wasn't omnipotent.

177
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,640
His power was nothing more than a tool.

178
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,990
Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.

179
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,800
He sought to become the king behind the scenes,

180
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,180
because being the real king would mean
he'd have too much to be suspicious of.

181
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,560
It was my imagination?

182
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,560
No, wait...

183
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,780
I smell odorless deodorant...

184
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,200
You can't fool my nose.

185
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,310
Someone was here! I know it!

186
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,830
Since I could only sense them for a moment,
they must be very skilled.

187
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,730
The use of deodorant confirms
that they're aware of my nose.

188
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,470
This confirms that there are traitors among us!

189
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,900
There are others besides Flutter?

190
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,100
The answer is probably yes!

191
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,970
And it's someone I know...

192
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,890
That's why they're hiding their scent.

193
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,400
Who is it?

194
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,160
They don't want to fight me?

195
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,740
Because they can take me out at any time?

196
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,570
Do I...

197
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,570
Do I...

198
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,280
Do I really

199
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,020
want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?

200
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,660
Should I really be

201
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,620
searching for Bizeff now?

202
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,490
As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives...

203
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,530
Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou,

204
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,010
their target for avenging Kite.

205
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,230
Next time: Revenge x And x Recovery.

206
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,120
Meleoron!

207
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,810
Ikalgo.

208
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,630
Knuckle!

209
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,340
Shoot.

210
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,180
Morel-san!

211
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,850
Knov.

212
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,640
Palm!

213
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,160
Gon.

214
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,890
Killua...

215
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,960
No matter what happens, always have faith.
