00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,550
Hello? Pitou-sama?

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,440
This is Komugi.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,970
I'm fine, so don't worry.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,810
Got it...

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,790
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,550
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,290
Gon...

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,340
You listened to my request.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,850
So I will be honest with you.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,440
He is

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,020
already

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,690
dead.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,310
His soul is no longer here.

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,340
There is no way to heal him.

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,780
I am sorry.

17
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,380
Huh?

18
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,450
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,820
Turn Kite back to normal.

20
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,010
Please...

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,110
After you finish what you're doing...

22
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,970
Anger x And x Light

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
The tables have been turned.

24
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,740
Pitou believes we have recovered Komugi.

25
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,740
The way things are looking,
that Gon boy will be killed.

26
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,990
I am the only one who can stop Pitou.

27
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,250
If you hand the woman over
to me, I will stop Pitou...

28
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,100
Get lost, scumbag!

29
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,770
Leave her to me.

30
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,280
I swear upon these eyes that
I will not let them have her.

31
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,530
Yeah, I'm counting on you.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,530
Speed of Lightning!

33
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Gon...

34
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,340
Wait for me to get there!

35
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,860
Gon...

36
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,350
I'm sorry to say this,

37
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,360
but I must kill you.

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
For the King.

39
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,140
You must

40
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,180
kill me?

41
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,200
You aren't going to heal him?

42
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,210
Then you really aren't

43
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,000
going to heal Kite...

44
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,580
Liar.

45
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,650
What?

46
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,660
What is this?

47
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,830
I don't care

48
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,970
if this is the end...

49
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,860
So...

50
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll use everything.

51
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,290
I was right.

52
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,970
His power is now equal

53
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,740
to that of the King!

54
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,090
I'll kill you,

55
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,460
Pitou!

56
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,510
Terpsichora!

57
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000
Exceed your limits,

58
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,270
and dance!

59
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,540
I must stop him here!

60
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,800
It can't be!

61
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,550
Is he heading for the King?

62
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,210
Come.

63
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,570
I don't want to destroy this place.

64
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,320
This way.

65
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,280
Follow me.

66
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,570
I don't know how he did it,

67
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,520
but he's forced his body to mature to a point

68
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,350
at which he's able to defeat me.

69
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,260
First comes

70
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,280
rock...

71
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,560
Rock.

72
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,820
Paper.

73
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,820
Rock.

74
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,950
Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,

75
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,260
Pitou felt a sense of relief.

76
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,400
Thank goodness...

77
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,290
This power could only be achieved through
the sacrifice of his own life energy.

78
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,800
He's prepared to never use Nen again.

79
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,620
That was the resolve required
to perform this feat.

80
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,830
An enemy blessed with immense talent

81
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,550
has been forced to exchange all
of that talent for this power.

82
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,080
I'm so glad

83
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,400
I am the one

84
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,540
that he will kill...

85
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,640
Having used Speed of Lightning to race
to Gon, Killua arrived to hear...

86
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,940
Which one of them is doing that?

87
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,190
Gon!

88
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,790
And what he found was...

89
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,840
A silhouette that looked nothing
like the person he'd known,

90
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,960
swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches,

91
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,780
downward toward the skull
of an already-broken Pitou...

92
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,790
Rock.

93
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,720
Paper.

94
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,020
...for the final, shattering blow.

95
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,980
Kite...

96
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,360
I finished the job, the way you taught me to.

97
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,030
So...

98
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,270
Gon,

99
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,390
is that you?

100
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,030
Killua...

101
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,780
Having seen Gon's appearance,
Killua immediately thought of Bisky.

102
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,040
But he realized the difference at once.

103
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,310
Bisky's appearance changed,

104
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,850
but there wasn't a massive increase
in the aura contained within her.

105
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,050
And in Bisky's case,

106
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,430
she was merely reverting to her original form.

107
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,180
But Gon's done the opposite!

108
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,570
How many years?

109
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,400
More than ten?

110
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,270
Decades?

111
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,860
This would have been the result
of years of endless training.

112
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,450
What price did he have to pay
to obtain so much aura?

113
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,050
Pitou's devotion to the King was so great

114
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,280
that even after death, Terpsichora clad
itself in even more powerful Nen,

115
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,460
transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet
ready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey,

116
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,550
its sole purpose to kill Gon.

117
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,560
In that fraction of a second,
shorter than the blink of an eye,

118
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,920
Killua heard Gon speak.

119
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,060
It's okay.

120
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,230
It doesn't hurt.

121
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,020
I'm not trying to be tough.

122
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,290
I'm kind of happy...

123
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,320
I finally

124
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,630
get to be the same

125
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,350
as Kite was then.

126
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,040
Gon...

127
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,660
I feel like

128
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,940
I've been redeemed some.

129
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,680
You can have my right arm.

130
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,610
First comes rock...

131
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,370
Gon!

132
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,600
It's time for you

133
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,870
to sleep, too.

134
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,740
Stop...

135
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,940
You can't!

136
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,380
If you keep using this power,

137
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,380
what will happen to you?

138
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,880
Rock.

139
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,580
Paper.

140
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,590
Gon!

141
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,550
Next time: Flash x And x Start.

142
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,430
I never got a chance to say this, but thank you...

143
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,600
For everything.
