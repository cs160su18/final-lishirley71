2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,190
All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,860
I'm not looking for any trouble.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,730
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,540
to change the result?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,750
If I can get my target to move as I want,

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,540
I've succeeded as a Hunter.

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,000
Request x And x Wish

9
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,000
On August 8th at 12:00 AM,

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,710
in the Hunter Association main headquarters,

11
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,760
the voting to elect Netero's successor,

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,700
the 13th Chairman, began.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,510
Heart Is Valuable

14
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,520
The rules set by Ging

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,890
made all of the six hundred and sixty-one members

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,260
both a candidate and voter.

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,470
On this day,

18
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,360
voter turnout was below the required 95%,

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,150
meaning the vote had to be redone.

20
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,150
1) Pariston
2) Cheadle
3) Ickshonpe
4) Botobai

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,230
However, the second vote

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,170
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 251 (37.9%)
2) Cheadle — 46
3) Ickshonpe — 28
4) Botobai — 27
5) Mizaistom — 24

23
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,160
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora — 10
12) Loupe — 9
13) Linne, Biscuit — 8
15) Tsezguerra — 7
16) Knov, Kanzai — 6
18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, Geru, 13 others — 3
35) Saiyu, 11 others — 2
47) Gon, Hanzo, 16 others — 1

24
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,660
also failed to meet the requirements,

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,660
Vote must be retaken because
requirements were not met.

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,660
Invalid — 45                    Absent — 33
Turnout — 88.2%

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,670
and had to be redone again.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,420
Taking the results from the
two votes into consideration...

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,790
First, we will have Beans-san review all ballots

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,180
before they are entered, to reduce
the number of invalid votes.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,430
Second,

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,940
Hunters who violate the rules by
abstaining or submitting invalid votes

33
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,280
will have their licenses temporarily taken away.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,690
Those are my two suggestions.

35
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,310
If we implement the first,
do we still need the second?

36
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,200
Just getting rid of the invalid
votes would put us over 95%.

37
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,760
I wouldn't be so sure...

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,750
Some Hunters may play hooky when they
learn they can't submit invalid votes.

39
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,190
There are those who would trample
on the former chairman's wishes.

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,060
What?

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,450
Drop it. You'll only waste time.

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh? Did I say something wrong?

43
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,550
The former chairman declared that
a 95% turnout was required,

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,600
so Hunters who submit invalid votes or
won't vote are betraying his memory.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,350
They just don't want to see you become chairman!

46
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,020
Then they should vote for someone else.

47
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,510
I'm sure there are other qualified candidates.

48
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,110
Though that isn't how the majority of Hunters feel...

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,490
Is that too hard for you, with your limited
vocabulary and math skills?

50
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,120
I told you that you'd only waste time.

51
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,630
You get a warning, Kanzai.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,020
Before adding new rules,
I believe we should broadcast

53
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,880
each candidate's message.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,050
Besides, abstaining and submitting invalid
votes are not technically violations.

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,030
I fully agree with your first statement,

56
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,140
but the second makes me
wonder if I heard right...

57
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,340
I cannot believe those words came from one

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,150
of the former chairman's leading supporters.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,050
The former chairman said

60
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,560
that the difficulty of this election was D-rank.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,780
Which means, for us Hunters with stars,
this should be a simple task.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,290
In other words, the former chairman
trusted us to handle this.

63
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,740
Pariston, you're a pain!

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,290
Don't talk! Keep your mouth shut!

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,310
The difficulty level is just his way of
expressing his degree of trust in the Zodiacs.

66
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,940
If it's S, he's encouraging us.

67
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,510
If it's F, he's challenging us.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,760
You can spin it however you want,

69
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,930
but abstaining and submitting invalid
votes don't violate any rules, scumbag.

70
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,210
When I called them violations...

71
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,710
I was only insinuating that those
Hunters are mistaken in their manner

72
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,060
of paying respects to the former chairman.

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,990
The message is that making the election
a success would be the right way

74
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,810
to pay our respects to him.

75
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,890
Then, say that during your speech!

76
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,070
If you make it a rule, that's coercion!

77
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,510
Is coercion such a bad thing?

78
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,710
Okay, I get the idea...

79
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,940
That's enough.

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,330
I'm fine with both suggestions.

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,410
My reasons are different than yours,

82
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,480
but I agree that, barring
extraordinary circumstances,

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,190
no Hunters should be abstaining
or submitting invalid votes.

84
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,640
Then let's take a vote.

85
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,850
First things first.

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,240
I hope you aren't going to say that,
during that time, Hunters who

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,590
have their licenses taken away
aren't considered pro Hunters.

88
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,230
You aren't that stupid, are you?

89
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,730
Of course not...

90
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,140
I wouldn't think of using such underhanded
logic to manipulate the vote.

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,490
Their licenses will be confiscated. Nothing more.

92
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,850
What if they're lost?

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,640
A Hunter who has lost his license

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,240
may be protected by the rules,

95
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,380
but is not qualified to be a pro
as far as we're concerned, yes?

96
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,130
Uh...

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,580
Are you saying that someone

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,450
would use the threat of a license going
missing to manipulate the vote?

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,890
We can't guarantee no one will do that.

100
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,140
Let this be clearly recorded in the minutes...

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,900
Hunters who lose their licenses during the election

102
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,530
will not lose their right to vote.

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,060
That way, no one can manipulate
the turnout or the majority.

104
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,950
I hate to admit it,

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,540
but unless we do something about
the majority, not just the turnout,

106
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,290
Pariston will keep smiling.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,820
6) Saccho
7) Ginta
8) Morel
9) Piyon, Cluck
11) Cutie, Sanbica

108
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,620
He already seems to have secured the votes

109
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,120
that went to Ginta, Piyon, and Cluck.

110
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,710
6) Saccho
7) Morel
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora
12) Loupe

111
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,030
If our timing is wrong, there will be casualties.

112
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,830
I hate to admit it...

113
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,270
But some part of me

114
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,580
wishes that Ging were here.

115
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,250
A beast that cannot be tamed...

116
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,660
Why did the Chairman select
him as Vice Chairman?

117
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,210
Since I get to choose my second-in-command,

118
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,350
choosing a yes-man wouldn't be any fun.

119
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,100
It should be someone I can't stand...

120
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,450
That is who I want at my side.

121
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,360
Chairman,

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,600
I still believe you made a mistake.

123
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,910
Young Killua has returned?

124
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,050
That's great...

125
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,900
When I saw his name on the list of Hunters
who didn't vote, I was worried.

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,240
How's he doing?

127
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,460
He's opened Testing Gates 1 through 5?

128
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,400
Actually, his expression was what concerned me.

129
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,010
He looked very distressed...

130
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,360
I couldn't bring myself to speak to him.

131
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,410
If you run into his friend there,
can you relay a message?

132
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,400
Ask him to help young Killua.

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,040
Well...

134
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,170
His friend is why he's upset.

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,820
What? Gon-kun?

136
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,930
Young Killua...

137
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,920
Let me see Alluka.

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,800
I need her power.

139
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
Killua...

140
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,930
I don't have time, Dad!

141
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,130
I'll go even if you try to stop me, so come with me.

142
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,740
It's useless.

143
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,430
No one can control Alluka.

144
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,420
That's wrong!

145
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,060
You're wrong... Brother's wrong...

146
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,900
Alluka's a member of the family!

147
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,070
She isn't a machine!

148
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,810
As her brother, I'm asking her for help!

149
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,420
For help?

150
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,830
That child

151
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,080
is not human.

152
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,960
You shouldn't consider

153
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
that thing to be a member of the family.

154
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,710
What did you say?

155
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,240
That thing

156
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,170
is something that came

157
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,050
from somewhere else.

158
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,890
Sit.

159
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,540
If someone tries to dispel the restriction
and covenant Gon set for himself,

160
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,400
they'll be either repelled or killed.

161
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,690
If Alluka hasn't changed,

162
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm the only one who can help her.

163
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,660
And Alluka's the only one who can save Gon.

164
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,290
Promise me one thing.

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,590
Never betray your friends.

166
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,180
If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help,
wouldn't I be betraying him?

167
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,180
Come with me.

168
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm sure you already know this,

169
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,390
but no new requests have been made.

170
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,470
Who made the last wish?

171
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,390
Milluki.

172
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,820
He asked for the newest computer
available at the time.

173
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,420
He made the wish himself in Alluka's
presence, so he couldn't lie.

174
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,100
A computer shouldn't be that bad...

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,090
Was it because Illumi was controlling me?

176
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,670
How could I leave my little
sister in this situation?

177
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,550
Killua, I want to go over this again.

178
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,840
When making a wish to Alluka,
what are the rules?

179
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,500
It's not necessary...

180
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,760
I know Alluka better than anyone.

181
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
It's necessary.

182
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,590
Have you forgotten how many people have died?

183
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,290
We've killed more people!

184
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,190
Killua,

185
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,400
if you can't stay calm, we're stopping now.

186
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:13,950
Our promise matters to me because
I care about you, as your father.

187
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,210
Can you go over the rules for me?

188
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,650
Alluka is...

189
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,840
Mitsuba... Mitsuba!

190
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,100
Carry me.

191
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,330
Yes, yes... I will!

192
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,110
There!

193
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,960
Climb the stairs!

194
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,190
Yes, yes.

195
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,110
Raise me up high!

196
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,860
Yes, yes.

197
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,100
There you go!

198
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,280
Mitsuba...

199
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,620
Yes, yes? What is it, Master Alluka?

200
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,260
Yes... Master Alluka's
face suddenly changed!

201
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah, it's okay. I can handle this.

202
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,460
Alluka, lift me up high!

203
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,890
'Kay.

204
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,890
Up high...

205
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,900
Up high...

206
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,570
'Kay.

207
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,900
See? She's back.

208
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,230
Keep this a secret from everyone.

209
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, I already told your mother...

210
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,160
What?

211
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,460
But it was our secret!

212
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,790
It happens after three requests are fulfilled...

213
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,290
Yep, her eyes turn black.

214
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,750
And they turn back after Alluka lifts you up high?

215
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,430
No, then Alluka grants a wish.

216
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,690
I didn't understand at first...

217
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,050
So I wished for her to tell me
how to turn her eyes back,

218
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,940
and Alluka told me.

219
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,690
Do you remember the exact words Alluka said?

220
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,200
After she grants a wish, her eyes turn white.

221
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,700
And when three of her requests
are fulfilled, they turn black.

222
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,960
Refuse any requests that Alluka makes.

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,690
No matter how small they are.

224
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,980
Yes, I understand.

225
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,010
Mitsuba... Carry me!

226
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,630
I can't do that, Master.

227
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,210
Then, Mitsuba, shake my hand.

228
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh, um...

229
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,640
I can't do that, Master.

230
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,770
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,740
Then I want a piggyback ride, Mitsuba.

232
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,470
I'm sorry... I can't.

233
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,950
What should I do?

234
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,300
Come on, Master!

235
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,640
Let's go catch some bugs.

236
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,500
Okay?

237
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,010
Then, Mitsuba, lift me up high.

238
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,160
I can't do that, either, Mast—

239
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,470
Mitsuba was in the play area...

240
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,900
Hasamu was in the butlers' quarters.

241
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,420
So two people, in different locations,

242
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,410
were instantly crushed at the same time...

243
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,420
What is happening?

244
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,410
It's because she refused.

245
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,920
She refused four of Alluka's requests.

246
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,300
Yasuha, piggyback ride!

247
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,430
Yes, Master.

248
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,990
Master Alluka...

249
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,000
Can you make me

250
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,220
a millionaire?

251
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,520
'Kay.

252
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,770
'Kay.

253
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,550
There has been a mysterious incident
in which an airship transporting money

254
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:55,060
suddenly went missing, and when it
was found, all the money was gone.

255
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,760
The pilot and crew members have
provided baffling explanations.

256
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,250
It will take a while to determine the cause.

257
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,290
I'm very sorry!

258
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,050
I couldn't help myself...

259
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,000
I find it hard to believe that
this was just a coincidence.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,970
When Alluka is with us...

261
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,760
He never makes any requests.

262
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,740
Dad, can you let me choose the next butler?

263
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,250
So your mission is to fulfill Alluka's requests.

264
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,270
Yes... I understand.

265
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:40,100
If you clear this mission,
I will spare you and your lover.

266
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,340
Hey, Kasuga...

267
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,540
Yes, what is it?

268
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,040
Give me your liver.

269
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,010
Um, that's not...

270
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,490
You know?

271
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,290
You won't do it?

272
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,300
Then, Kasuga, give me your duodenum.

273
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,190
Please wait, Master...

274
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,850
Let's play a different game! Okay?

275
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,980
You won't do it?

276
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,100
Then, Kasuga, give me your spine.

277
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,940
Master!

278
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,440
Master... Please...

279
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,950
Then, Kasuga...

280
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,660
Give me your brain.

281
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,070
When three of Alluka's requests are
fulfilled, she'll grant one wish.

282
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,240
There probably isn't any limit
to the wishes she can grant.

283
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,720
My guess is that she can grant any wish.

284
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,230
Wish

285
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,230
But the bigger the wish she grants...

286
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,480
Request 1

287
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,900
Request 1                   Request 2

288
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,730
The bigger the next three requests will be.

289
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,610
Request 3                  Request 1           Request 2

290
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,150
In other words, an equivalent exchange.

291
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,870
And the sacrifice isn't made by the
one whose wish was granted.

292
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,210
It's the next person who fulfills the requests.

293
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,370
Request 1                             Request 2

294
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,300
If someone denies four of
Alluka's requests in a row,

295
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,250
that person and their most loved one,

296
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,250
meaning a minimum of two people, will die.

297
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,520
The bigger the wish, the more people
die when the requests aren't fulfilled.

298
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,640
After that wish, sixty-seven people died,
and those are just the ones we knew of.

299
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,760
Thinking of the family that
has been separated...

300
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,900
Thinking of the friend who is dying...

301
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,300
What will Killua do next?

302
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,440
Next time: Alluka x And x Something.
