2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,980
This country allows ordinary tourists.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,170
That's where we'll find Killua?

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,030
By airship, it will take three days to reach...

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,500
When do we leave?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,770
Today! Right now!

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,320
Yeah, no objection from me!

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,780
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.

9
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,170
I'm from a family of assassins.

10
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,110
So they're all assassins.

11
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,460
And the family has

12
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,570
really high hopes for me...

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,840
But I can't stand it.

14
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,890
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?

15
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,590
Killua...

16
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,880
What's with the long face, Gon?

17
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,030
We'll be in the Republic of
Padokea by morning.

18
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
You'll see Killua soon enough.

19
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,030
Yep!

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,040
We'll definitely take Killua back with us!

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,050
A x Dangerous x Watchdog

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,810
Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived

23
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,220
in the Dentora region

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,730
of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives.

25
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,730
There it is.

26
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,990
The base for this family of
assassins is on that mountain?

27
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,990
It sure looks creepy...

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,120
Yes.

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,740
Once we reach our destination,

30
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,390
we should start gathering information.

31
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,120
Okay.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,130
Kukuroo Mountain?

33
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,130
In that case, you should take the
scenic mountain bus tour over there.

34
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,170
The tour only runs once a day,
but you'll have a guide

35
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,130
to show you around.

36
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,740
Okay...

37
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,200
Thank you for taking the
Lamentation Tour today.

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,810
We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain,

39
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,440
home to the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins.

40
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,280
Look.

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,950
They obviously aren't tourists.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes...

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,950
Everyone?

44
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,830
Please look to your right.

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,340
That is Kukuroo Mountain,
where the Zoldyck family lives.

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,570
A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain,

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,170
and the Zoldyck estate is
somewhere on that mountain.

48
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,430
But no one has ever actually seen it.

49
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,280
The Zoldyck family includes ten members:

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,150
a great-grandfather, grandfather,
grandmother, father, mother,

51
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,480
and then, there are five children.

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,250
All of them are assassins!

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,980
Then, let us approach the mountain.

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,000
That's really something.

55
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,500
This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,950
Also known as the Door to Hades

57
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,460
because no one who's entered
has ever returned alive.

58
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,930
To enter, you must pass through the door

59
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,760
beside the security checkpoint.

60
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,530
But the area beyond the gate
is private property,

61
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,010
so we can't proceed.

62
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,880
Hold on!

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,270
This is the front gate?

64
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,580
The mountain's all the way over there!

65
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,730
Correct...

66
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,650
The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain,

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
as well as the surrounding land.

68
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,520
This whole area is their backyard?

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,970
Hey, guide...

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,660
Yes?

71
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,660
What do we have to do to get inside?

72
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,920
Little boy, were you listening
to my explanation?

73
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,070
Uh-huh.

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,160
But...

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,960
If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,300
Assassins live inside.

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,280
It's all a sham.

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,930
Huh?

79
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,210
A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.

80
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,310
Just a photo of their faces is
worth a hundred million.

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,980
Seriously?!

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,660
Damn!

83
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,020
I should have taken a picture of Killua!

84
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,940
It's just another case of rampant rumors

85
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,570
masking a mundane truth.

86
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,700
Open the gate!

87
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,280
I-I cannot do that.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,090
The master would not be pleased.

89
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,250
Don't worry.

90
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,830
We're going to kill your master.

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,450
Ouch...

92
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,830
Are you okay?

93
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,710
Yes, I'm fine.

94
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,110
Man... Now Mike's going to end up
eating between meals again.

95
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,440
Huh?

96
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,480
Please...

97
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,480
He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.

98
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,590
Mike!

99
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,860
Don't blame me if you get fat!

100
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,140
What was that?

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,370
Hey, boys!

102
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,880
What are you doing?

103
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,880
Get on the bus!

104
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,610
You can leave.

105
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,630
We're staying here.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,010
Huh?

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,460
I see.

108
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,150
So you're young Killua's friends.

109
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm happy to hear that.

110
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,540
I've worked here for twenty years,

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,370
but this is the first time

112
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,770
any friends have come to visit.

113
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,000
Since I work here, I shouldn't say this,

114
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,570
but the place is rather lonely.

115
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,000
No one ever visits.

116
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,560
Though we do see a lot of those...

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,080
Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual.

118
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,590
So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.

119
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,670
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

120
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,040
Thank you.

121
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,020
Don't mention it.

122
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,450
However...

123
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,150
I cannot let you inside.

124
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,550
Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?

125
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,260
Its name is Mike.

126
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,020
It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.

127
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,170
It only obeys family,
and will attack anyone else.

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,460
The beast still follows the order

129
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,520
its master gave it ten years ago...

130
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,180
To kill every single intruder.

131
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,120
But technically, he isn't following the order.

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,790
Because he keeps eating them...

133
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,990
Anyway, I can't let you inside.

134
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,690
I wouldn't want to reduce young
Killua's friends to skeletons.

135
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,200
Sir, how is it that you're safe?

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,790
You go inside, correct?

137
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,960
If you never needed to enter,
you wouldn't have a key.

138
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,960
Quite perceptive of you.

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,460
But you're only half right.

140
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,180
I require no key to get inside.

141
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,720
This key is for intruders.

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,720
A key for intruders?

143
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,130
For some reason,

144
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,200
eighty to ninety percent of intruders
attempt to use the front gate.

145
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,870
If I don't open the gate for them,

146
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,520
they'll try to break it down.

147
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,790
Such troublemakers...

148
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,260
So we added a locked door to one side.

149
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,310
The intruders take the key
from the helpless guard,

150
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,000
and then Mike eats them.

151
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,590
A locked door...

152
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,260
That's it!

153
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,850
As you just realized, I'm not a guard.

154
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,760
I merely clean up after Mike.

155
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,770
And the actual gate isn't locked!

156
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,270
Exactly.

157
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,730
What?

158
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:42,120
Hunter Vocabulary

159
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,120
Lamentation Tours

160
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,970
I've tried pushing and pulling,
but it won't budge!

161
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,900
Are you sure it isn't locked?

162
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,440
You just aren't strong enough.

163
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,340
That's absurd!

164
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,070
I've been using all of my strength!

165
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,490
Just watch.

166
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,330
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.

167
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,750
Anyone who cannot open this gate

168
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,380
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.

169
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,390
As you just saw, the door closes automatically,

170
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,110
so you'll want to run in, the second it opens.

171
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,340
You don't need to worry about Mike.

172
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,660
He has orders not to attack any who
enter through the Testing Gate.

173
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,700
Still, this is getting tougher as I age...

174
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,230
But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate,

175
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,420
so I need to keep in shape.

176
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,380
I should mention that each of gate
one's doors weighs two tons.

177
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,770
Two tons?

178
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,380
You're not supposed to be able to open that!

179
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,930
Wait, what did you say?

180
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,050
Gate one?

181
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,940
Yes, have a look.

182
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,760
There are seven gates.

183
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,230
When you go up a gate, the weight doubles.

184
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,940
Doubles?

185
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,700
The number of gates that open depends

186
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,280
on the amount of strength you use.

187
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,210
Incidentally, when young Killua returned,

188
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,210
he opened gates one through three.

189
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,430
Gate three?

190
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,300
That would be twelve tons!

191
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,200
Sixteen tons, Gon.

192
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,560
Do you understand now?

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,570
This is what's required just
to get in the door.

194
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,120
They live in a completely different world.

195
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,730
Hmm, I don't like it.

196
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,980
Mister, lend me the key.

197
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,230
I came here to see my friend,
not to be tested.

198
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,480
You can consider me an intruder.

199
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
So let me borrow the key.

200
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,260
I'll use the intruder's door.

201
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,180
Gon!

202
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,490
Hey...

203
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,080
It doesn't matter if you
won't loan me the key.

204
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,750
I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes.

205
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,750
Don't be stupid, Gon!

206
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,380
Didn't you see that monster?

207
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,080
Its arm was bigger than your entire body!

208
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,630
I won't accept this!

209
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,440
Why would you test your friends?

210
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,430
I'll never enter through that door.

211
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,860
You are absolutely right.

212
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,100
However, forcing your way
through is impossible.

213
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,900
Mike will kill you.

214
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,010
I agree.

215
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,260
We have plenty of time.

216
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,650
Let's figure out a way to
enter through gate one.

217
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,750
It's no use.

218
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,310
He's not gonna change his mind.

219
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,660
Indeed...

220
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,720
Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key.

221
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,420
I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.

222
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,800
Well, please wait here for a minute.

223
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,180
Hello? This is Zebro.

224
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,090
Three of young Killua's

225
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,690
friends are here to see him.

226
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,950
Yes.

227
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,380
Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes.

228
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,180
Yes, I understand. Yes.

229
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.

230
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,380
Yep, I got in trouble.

231
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,370
You called the mansion?

232
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,080
No, I was speaking with the
Zoldyck family butler.

233
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,030
All communication with the mansion
must go through the butler.

234
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,880
It's very difficult to reach any
of the family members.

235
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,230
Could you call him again?

236
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,970
I'll talk to him this time.

237
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,240
Sure, I guess...

238
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,980
But you won't enjoy the experience.

239
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,730
Yes, this is the butler's office.

240
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,310
I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends.

241
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,640
Is Killua-kun there?

242
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,240
Killua-sama has no friends.

243
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,740
Yes, this is the butler's office.

244
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,650
How could you possibly know that?!

245
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,310
Put Killua on the phone!

246
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,190
I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?

247
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,810
Yeah.

248
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,480
Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens
to have a friend named Gon.

249
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,150
There is no proof that you are Gon.

250
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,500
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!

251
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,890
By your voice?

252
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,570
That isn't a reliable test.

253
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,200
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!

254
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,530
That was a simple recording.

255
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,580
And there are many other ways
to mimic a person's voice.

256
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,960
Next, you'll claim that he'd
recognize you by sight.

257
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,660
There are only a few methods

258
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,890
by which you could perfectly mimic
someone's appearance.

259
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,110
But it still isn't impossible.

260
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,620
Additionally, it's possible that someone
forced you to approach Killua-sama

261
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,350
for sinister purposes.

262
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,850
As long as the threat exists,

263
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,860
I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.

264
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,910
The Zoldyck family practices the
trade of assassination.

265
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,680
Naturally, it has made enemies.

266
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,300
As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters

267
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,090
from their enemies.

268
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,920
I apologize, but please leave.

269
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Hey! Gon!

270
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Gon!

271
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,680
He's really pissed now.

272
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,780
He's going to climb over the wall...

273
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,690
What?

274
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,560
Hey! Stop it, Gon!

275
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,790
It's okay. You two can wait here.

276
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,140
I'll go by myself.

277
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,700
I can't let you do that!

278
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,720
I'll be fine!

279
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,700
No, you won't!

280
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,060
Both of you should calm down!

281
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm perfectly calm!

282
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,270
Come down here, Gon!

283
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,330
Don't be stupid.

284
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,010
Gon-kun, I'll give you the key.

285
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,370
You can go through the door.

286
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,960
Hold on, pops!

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,170
We can convince Gon to stop!

288
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,300
Really?

289
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,840
But he appears to be a stubborn boy.

290
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,490
To make amends,

291
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,850
I'll accompany you through the door.

292
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,600
Huh?

293
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
It's possible that Mike

294
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,370
may recognize me and decide not to attack.

295
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,610
Though I'm almost a hundred percent
certain that he'll kill us all.

296
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,270
You can't do that.

297
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,110
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

298
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,300
No, I'm coming with you.

299
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,370
The result will be the same if I stay behind.

300
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,940
If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,

301
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,000
I'd never be able to face him again.

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,880
If you die,

303
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,380
I will also die.

304
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,970
I understand now.

305
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,530
I didn't stop to consider your situation.

306
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,890
Sorry.

307
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,880
He's a good boy.

308
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,990
He's willing to quell his own anger
for another person's sake.

309
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,860
He believes in his own strength,

310
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,510
as well as in his friends.

311
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,410
He has a strong heart.

312
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,410
It's likely that Mike
won't frighten him at all.

313
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,560
You must like animals, Gon-kun.

314
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,790
Yeah.

315
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,340
Just as I thought.

316
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,720
Did you grow up playing in the countryside?

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,800
Yep! How did you know?

318
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,310
Gon-kun, I'm going to open
the Testing Gate again.

319
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,110
I want you to see Mike for yourself.

320
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Hey...

321
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,190
Is it really okay for us to come in?

322
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,790
Yes, you'll be safe because you
entered through the Testing Gate.

323
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,260
Mike! Come here!

324
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,060
Gon-kun, do you understand now?

325
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,880
This is a trained hunting dog.

326
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,170
It's nothing like the wild animals
you're accustomed to.

327
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,150
You must have expected to be able
to communicate with him.

328
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,140
Until you saw his eyes.

329
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,640
Mike is currently

330
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,400
memorizing the appearances and
scents of humans he's never seen.

331
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,410
There's nothing else on his mind.

332
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,530
He's like a machine.

333
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,770
Gon-kun, could you fight him?

334
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,530
No, I'm scared.

335
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,540
I don't want to fight him!

336
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,540
He's such an honest boy.

337
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,420
Well, how long will you be here?

338
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,210
Until we meet Killua!

339
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,950
We won't leave before then!

340
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,040
Then please come this way.

341
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,600
The Testing Gate...

342
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,810
And Mike...

343
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,880
Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family

344
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,610
lives in a completely different world.

345
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,120
However, Gon had promised himself...

346
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,880
No matter what difficulties awaited him,

347
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,900
he would find Killua in the end.

348
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,460
Next time: The x Guard's x Duty!

349
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,840
5 x 5 = 25.

350
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,220
So you know how to do math.

351
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,760
5 x 5 = 25!
