2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,730
Don't come any closer...

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,990
Pouf!

4
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,990
Defeat x And x Dignity

5
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,250
Why?

6
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,730
Had you remained silent,
I could have killed him.

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,810
Why are you so needlessly frightened?

8
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,060
He noticed you.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,

10
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,380
he would have immediately attacked Komugi.

11
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,900
That was a risk I didn't want to take.

12
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,340
Your words baffle me.

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,900
Isn't he sitting there because
he wants to help that girl?

14
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,490
You almost make it sound like
he means to harm her.

15
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,530
Why?

16
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,020
It's none of your business.

17
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,420
Shut up.

18
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,430
Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon.

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,430
You go find Knuckle.

20
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,990
Pouf is outside the barrier,

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,470
so it's very likely the big guy was taken out.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,180
Review the situation,

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,450
then you and Knuckle decide what
to do, and whether to retreat.

24
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,470
Wh-What about you guys?

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,850
Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge.

26
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,200
At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's.

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm kidding!

28
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,770
It'll be fine.

29
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,830
I've always got the magic word, "Kite"!

30
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,630
I have it under control.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,460
Really?

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,620
Then why did you

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,660
look so sad back there?

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,910
You're sure, then?

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,320
You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway.

36
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,400
Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!

37
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,400
It's none of your business.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,350
Shut up.

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,160
Shut up?

40
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,930
Downwind, huh?

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,360
Am I interrupting something?

42
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,730
Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then.

43
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,400
Don't move.

44
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,620
Stay right there.

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,160
You can use your wing scales to control others, right?

46
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,700
Don't take a single step.

47
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,430
Pouf, please!

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,590
Are you insane?

49
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,280
You want me to stand here and do nothing?

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
For that woman's sake?

51
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,280
For the King's sake!

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,220
Do as he says...

53
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,100
What happened?

54
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,750
Your expression has changed...

55
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,180
What happened while I was trapped?

56
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,260
I promise that I shall not move from this spot.

57
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,630
In return, I want you to tell me

58
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,630
everything that has happened thus far.

59
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,640
If I ask where the King is, he'll
get suspicious and silence us.

60
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,240
Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,330
Be careful to make it sound quite natural.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,400
If you fail, we will see bloodshed.

63
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,090
That's all there is to it.

64
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,780
It's time.

65
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,120
Adding interest.

66
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,580
I've got it...

67
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,820
I could feel myself controlling the explosion.

68
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,810
If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered.

69
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
I need rage...

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,070
I must build up my rage before
I forget how it felt!

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,710
That's the second time you've
made a fool out of me!

72
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,330
Scum! Trash!

73
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,720
Piece of crap!

74
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,010
Stay calm, and let rage consume me...

75
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,340
Create and destroy at the same time.

76
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,350
Manifested through this body!

77
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,680
Youpi had yet to notice

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,850
why two conflicting emotions
could exist simultaneously...

79
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,530
Or what his current predicament was.

80
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,930
Rage...

81
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,120
Rage is not intended to be scattered.

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,370
It's meant to be focused on a target!

83
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,250
I Will Destroy You!!!

84
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,610
I will destroy you!

85
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,270
Okay! Okay!

86
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,310
It's a fake, okay!

87
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,380
Keep it up...

88
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,680
Make me madder!

89
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,310
Come on!

90
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,030
It's time.

91
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,360
Adding interest.

92
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,080
APR's interest is calculated

93
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,710
assuming that aura consumption will
continue to rise at the current rate.

94
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,560
Even if Youpi were to reduce his
aura usage to a bare minimum,

95
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,140
in another three minutes and fifty seconds,

96
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,180
he would reach the point at which
he would be unable to use Nen.

97
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,190
Ten left.

98
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,360
My back's against the wall...

99
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,050
Looks like he's saving me for last.

100
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,580
In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!

101
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,130
Morel had deployed all of his puppets
close enough for Youpi to see

102
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,710
so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,

103
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:04,770
but also because he no longer had the
strength to move his puppets around.

104
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,270
If he lost his focus, the puppets would
return to smoke and dissipate.

105
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,070
It shouldn't be much longer...

106
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,660
He has to run out of Nen at some point.

107
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,310
But...

108
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,830
But damn...

109
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,940
My body and soul...

110
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,250
refuse to move.

111
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,690
At this point, Morel could not
even will himself to stand.

112
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,250
He had literally reached his limit
even before Youpi went bankrupt.

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,060
Zero left...

114
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,450
I have something to say to you.

115
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,370
Now that Youpi had learned

116
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,290
how to store his rage elsewhere,
his head was much clearer.

117
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,830
You look like a little fly that's about to die.

118
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,800
And yet...

119
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,050
That's what makes you guys amazing.

120
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,400
During the battle, Youpi had
evolved at an alarming rate,

121
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,300
increasing the gap between
the Hunters and himself.

122
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,530
Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.

123
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,580
Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,

124
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,500
this must have been the last thing he
expected Youpi to say in this situation.

125
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:49,140
But Morel could honestly accept
that this was Youpi's true nature.

126
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm not sure how to say this...

127
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,580
But because you've impressed me,

128
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,030
I have to be sure to kill you.

129
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,220
It's only proper, I guess?

130
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,570
This is game over.

131
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,660
Well, I'll end this with one blow.

132
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,730
Don't move.

133
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,230
I don't think I even mind letting him

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,990
kill me now.

135
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,990
Bye.

136
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,870
He disappeared?

137
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,260
There's blood...

138
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,270
What's going on?

139
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,020
It wasn't teleportation?

140
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,150
The moment I was about to cut through him,

141
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,650
he disappeared.

142
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,760
I thought that one of them had the
ability to use teleportation...

143
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,890
But when he disappeared,
I didn't see anyone else.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,920
And I struck before he disappeared, so if
he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood.

145
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,550
But I was able to cut him.

146
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,220
Yet I can no longer see him.

147
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,550
Does that mean he only turned invisible?

148
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,420
An ability to become transparent?

149
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,680
If he had that ability,
he would have used it sooner.

150
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,920
Which means one of the others

151
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,940
must be able to make himself
and the rest invisible.

152
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,400
And right before I connected, he tried
to save the guy with the sunglasses.

153
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,450
But I left a deep wound.

154
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,650
Here he comes!

155
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,760
The blood...

156
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,350
Youpi can follow the blood!

157
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,220
We may be invisible, but the
blood is leaving a trail.

158
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,690
If he swings that blade again,
I'll have to get away by myself.

159
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,140
I'm running out of breath...

160
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,480
Damn it!

161
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,270
Knuckle?!

162
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,120
Why did you reveal yourself?

163
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,290
Right now, your job is to stay
hidden as long as possible!

164
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,340
I'm done running and hiding.

165
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll face you.

166
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,640
So...

167
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,150
Let them escape.

168
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,650
Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists

169
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,290
because Youpi's words had
struck a chord with him.

170
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,160
You're crazy.

171
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,140
You can't even call that a trade-off.

172
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,980
My answer

173
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,420
is no.

174
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,180
However...

175
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,680
If you get rid of this thing,
my answer might change.

176
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm sure this has to do with why you've
been constantly on the run.

177
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,440
Removing it will make the
exchange more even.

178
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,450
No... Don't do it!

179
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,450
Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!

180
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,460
Morel's desperate cry did not reach
Knuckle due to God's Accomplice.

181
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,970
However, it did return Meleoron to his senses.

182
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,100
Leave me here...

183
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,110
You can't!

184
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,860
You can't do that, Knuckle!

185
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,110
Don't worry about me...

186
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,370
Will you waste everything we've done?

187
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,450
Everything that Morel, and Shoot...

188
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,870
and you...

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
have done by risking your lives!

190
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,780
If Knuckle didn't act, the two of
them could still fight together.

191
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,010
To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden.

192
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,460
With that in mind, the decision that
Meleoron made after leaving Morel...

193
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,270
Knuckle!

194
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,020
Knuckle!

195
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,030
...ended up backfiring.

196
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,660
Impossible...

197
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,190
We no longer have a way...

198
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,290
to defeat Youpi...

199
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,290
Why...

200
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:32,330
The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded
Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him.

201
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,870
Okay... I took away APR!

202
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,760
Now the terms are even.

203
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,060
Leave the boss alone!

204
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,090
Fight me!

205
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,320
Kill me!

206
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,700
No way.

207
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,510
Hold on!

208
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,710
Where are you going?!

209
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,750
To the King, obviously.

210
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you want to come with me?

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,460
I doubt you could handle it.

212
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,470
His ability isn't teleportation, is it?

213
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,120
Then you'll have to carry the
guy in sunglasses to a doctor,

214
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,730
or you struck this deal for nothing.

215
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,520
If protecting the King was his first priority,

216
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,200
he should have killed all three on the spot.

217
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,280
It's no big deal...

218
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,250
You weaklings can attack me all you
want, but I'll still shake you off.

219
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,170
The fact that he was aware of this,
but didn't carry it out,

220
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,330
irritated Youpi on a level that didn't
compare to his previous rage.

221
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,810
Come for me whenever you want.

222
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,260
I'll fight you as equals.

223
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,560
I don't need to kill you right now...

224
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,210
And that's all there is to it!

225
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,150
Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit.

226
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,820
During this battle, Youpi had learned
how profound Nen really was.

227
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,190
That also altered what little
sense of self he'd had before.

228
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,990
Having learned to quarantine
his rage and stay calm,

229
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,670
Youpi had lost his ability to
see things in simple terms.

230
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,380
They're responsible for the rage I've built up,

231
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,380
so why don't I feel like using it on them?

232
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,510
What, or who, am I supposed
to unleash this rage upon?

233
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,420
Was this a sign of maturation?

234
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,290
Youpi wasn't sure.

235
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,450
However, as for Knuckle...

236
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,150
I completely lost...

237
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,590
Knuckle!

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,340
We gotta help the big guy!

239
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,910
Come on, boss.

240
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,600
I told you to leave me here...

241
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,860
Go!

242
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,680
The two of you...

243
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,450
can still fight.

244
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
Do what you can.

245
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,730
He said to go whenever you want.

246
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,630
So go now!

247
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,150
I can't.

248
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,960
I can no longer think of him...

249
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,390
as a target to destroy.

250
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,390
Wait...

251
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,420
He acknowledged our efforts.

252
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,360
He wasn't a bad guy.

253
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,900
In that case, I no longer have...

254
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,430
any reason to defeat him.

255
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,410
The King...

256
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,660
Knov-san!

257
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,410
The soldiers are not important.

258
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,210
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.

259
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,740
I'll take care of Morel...

260
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,430
Shoot is also okay.

261
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,530
Are you guys also coming?

262
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,900
Wait, let me sock this baby hard.

263
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,690
I received a message from
the chairman's messenger.

264
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,940
As planned, he was able to take the
King to the appointed location.

265
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,690
If they leave now, the Royal
Guard won't make it in time.

266
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,130
Their job is done, and so is ours.

267
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,720
Where's Palm?

268
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,080
We don't know yet.

269
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,260
Okay...

270
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,460
What will you do?

271
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,930
I don't know if I'll be back again.

272
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,840
You can see how bad I look...

273
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,340
Are you going or staying?

274
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,220
We're staying.

275
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,180
We still have a job to do.

276
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,850
I see.

277
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,020
You're strong...

278
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,120
Let's go.

279
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,340
To look for Palm?

280
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,710
No, we can do that later.

281
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,240
There's something else we have to do.

282
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,310
Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!

283
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,630
Next time: Pose x And x Name.

284
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,730
Hey, Killua... Say my name.

285
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,350
Huh? Why now?

286
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,770
Just do it!

287
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Gon.

288
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
Killua.
