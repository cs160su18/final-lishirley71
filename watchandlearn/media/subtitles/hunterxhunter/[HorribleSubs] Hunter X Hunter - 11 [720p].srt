2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,330
Then, I'll let go of him.

10
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,560
Whoa! Wait!

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm awake! I'm awake...

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,180
Don't let me go!

13
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,570
However, you're down to twenty hours.

14
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,070
But now we have a 2-1 lead.

15
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,070
Now...

16
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,750
It's your turn!

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,160
What do you want to bet on?

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,170
Trouble x With The x Gamble

19
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,630
In the five-on-five battle
with the prisoners,

20
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,630
Gon and his friends lead 2-1.

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,890
They're one win away from victory.

22
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,180
The fourth round is a series of wagers,
with time as the stakes.

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,600
What will they bet on next?

24
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,600
Well, are you going to tell me
what the next bet will be?

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,700
Or have you lost your nerve because
I've figured out your scheme?

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,070
Very well.

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,710
Leroute
112-year sentence, illegal gambling
and endangered species trafficking

28
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,160
H-Huh?

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,710
She's really cute...

30
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,830
That old guy's probably
dancing on the inside.

31
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,970
I have a bad feeling about this.

32
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,600
Then let's bet on whether
I'm a man or a woman.

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,060
Huh?

34
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,310
What's wrong?

35
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,150
Is there a problem?

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,560
N-No.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,060
She's obviously a woman...

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,480
Or could she be a tranny?

39
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,350
No, she's gotta be a woman.

40
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,230
That's fine,

41
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,330
but how will you prove if I'm wrong?

42
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,250
Oh, right...

43
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,140
I'll let you examine every part of my body.

44
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,210
Until you're fully satisfied.

45
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,610
Seriously?

46
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,800
Her body?

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,440
Leorio will bet she's a man.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,460
Uh-huh.

49
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,310
Huh? Why?

50
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,120
Okay, I've decided.

51
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,310
I bet ten hours that you're a man!

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,750
I knew it.

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,730
Dirty old man...

54
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,820
Huh? But how did you know?

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,950
This way, even if I'm wrong,
and it turns out she's female,

56
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,200
I'll still get to examine her body!

57
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,580
It's a win-win situation.

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,110
Actually, please be wrong...

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,230
There you have it.

60
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,710
I get it now.

61
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,970
Okay! Reveal the answer!

62
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,220
Too bad... I'm a woman.

63
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,230
R-Really?

64
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,730
Would you like to check?

65
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,590
B-B-But of course!

66
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,250
A mistake I do not regret.

67
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,620
Just watching hurts...

68
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,250
He's gonna lose.

69
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,340
Huh?

70
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,010
The opponent has seen through
Leorio's strategy.

71
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,350
He's been betting conservatively,

72
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,010
to minimize damage from either outcome.

73
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,020
A gambler who focuses on avoiding
a loss won't ever win.

74
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,520
I guess Leorio just doesn't
have what it takes.

75
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,900
As expected.

76
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,780
His approach to gambling
doesn't frighten me at all.

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,910
He'll never beat me that way.

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
Now it's your turn to think of a gamble.

79
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,100
What do you want to bet on?

80
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,750
This is no time to celebrate.

81
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,430
I only have ten hours left...

82
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,670
Leorio has no more room for error.

83
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,380
If he loses the next wager,
the overall score will be 2-2.

84
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,940
And we will have fifty fewer hours
to escape this tower.

85
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,690
Leorio...

86
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,280
I can't lose the next bet,

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,060
but I can't think of anything
that'd be a surefire win...

88
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,030
Oh, that's it!

89
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,280
We can bet on whether I'm
a man or a woman.

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,460
No, that wouldn't work...

91
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,570
Hey, old man...

92
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,390
You're thinking aloud.

93
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,590
I know.

94
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,950
Leorio!

95
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,110
Huh?

96
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,490
How about whether or not
you're still in your teens?

97
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,020
Come on, Gon!

98
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,560
I don't look that old...

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,690
I'm clearly a teenager!

100
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,230
T-Teenager?

101
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,610
But he looks like an old man.

102
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,610
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!

103
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,610
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!

104
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,620
Sure.

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,430
Rock-paper-scissors?

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,950
Why did he have to pick
such a difficult wager?

107
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,760
Huh?

108
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,120
Rock-paper-scissors is hard?

109
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,130
I happen to be quite confident in
my rock-paper-scissors skill.

110
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,510
Just recently, I won a gourmet vacation
in a tournament in the shopping district.

111
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,280
Let's see, then.

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,270
I'll put eighty hours on my victory.

113
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,140
E-Eighty hours?

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,310
Is something wrong?

115
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm free to bet as much as I want.

116
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
W-Well, that's true.

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,400
And if you lose, I can still only
take ten from you.

118
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,410
Don't worry.

119
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,750
She doesn't need to bet eighty.

120
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,410
Ten would suffice.

121
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,620
What if she loses?

122
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,390
Or is she that confident?

123
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,210
As anticipated, he's starting to stress.

124
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,930
He's so easy to read.

125
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,510
While rock-paper-scissors has simple rules,

126
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,930
the game itself is quite complex.

127
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,840
If you consider the game
from a probability standpoint,

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,110
there's only a one-third chance of losing.

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,980
However, if your opponent can predict
your reasoning and control your reactions,

130
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,450
defeat becomes much more likely.

131
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,400
In other words, simple-minded Leorio

132
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,060
will be at a disadvantage.

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,710
I see.

134
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,520
All right! I've made my decision.

135
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,360
What?

136
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
It's obvious what you'll use.

137
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,970
I can read minds.

138
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,740
Liar!

139
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,240
Your bluffing won't scare me!

140
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,980
You'll believe me soon enough.

141
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,990
As planned, he's losing his
cool over a blatant lie.

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,000
She can read minds?

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,310
She's lying. She must be lying...

144
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,990
But what if she's telling the truth?

145
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,030
Leorio will use rock.

146
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,620
Huh?

147
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
Let's do this!

148
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,790
Rock...

149
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,790
Paper...

150
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,590
Scissors!

151
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,820
You were right.

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,360
Good guess.

153
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,290
Nervous people unconsciously avoid

154
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,390
any action that involves opening up.

155
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,390
In other words, by making
Leorio uncomfortable, she ensures

156
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,830
that he's less likely to use paper.

157
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,690
So if she sticks with rock,

158
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,900
she's guaranteed a win or draw.

159
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,620
As I was explaining, rock-paper-scissors
is actually a mind game.

160
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,410
Now I see.

161
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,380
Hold on.

162
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,760
Since we both used rock, wasn't that a draw?

163
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,230
What of it?

164
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,420
A-ha!

165
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,860
So you were lying about being
able to read my mind!

166
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,550
If you really could, you'd have won.

167
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,510
Right?

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,450
What's so funny?

169
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,180
I deliberately gave you that tie.

170
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,530
Quit lying!

171
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,290
Did you forget?

172
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,420
We're trying to stall you here.

173
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,900
If I chose to, I could force an
indefinite series of draws...

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,660
But that wouldn't be any fun.

175
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,660
So I'll end this with the next turn.

176
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,010
Well? What will you use next?

177
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,100
Think hard.

178
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,030
Come on.

179
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,670
Damn!

180
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,500
That's it.

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,670
Worry. Fret.

182
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Worrying. Fretting.

183
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,040
When someone loses confidence,
they crave reassurance.

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,050
That makes him more likely to
either use the same hand,

185
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,890
or, in an effort to regain his confidence,

186
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,520
to use a stronger one than
in the previous round.

187
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,440
Meaning

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,200
that she wants Leorio to choose
either rock or paper.

189
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,550
Yes.

190
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,680
If she uses paper, she's certain not to lose.

191
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,950
Then Leorio just needs to stay a step ahead!

192
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,460
Well, if he could calm down,
that might work.

193
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,110
Leorio!

194
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
What is it?

195
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,470
Hey, you'll win if you go with scissors next!

196
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,880
What? Scissors?

197
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,470
Go ahead and try.

198
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,350
Then she'll just use rock.

199
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,480
No, she'll go a step further
and choose paper.

200
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,180
Wait, then she'll take another
step and use scissors...

201
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,990
No, no, then she'll take
another step and use rock...

202
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,990
Man, I have no idea what to think!

203
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,240
Here we go!

204
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,240
Here...

205
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,990
comes the...

206
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,240
draw!

207
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,960
I win!

208
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,850
Rock-paper-scissors really is complicated.

209
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,760
Now the score is 2-2.

210
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,140
Worse yet, we have to give up
the fifty hours he lost.

211
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,570
Sorry. I was pretty confident in my
rock-paper-scissors ability.

212
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,510
Pretty pathetic showing, then.

213
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,550
What was that?!

214
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,030
Well, I can't argue with you on this one.

215
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,800
Say, how much time do
they have left now?

216
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,980
Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes.

217
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,800
Which means

218
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,810
they actually have fewer
than ten hours left.

219
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,060
It doesn't matter how much time they have.

220
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,800
Because my opponent will die.

221
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:41,170
Hunter Vocabulary

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,170
Rock-Paper-Scissors

223
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,780
It's finally time for the last round.

224
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,400
Guess I'm off.

225
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,520
What? Killua?

226
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,930
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,850
Damn it! I really needed
to win my round...

228
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,760
Gon... This guy is totally pissing me off!

229
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,810
Now, now.

230
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,560
Don't give up before we even know
what the contest is.

231
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,310
Well, if it's something like
mental math, I'm surrendering.

232
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,440
That's right!

233
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,330
Depending on the opponent,
we still have a chance!

234
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,830
That little kid is their last member.

235
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,750
Never thought I'd see him
fall prey to that monster.

236
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,330
Poor thing. He's still so young.

237
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,500
I didn't want to use him.

238
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,390
However, the Hunter Exam has no mercy.

239
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,380
If he dies here, that's fate.

240
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm removing his handcuffs.

241
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,040
You guys are getting too scared...

242
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,120
Idiot, stop!

243
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,260
Is he really that terrifying?

244
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,370
Isn't it all just ancient history?

245
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,760
That guy...

246
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,010
You know him?

247
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,850
We should take the loss.

248
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,840
Killua!

249
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,240
Don't fight him.

250
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,290
Why not?

251
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,540
Johness the Dissector.

252
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,780
Johness
968-year sentence, mass murder

253
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,270
The worst mass murderer in Zaban's history.

254
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,380
He chose his victims randomly.

255
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,760
It was a famous case...

256
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,310
146 people, young and old, men and women,
met with brutal deaths by his hand.

257
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,500
The victims had one thing in common.

258
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,820
He murdered all of them
with his bare hands.

259
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,820
He was known for his iron grip,

260
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,790
the power in his fingers.

261
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,660
It's been so long since
I touched human flesh.

262
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,400
You don't have to face that psychotic killer...

263
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
There's always next year.

264
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,890
Hey, Killua...

265
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,530
Killua!

266
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,870
Damn it, was he even listening to me?!

267
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,500
We should let him go.

268
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,250
He could have a plan.

269
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,760
How are we settling this contest?

270
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
Contest?

271
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,990
I believe you're confused.

272
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,830
This will be a one-sided massacre.

273
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,500
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.

274
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,950
I just want to hear you scream.

275
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,120
Really? Okay.

276
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,010
Then the loser is the one who dies.

277
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,860
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,550
I'll tear your body apart.

279
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,640
Wh-What?

280
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm so cold.

281
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,760
That's...

282
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,990
mine.

283
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,990
G-Give it back.

284
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,460
Okay. That's three wins, two losses.

285
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,740
We pass, right?

286
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah, you win.

287
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,060
By the way, you must be
itching for some action,

288
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,270
since you didn't get to do anything.

289
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,810
Want to play with me?

290
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,310
I'll abstain.

291
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,070
Oh, okay.

292
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,410
Who is he?

293
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,410
That's right. You guys don't know.

294
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,830
Huh? Don't know what?

295
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,830
Killua comes from an elite family of assassins.

296
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,330
Eh? A-An elite family of assassins?

297
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm back.

298
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,550
What?

299
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,580
Uh... Well,

300
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,030
good work!

301
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,850
Across the bridge,

302
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,940
you'll find a small room.

303
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,110
You must spend the fifty hours
you gambled away there.

304
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,750
Well, let's go.

305
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah!

306
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,770
R-Right...

307
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,030
Gittarackur, applicant #301,
is the second to pass.

308
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,950
Total time, twelve hours
and two minutes.

309
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,320
I figured you'd already
crossed the finish line.

310
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,010
All right!

311
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Hanzo, applicant #294, is the third to pass.

312
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,170
I'm the first to finish!

313
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,750
Huh?

314
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,170
Total time, twelve hours
and three minutes.

315
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,170
No!

316
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,780
I don't believe this...

317
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,410
I came in third.

318
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,100
Good grief.

319
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,370
We have to spend fifty hours
in this room?

320
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,670
Killua.

321
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,520
Huh?

322
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,510
Can you tell me how that
technique works?

323
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,930
Technique?

324
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,050
The one you used to instantly
remove his heart.

325
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,760
Oh, that wasn't even a technique.

326
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,240
I just ripped it out.

327
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,140
Ripped it out?

328
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,810
But to make it easier,

329
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,820
I manipulated my body a bit.

330
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,790
Y-Your nails...

331
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,240
Wow!

332
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,490
Mass murderers are still only amateurs.

333
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,180
I used to be a professional.

334
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,540
But my old man would've done better.

335
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,040
When he removes a heart, you won't
see even a drop of blood.

336
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,000
How reassuring.

337
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,750
As long as he's on our side...

338
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,010
Well, then.

339
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,290
We have more than two whole days.

340
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,470
What should we do, Killua?

341
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,900
First, we should search the room

342
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,670
for any kind of entertainment.

343
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,520
Yeah!

344
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,020
Man, you kids don't have
a care in the world.

345
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,250
Gon's team of five has passed the trial,
with three wins and two losses.

346
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,290
However, they must spend the fifty-hour
penalty in this small room.

347
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,760
They're running out of time.

348
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,380
Next time: Last x Test Of x Resolve!

349
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,440
Think like a fish!

350
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,500
You can do that?

351
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,560
Yep!
