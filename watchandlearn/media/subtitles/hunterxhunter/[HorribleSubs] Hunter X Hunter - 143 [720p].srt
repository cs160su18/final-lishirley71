5th Election for the 13th Chairman

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,740
In the fifth vote in the election
for the 13th chairman,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,740
6) Botobai — 26
7) Mizaistom — 21
8) Morel — 20
9) Biscuit — 18
10) Saccho — 16
11) Linne — 15
12) Cutie — 10
13) Ging — 7
14) Sanbica — 3
15) Loupe, Bushidora — 0
Valid Votes: 633 (28 Absentees)
Turnout: 95.8%

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,370
Pariston placed first.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,620
But since he didn't receive
the majority of the valid votes,

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,990
1) Pariston — 274 (41.4%)
2) Teradein — 77
3) Cheadle — 63
4) Leorio — 55
5) Ickshonpe — 28

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,990
those in the top eight must hold a runoff.

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,980
What? Talk about my loss?

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,820
Cutie Beauty

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,010
I haven't lost.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,000
Our beloved Pariston will bring my dream
of a cutiful Hunter Association to life.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,460
Biscuit Krueger

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,100
Yeah, that old man...

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,130
I mean, Netero...

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,290
I'm sure everyone knows
how crazy he could be.

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,470
But there's one thing I can say.

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,880
Just like in the battle with the Ants,

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,640
you can't escape danger just
by being good all the time!

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,020
That's a fact!

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,310
Ging Freecss

22
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,770
Saccho Kobayakawa

23
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,740
Well...

24
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,690
I'll continue to support the
Association behind the scenes.

25
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,830
I won't proffer any names,

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,700
but I hope you vote for someone worth supporting.

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,150
Sanbica Norton

28
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,290
I would like to thank all
those who voted for me...

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,190
But please stop...

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,040
Linne Hors-d'oeuvre

31
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,010
Sin x And x Claw

32
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,280
Yes, hello?

33
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,950
Somehow,

34
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,280
I managed to obtain a map.

35
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,160
It has routes and destinations for all six airships.

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,720
They seem to be on one of
the two remaining airships.

37
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,260
Want me to send a picture?

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,250
I'll be using Texture Surprise to
change it a little, though.

39
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,300
It's okay.

40
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,930
An idiot over here was carrying the map, too.

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,930
And I already know which airship Killua took.

42
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,740
Okay.

43
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,440
Oh, right... He has a spotter.

44
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,700
Someone's watching me?

45
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,020
I don't think I'm so senile that someone
could tail me when I'm tailing another.

46
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,960
Since the mission began, I've felt eyes on me.

47
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,470
They're quite far away,
yet I can't shake them off.

48
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,660
This is the first time that's happened.

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,510
This person must be very good...

50
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,770
Amane, come here!

51
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,640
We're going to fly!

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,350
Yes!

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,550
Fortunately, it appears that
clouds have come out tonight.

54
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,890
Master Killua is sure to use
that to his advantage.

55
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,730
As expected...

56
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,570
You're late. Let's go!

57
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,490
Yes!

58
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,610
Tsubone's power,

59
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,210
known as Rider's High,

60
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,350
allows her to transform herself
into various different vehicles.

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,720
However, the vehicles are
fueled by the rider's aura,

62
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,070
so she cannot use her power alone.

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,490
When we're above the clouds,

64
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,730
no one can watch us from the ground,
no matter how strong the scope.

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,080
Amane, if there are any suspicious aircraft
around, we'll take them down.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,820
Yes!

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,740
Well...

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,430
There's still time before either ship will land.

69
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,350
I'll help Hisoka out a bit longer.

70
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,500
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

71
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,970
The target has yet to appear.

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,010
We've lost all contact with Point C!

73
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,100
Nothing has happened at Point A.

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,510
Should we tell them to send support?

75
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,580
We can't assume that Point A is safe.

76
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,130
Illumi manipulates others with his needles.

77
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,320
He may control that area already.

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,650
You're saying he's killed over twenty people?

79
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,010
It doesn't matter how many
amateurs we throw at him.

80
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,700
We should warn the pros who are
going after the Needlemen.

81
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,670
Latun and Kenzaki aren't answering.

82
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,750
What?

83
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,540
The two airships they were
following are in close proximity.

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,720
Most likely...

85
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,930
It looks like I must go.

86
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,430
It's a chance to show that I'm worthy
to be Captain of the Seirin Group!

87
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,220
What about the election?

88
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,320
Those who are able should still go.

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,570
Even if we exclude everyone who's hunting,

90
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,820
we can still finish in the top four.

91
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,480
We must continue voting in the election.

92
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,700
Even if we can't predict the outcome, I don't
want to manipulate it through absenteeism.

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,230
Why don't we hire Association Hunters?

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,100
If we show that we're trying to carry on
the spirit of the Hunter Association,

95
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,460
we could win some of the votes
that are defaulting to Pariston.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,840
He's right. We should move immediately!

97
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,220
If everything works out,
the Association Hunters will be killed

98
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,200
and miss the next vote.

99
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,970
If I told him that, I'm sure Teradein would object.

100
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,320
If we can't predict the outcome,

101
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,000
we should force more absentees,
so it will be invalid.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Teradein is too honest,

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,940
and Bushidora can't plan well.

104
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,870
Teradein-san has requested Hunters in
compliance with the Association's terms?

105
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,340
Magnificent!

106
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,930
That's wonderful!

107
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,520
Accept the request! Do the job!

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,920
You don't need to be concerned about me.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,320
In fact, if there's no limit on the
number of Hunters we can send,

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,390
spread the word and take everyone.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,920
If you come across anything you want
to ask or tell me while on the job,

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,290
feel free to contact me anytime.

113
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,260
If anything needs to be improved,
we can work it out.

114
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,480
Yes, they make an excellent trio.

115
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,810
I like them...

116
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,470
They're so easy to understand.

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,130
6th Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 661

118
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,050
The vote's invalid because the turnout was 91.2%.

119
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,050
1) Pariston — 272 (41.1%)
2) Teradein — 73
3) Cheadle — 66
4) Leorio — 58
5) Morel — 53
6) Mizaistom — 44
7) Botobai — 37
8) Ickshonpe — 0
Valid Votes: 603 (58 Absentees)
Turnout: 91.2% (Invalid)

120
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,930
What's going on?

121
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,550
Teradein!

122
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,200
Everyone pursuing the Needlemen was wiped out.

123
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,810
Our members, the camera crew,
and the Association Hunters!

124
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,440
Even Bushidora!

125
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,440
Impossible!

126
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,860
Illumi must have hired dozens of strong soldiers!

127
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,630
More like one.

128
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,390
Since we took flight, I haven't
felt anyone watching us.

129
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,290
Which means we really were being tailed before.

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
The clouds have cleared up...

131
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,350
Well, since we're this far from
the hospital, it should be fine.

132
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,560
If anyone sees Alluka when we enter the hospital,

133
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,360
Tsubone will say that Alluka's
power has been revealed,

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,870
and she'll take us home immediately.

135
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,870
But if I clear the area, that'll only
make it easier for Illumi to act.

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,330
Taking this airship to the
hospital would be difficult.

137
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,210
Gotoh's idea to drive a car straight
into the hospital may be best.

138
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,700
Canary?

139
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,140
I can't reach Gotoh.

140
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,710
Neither can I.

141
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,640
Then I need you to tell Hishita and
the rest to send cars immediately

142
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,940
to the following three locations.

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,930
I understand.

144
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,400
We've lost the ground pursuit
by flying above the clouds.

145
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,220
We'll be fine until we're in the car.

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,290
After that, we have to pick the
best route to the hospital.

147
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
Gon...

148
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,770
Hang in there.

149
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,720
Okay... Nice timing, Hishita.

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,210
Since we had to loop around, it took longer.

151
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,580
But now we're sixty kilometers
from the hospital.

152
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,040
They can't find us.

153
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,610
Take us to the hospital.

154
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,600
At once.

155
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,290
What's wrong?

156
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,210
There are people in front of the car.

157
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,620
Those...

158
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,670
are Needlemen!

159
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,250
Impossible! How?

160
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,880
Following us should have been impossible!

161
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,310
Was it the car? Did they follow the car?

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,340
Hishita, hit the gas!

163
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,640
They're beyond help anyway!

164
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,010
I can't do that, Master Killua.

165
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,020
Not unless Master Illumi orders it.

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,680
Wh-What?!

167
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
We're completely surrounded.

168
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,780
Impossible...

169
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,840
How can he be here?

170
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,560
Illumi...

171
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,920
How?!

172
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,530
It's impossible...

173
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,480
Unless he knew which airship we were on!

174
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,470
No, that's not right...

175
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,390
Even if he knew which airship,
he couldn't be here.

176
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,690
We flew dozens of kilometers over the clouds.

177
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,600
He couldn't have followed us on the ground!

178
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,490
Kil,

179
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,560
you seem to be hiding something
from me about Alluka.

180
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,950
Do I use Godspeed

181
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,100
to get Hishita out of the car
and use it to escape?

182
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Or do I go back to the airship
and try to escape by air?

183
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,380
If I were alone, those options would work.

184
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,470
But it'd be hard to manage
that and keep Alluka safe.

185
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,960
How did you know we were here?

186
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,970
If I tell you, will you give me Alluka?

187
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,270
Forget it.

188
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,970
I won't ask.

189
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,480
Alluka has an ordinary child's strength.

190
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,320
A single attack from one of the
Needlemen could be lethal.

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,730
What do I do?

192
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,810
I have to summon Something.

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,480
It's me.

194
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,250
The fool who was completely tricked.

195
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh, it's Tsubone!

196
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,630
Your mother can see everything

197
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,640
that I see through this scope.

198
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,880
She probably transmitted the
video to you, Master Illumi.

199
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,020
Bingo. Tsubone served as my spy.

200
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,810
When the clouds cleared,

201
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,980
I felt eyes on me again and realized the truth.

202
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,160
The timing was too perfect.

203
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,040
Ah, so you actually felt us watching...

204
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,660
You're really something.

205
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,440
Well, now you know the truth,

206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,150
but you can't remove that scope because
Mom ordered you to wear it.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,920
Yes, you're completely right.

208
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,920
Tsubone,

209
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,930
give me the nail from your middle finger.

210
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,430
Yes, absolutely.

211
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,690
Here you are, Master.

212
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,700
Tsubone, give me the nail
from your ring finger.

213
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,050
Yes, that's easy enough.

214
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Tsubone, I appreciate it.

215
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,520
Now, Master Killua...

216
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,980
Make your wish.

217
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,720
Amane and I will take care of the rest.

218
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,620
Please allow me this opportunity to
make amends for impeding your mission.

219
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,920
Are you going to do it?

220
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
Fine...

221
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,610
That means when you save Gon,
you'll follow the same process, right?

222
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,400
If you'd sacrifice those two to kill me,

223
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,780
you won't have any problem sacrificing
a bunch of strangers to save Gon.

224
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,510
Rule 5...

225
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,480
The same person can't make
two wishes in a row.

226
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,260
Would it be more fun to kill Alluka,
earning Killua's wrath,

227
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,860
or more fun to spare Alluka and save
Gon, making Illumi my enemy?

228
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,650
Tough call...

229
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,610
If you say yes, I'll be happy to die.

230
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,700
Your inner mission will have succeeded.

231
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,940
It's against the rules for family
members to kill one another,

232
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,540
but the thing that will grant your wish...

233
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,150
isn't family.

234
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,260
Assuming there's a secret rule that
makes rule 5 not apply to Killua...

235
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,590
If my death means no other family
will die, that's acceptable.

236
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,920
Killua will suffer for the rest of his life.

237
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,750
I will live in his heart forever.

238
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,780
Go ahead, then.

239
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm offering a deal, Kil...

240
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,450
My death in exchange for your word
that you yourself will make the wish

241
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,960
to save Gon.

242
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,030
Alluka lives while Illumi dies,

243
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,850
but I don't earn Killua's wrath.

244
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,840
So if Gon is healed, I neither gain nor lose anything.

245
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,720
In that case,

246
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,720
I will kill Alluka to earn Killua's wrath,

247
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,010
then take out Killua to earn Illumi's wrath.

248
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,550
That is the best choice...

249
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,360
Something,

250
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,000
heal Tsubone's left hand.

251
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,920
'Kay.

252
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,060
Hand. Hand.

253
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,570
Tsubone, put out your left hand.

254
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,030
Master Killua, but...

255
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,820
Just do it.

256
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,030
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.

257
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,580
When she's fixing, she must touch the target.

258
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,790
But...

259
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,520
'Kay.

260
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,710
Killua, pat my head!

261
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,930
Of course, I will.

262
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,670
That was amazing, Something.

263
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,380
Something is the one who calls me "Killua."

264
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,110
Healing someone is tiring,
so Something must sleep.

265
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,680
But that's it.

266
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,560
Something has never made a cruel
request after healing someone!

267
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,330
Something is kinder than anyone.

268
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,490
The one who's cursed is the one who wishes.

269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,210
If you refer to Something as an object again,

270
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,820
I won't consider you my brother anymore.

271
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,220
Got it, Kil.

272
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,460
If you can heal Gon without any risk, that's terrific.

273
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,110
But that doesn't change the fact
that Something is dangerous,

274
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,260
and my questions remain unanswered.

275
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,420
Kil, you're still hiding something.

276
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,670
Such as how Milluki's rule 5 doesn't apply to you.

277
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,620
Until you tell me everything,
I won't let Alluka go.

278
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,090
Stupid!

279
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,430
That's why I can't tell you anything.

280
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,950
If you knew the last rule, you'd...

281
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,010
No, all of you...

282
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,320
would put needles in my head again.

283
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,520
Master Killua, I will take you to the hospital.

284
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,530
Captain Bushidora, of the Seirin Group,

285
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,590
was killed in pursuit of the wicked Hunter
that we hoped to bring to justice.

286
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,620
This confirms that demons are hiding among us!

287
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,090
However, I regret to say that the Seirin Group

288
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,130
does not have the power to bring the
Hunter, or Hunters, to justice.

289
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,330
Everyone! This is an urgent matter

290
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,300
that the Association must band
together to resolve at once!

291
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:15,030
That is why our goal is to ensure
that voter turnout exceeds 95%,

292
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,630
and that the winner has a majority!

293
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,170
Thus, we are currently in negotiations
with Morel, who has strong ties with

294
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,490
the former chairman's faction, in hopes
that he will be our new captain.

295
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,070
At the same time, we are prepared
to reveal the name, face, and abilities

296
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,550
of this demon to prevent further tragedy.

297
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,150
If you agree with our ideals, please...

298
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,380
cast a vote for Teradein!

299
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,480
Oh, uh...

300
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm pretty sure I turned you down.

301
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,680
Can't you reconsider?

302
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,410
I agree that I was fairly close
to the former chairman,

303
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,400
and I participated in the Ant extermination.

304
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,280
But I'm not a warrior.

305
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,650
It was determined that my support was required,

306
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,580
given the nature of the operation.

307
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,550
I wouldn't say that I'm strong.

308
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,660
But...

309
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,330
Didn't you watch them introduce the top sixteen?

310
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm a Sea Hunter!

311
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,300
I belong in the water. I'm a water man.

312
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,740
I don't belong on land.

313
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,170
Can't you adapt?

314
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,490
And if you're in a hurry to end the election,

315
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,370
you could tell your supporters to vote for Pariston!

316
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,350
Though, I'd rather die than vote for him...

317
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,680
One last thing.

318
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,190
If you release his identity,

319
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,410
you and a bunch of other fools will end up dying.

320
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,320
And don't use the "Seirin Group"
name when you're so weak!

321
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,380
I'm not interested in teaming up with
people who won't heed my warnings,

322
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,450
and I'm not interested in becoming chairman.

323
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,290
I'm done!

324
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:05,910

The results of the seventh vote call

Four remain.

327
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,800
Is everything going according to Pariston's plan?

328
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,690
What does it take to move the human heart?

329
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,860
Next time: Approval x And x Coalition.
