2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,740
The Hunters have entered the palace in
order to defeat the Chimera Ant King.

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,290
My attacks don't work?

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,330
What is this thing?

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,020
Don't you run!

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,090
Answer me!

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,200
What is this thing?!

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,480
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,600
If you wanna know, catch me first!

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,150
To save the injured Shoot,

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,610
Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention.

12
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,910
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,640
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,360
In that case...

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,140
I must not lose consciousness...

16
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,000
If I pass out,

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,760
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...

18
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:45,090
Every little bit of damage counts...

19
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,000
I can still fight...

20
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,530
I can still...

21
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,440
Right now, my job...

22
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,400
isn't to help Shoot!

23
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,010
It's to use my power to help the others,

24
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,500
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,690
Though it broke his heart,
Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters

26
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,500
and follow Gon and Killua instead,
in order to fulfill his mission.

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,620
Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into
the depths of the palace to rescue Palm.

28
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,830
Satellite Dragonflies!

29
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm gonna rescue her.

30
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,860
Palm is a friend of a friend.

31
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,240
That makes her a friend...

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,810
My friend!

33
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,290
As Morel, the first Hunter
to reach the throne room,

34
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,790
waited to continue his battle with Pouf,
who remained in his cocoon,

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,250
Netero and the King were leaving the palace,

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,370
and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,

37
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,020
their target for avenging Kite.

38
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,010
Revenge x And x Recovery

39
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,170
Do you

40
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,280
remember me?

41
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,770
I'm Gon Freecss!

42
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,600
I came here

43
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,350
to get Kite back from you!

44
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,360
Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.

45
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,120
The only thing on Pitou's mind was
surviving the current threat

46
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,760
while carrying out the King's order.

47
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,180
Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.

48
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,630
I must protect Komugi...

49
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,940
At any cost!

50
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,630
Something's not right.

51
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,890
Watching from a short distance, Killua
noticed that something was strange.

52
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,080
Why isn't the enemy preparing for
battle when we're right here?

53
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,650
I can't sense any aura at all...

54
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,650
Pitou might as well be completely
naked... Utterly defenseless.

55
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,650
Does Pitou think it can win without aura?

56
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,160
No, that isn't possible.

57
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,760
The aura coming from Gon now
doesn't even compare to his usual.

58
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,400
Even Pitou can't fight that without using Nen.

59
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,270
Is it because of where we are?

60
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,700
Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,

61
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,480
there'll be time to activate Nen if we do attack?

62
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,660
That's possible.

63
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,480
However, for some reason...

64
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,290
That doesn't seem to be it.

65
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,510
It almost looks like...

66
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,970
That's it.

67
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,000
It looks like...

68
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,300
a mother

69
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,600
using its own body to guard something weaker.

70
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,470
That's ridiculous.

71
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,380
Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,250
But then, why did Grandpa...

73
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,080
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.

74
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,890
...say something that cryptic?

75
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,000
While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,

76
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,190
the girl lying before them brought back

77
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,860
images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind.

78
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,380
Get away from her.

79
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,390
I'm telling you to take that
monster and get away from her.

80
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,270
And then, fight me!

81
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,170
Fight me, so I can get Kite back!

82
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,670
The act of placing both palms face-up
to display one's lack of malice

83
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,170
was a gesture Killua recognized...

84
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,080
Please

85
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,330
wait.

86
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,910
What the hell?!

87
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,860
What am I supposed to wait for?

88
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Get up! We're going outside!

89
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,610
Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance

90
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,910
left Gon without a target for his rage.

91
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,110
Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully
understanding the current situation.

92
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,870
It was...

93
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,660
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.

94
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,200
He was saying something
unexpected happened!

95
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,260
Grandpa knew nothing when
he brought the dragon down.

96
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,100
Grandpa's mission was probably

97
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,460
to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to
separate the King and Royal Guard.

98
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,290
But he didn't know that she was here, too.

99
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,110
Wait, this woman must be

100
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,320
the third party that none of us knew about!

101
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,370
And she's most likely

102
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,060
the reason the King hurt himself.

103
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,320
Why would the King do something
so out of character?

104
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,580
Because she is someone
who's special to the King.

105
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,200
Pitou isn't taking her apart.

106
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,750
Pitou is healing her at the King's command!

107
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,730
Pitou isn't only prevented from using
En when healing someone.

108
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,840
All aura must be focused on
healing ability when using it.

109
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,450
However, Killua knew that this
information would only have

110
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,500
a negative effect on Gon.

111
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,040
What do I do?

112
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,830
What do I tell him?

113
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,260
Go—

114
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,090
I'll do anything!

115
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,190
I'll do anything you say!

116
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
So please wait.

117
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,100
I...

118
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,320
must save this person!

119
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,450
Save...

120
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,860
Save what?

121
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,850
"Anything"?

122
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,110
When you say "anything"...

123
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,870
Killua...

124
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm asking the questions.

125
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,190
What is it that you must save?

126
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,650
Amidst the extreme tension,
the answer Pitou chose to give was...

127
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,410
This person is someone...

128
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,790
Someone who's important
to someone important to me.

129
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,810
...the truth.

130
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,000
She is the reason the King is who he is.

131
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,630
If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is.

132
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,340
She's that important.

133
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,180
So...

134
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,820
All I care about is saving her!

135
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,830
Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want.

136
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,110
So please wait!

137
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,990
You want to save her?

138
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,970
You must save her?

139
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,220
Save her?

140
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,360
How dare you say that...

141
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,740
How dare you?!

142
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,380
Damn it!

143
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,580
The hell if...

144
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,740
The hell if I'll listen to you!

145
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,630
Gon, hold on!

146
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,140
It's likely that we were
the ones that injured her.

147
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,090
It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.

148
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,150
And?

149
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:28,240
Pitou is probably telling the
truth about healing her.

150
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,900
So?

151
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,260
Let's wait until it's done.

152
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,490
"Likely"?

153
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,160
"Probably"?

154
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,510
You want me to wait because
of "likely" and "probably"?

155
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,920
And after we wait, it's likely that this thing

156
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,880
will do what I want?

157
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,740
Likely? Probably?

158
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,930
Seriously?!

159
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,930
That's crap!

160
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,390
That's just crap!

161
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,690
Is something wrong with you?!

162
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,700
You want... You want me to trust this thing?!

163
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,950
I can't do that!

164
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,380
If you want, you may also have my right arm...

165
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,720
If that isn't enough,

166
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,220
you can take both legs...

167
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,420
If you're worried I'll change my mind
after the healing finishes,

168
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,740
you can break any part of my body
that isn't required to heal her.

169
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,370
Please let me save her!

170
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,770
That isn't fair...

171
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,540
That isn't fair, damn it!

172
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,540
Why are you helping her,

173
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,300
after everything you did to Kite?!

174
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,270
Gon!

175
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,820
Why?!

176
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,300
Why?!

177
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,580
To hell with that.

178
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,590
First comes—

179
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,600
Gon, if you kill Pitou,

180
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,110
we'll never get Kite back.

181
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,430
You have it easy, Killua.

182
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,120
You're perfectly calm.

183
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,370
Since it means nothing to you...

184
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm only saying this because
you're out of control.

185
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,330
Did you forget the first thing
you said when we came here?

186
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,540
We're here to get Kite back!

187
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,040
Pull it together!

188
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,780
Yeah.

189
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,130
I'm okay now.

190
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,240
How long?

191
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,330
How long do I have to wait?

192
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,330
To completely heal her

193
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,090
will take three to four hours.

194
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,340
No, I can't wait that long.

195
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,100
If I have an hour,

196
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,050
I can heal her most critical injuries.

197
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,200
Please give me that.

198
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,370
In one hour, you're coming with
me to Peijing, to heal Kite.

199
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,870
Can you promise me that?

200
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,870
I swear to keep that promise!

201
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,940
I'll wait right here for one hour.

202
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,040
Next time: Insult x And x Payback.

203
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,050
I can't think of anything right now...

204
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,620
Killua, insult me back!

205
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,460
I... feel better now.
