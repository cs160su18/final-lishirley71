2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,730
Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,610
Can you kill them?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,940
You can count on me.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,470
Hmm... No problem.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,660
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,250
I will stop them all.

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,000
Tracking x And x Pursuit

9
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,910
Knuckle and Shoot are on the
move to capture Cheetu

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,660
as he attempts to return to the King.

11
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,630
He's close.

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,530
Okay.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
He's following the road.

14
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,010
If he continues on it,
he'll pass by in ten minutes.

15
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,750
Do you think he'll stick to the road?

16
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,470
No, he'll notice my presence
just before he gets here.

17
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,030
Because APR will start adding interest again.

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,530
But given his speed...

19
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,980
We may be able to attack him
just before APR adds interest.

20
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,910
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

21
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,920
Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,540
attaches APR to an enemy.

23
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,470
Every ten seconds, APR informs the
enemy that interest will be added.

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,850
But if the enemy is over a hundred meters
away from Knuckle, the interest stops.

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,830
When this happens, the time
until the next interest payment

26
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,150
is remembered by APR.

27
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,980
Once the enemy is back within
Knuckle's hundred-meter range,

28
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,030
APR picks up where it stopped.

29
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,080
He's approaching at a speed between
160 and 180 kilometers per hour.

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,830
If there are still three seconds or more
before APR adds interest again,

31
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,130
there's a good chance we can
attack before he notices us.

32
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,880
Here he comes!

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,620
What's wrong?

34
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,850
Damn, what happened?

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!

36
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,940
He's down below!

37
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,700
Knuckle...

38
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,300
Don't bother. We can't catch up.

39
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,820
Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.

40
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,530
He isn't supposed to know
how to deal with Zetsu.

41
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,020
How did he discover our ambush?

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,500
Could it be...

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,420
We're slightly downwind.

44
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,510
The breeze is blowing this way
with no change in direction.

45
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,790
So he didn't smell us.

46
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,610
Look up!

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
What's that?

48
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,790
I've discovered two suspicious figures.

49
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,690
What should I do?

50
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,500
Ignore them. They aren't the target.

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,440
No point in doing more work than necessary.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,190
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,830
It appears they were trying
to ambush Cheetu-sama.

54
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,950
Oh, he's in the area?

55
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,830
I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.

56
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,660
Was that unnecessary?

57
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,150
What did Cheetu do?

58
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,230
He took a detour toward the capital.

59
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,010
He told me to thank you for the help.

60
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,840
I see, good work.

61
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,870
He owes me now.

62
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,510
This is Leol.

63
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,700
The target just engaged a squad of
soldiers in the city of Longtong.

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,770
Longtong?

65
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,880
Head north and try to cut it off.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
Just a hunch.

67
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,850
Understood.

68
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,230
Looks like even the army can't handle this.

69
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,840
No... Well, they're only there to buy time.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,120
They've had to stay in one area
for a longer period of time.

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,680
After all, it's been moving constantly
for over thirty hours.

72
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,380
Diego has fallen into enemy hands!

73
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,640
If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!

74
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,050
Liar!

75
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,890
Rebel scum!

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,770
Damn... Diego just appeared on TV,
looking alive and well.

77
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,410
The odds are against me now.

78
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll have to give up my instigation.

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,020
My only option is to take out as many
puppets and soldiers as I can!

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,410
Should I go north next?

81
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,210
I knew it.

82
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,340
Someone's still following me!

83
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,430
Who's there?!

84
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,360
If you want something, show yourself!

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,400
The presence has completely vanished.

86
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,430
It might be following me until
more Chimera Ants show up.

87
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm gonna shake it!

88
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,860
It can't outlast me!

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Yo...

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,410
Yo.

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,080
Sorry for stopping you.

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,630
Nah, I was headed this way.

93
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,950
The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?

94
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,080
Yeah, I know. It's Leol now.

95
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,050
Then you did that on purpose?

96
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,840
You're still a bastard.

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,630
Flutter's warning was a big help.

98
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,810
Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights...

99
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm glad to hear that.

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,220
By the way, what's that thing?

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,820
No idea.

102
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,250
A Hunter hit me with it.

103
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,310
It follows me wherever I run.

104
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,230
Not sure what to do.

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,290
But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect.

106
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Want me to get rid of it?

107
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,740
Do you want me to get rid of it?

108
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,430
You can do that?

109
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,370
Probably.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,620
But not for free, right?

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm glad you're so understanding.

112
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,940
Figured.

113
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,160
The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.

114
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,040
I'd like your help.

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,380
Leol-sama...

116
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,350
I've spotted the target.

117
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,390
He's headed north on the road through
the forest northeast of Longtong.

118
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,050
Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...

119
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,210
Don't let him get away.

120
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,410
Use all your forces to slow him down.

121
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,400
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,510
We're chasing down a human.

123
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,990
He's probably a Hunter.

124
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,260
And you want me to help hunt him?

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,410
You said he's a Hunter?

126
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,380
They can be tough to deal with...

127
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,180
Of course, so I've planned ahead.

128
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,850
Shaiapouf-dono has prepared
a power tailored for you.

129
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,430
He will teach you to use it.

130
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,050
With luck, you can master it in a day.

131
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,460
I'm a slow learner, so mine took me
three days to get the hang of.

132
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,540
Sounds like a sweet deal...

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,950
In return, I swear loyalty to the King?

134
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,040
Exactly... Easy enough, right?

135
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,310
Sure, I just wanted an explanation.

136
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,850
You're a sharp fellow.

137
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,950
If you accept, return to the castle,

138
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,140
master your new power,
and then contact me.

139
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,270
In the meantime, I'll have my underlings
determine the target's abilities.

140
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,570
Well, I guess I owe you one.

141
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,990
Might as well.

142
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,080
Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory.

143
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,210
Naturally.

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,980
I was once king of the jungle.

145
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,800
Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne.

146
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,130
Damn, I'm being followed.

147
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,520
And he's way out of yo-yo range.

148
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,240
If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble.

149
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,500
There's a jungle over there!

150
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,810
The leaves are dense enough,

151
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,270
he shouldn't be able to see me from the air.

152
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,790
If he descends to follow,
he'll be in range of my yo-yo!

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,340
He isn't coming?

154
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,760
Did I lose him?

155
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,010
But in that case, he should
come looking for me.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
Damn...

157
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,860
I don't have time to wait around!

158
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,530
Hurry up, already!

159
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,530
You can't hide from me.

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,230
Go forth, soldiers of Leol.

161
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,290
Capture your prey!

162
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,390
Something's coming, but from the opposite side,

163
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,550
and it's on the ground!

164
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,320
He removed his foe's head
and arms with one swing!

165
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,770
I can't beat him in a one-on-one,
close-quarters fight...

166
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,480
Where is he?!

167
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,900
Captain! Above you!

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm gonna die—

169
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,980
I missed two of them!

170
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,170
We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
and we can't even touch him!

171
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,900
Retreat!

172
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,980
Time to regroup!

173
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,110
I won't let you escape...

174
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,110
You must be the leader.

175
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,940
I'll eliminate you first!

176
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,800
How'd you like that blast?

177
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,890
That bastard...

178
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,690
He blew a fart at me!

179
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,410
No, there's a bigger problem...

180
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,440
I completely concealed my presence,
and attacked from his blind spot.

181
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,750
But he countered at the perfect time.

182
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,980
Someone must be instructing
him from a distance.

183
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,790
It must be him!

184
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,040
He's probably watching right now.

185
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,670
I'd guess he has a power that
lets him track my location.

186
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,300
In that case...

187
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,680
I can't show him the cards
in my hand, no matter what.

188
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,110
I don't want them to learn
of my lightning or yo-yo!

189
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,390
The ideal scenario would be to lose
them and go back into hiding.

190
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,930
But that's looking impossible.

191
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,840
I'll have to defeat them all without using—

192
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,360
A gun?

193
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,430
No...

194
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,440
There's something stuck to my face...

195
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,960
A flea?

196
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,430
A flea?

197
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,290
Damn!

198
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,510
Where did it come from?!

199
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,670
Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2.

200
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,320
Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1.

201
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,770
Okay.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,740
There's no escaping...

203
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,400
from my Fleadom, oh yeah.

204
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,960
Damn!

205
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,730
The bleeding won't stop.

206
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,150
These fleas are more than just big bugs...

207
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,220
Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4.

208
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,090
Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1.

209
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,400
Okay.

210
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,140
The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.

211
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,670
The real goal is to exhaust my
strength through blood loss!

212
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,930
My fleas are very special...

213
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,430
They have a 200-meter vertical leap.

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,690
And when you factor in...

215
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,690
my air gun's power,

216
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,120
they become unstoppable, oh yeah.

217
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,150
Oh? He's already able to dodge them?

218
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,260
No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.

219
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,850
If I keep running around, it'll be
harder for them to snipe me!

220
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,890
But I have to conserve stamina.

221
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,590
Ah, he's going to try something.

222
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,830
He may try to use his power.

223
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,240
Let's see what he can do.

224
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay.

225
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,410
My Super Eye allows me to observe a target

226
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,710
from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.

227
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,430
No ability you use can escape my sight.

228
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,450
Now, let's see what you do.

229
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,520
Killua cannot use En.

230
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,280
Expanding his aura around him
and maintaining it for a long time

231
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,230
is by no means his forte.

232
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,520
Killua knows this shortcoming.

233
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,700
And so, he keeps his aura within
the range he can best manage.

234
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,360
A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.

235
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,340
Not much room to work with.

236
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,970
In other words, the moment a projectile is
within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,

237
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,500
Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes

238
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,060
and physical strength to react
with desperate speed,

239
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,760
and dodge at point-blank range.

240
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,860
But this time, he didn't dodge!

241
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,620
All to determine the angle of
the projectile's approach.

242
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,910
Damn... It came from this way!

243
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,880
He let himself be hit, so he
could locate the sniper.

244
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,310
The target is quickly heading your way.

245
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,390
Okay.

246
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:21,640
I somewhat expected this.

247
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,980
The bleeding's stopped anywhere
that the fleas only scratched me.

248
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,320
They must secrete some chemical that
stops blood from clotting naturally.

249
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,440
If I start bleeding in too many
places, I'll be in trouble.

250
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,910
I can't let him escape!

251
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,230
This is perfect.

252
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,240
I can see clearly in every direction.

253
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,130
How do you like this?

254
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,670
There's nowhere for you to hide!

255
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,670
Bring it on!

256
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,340
Wait!

257
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,060
This desert is massive.

258
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,100
If you don't have any water,
you'll die of thirst in a day.

259
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,350
Too bad...

260
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,390
I wanted to observe you a little longer,

261
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,170
but I guess that won't work.

262
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,960
I was running low on stamina, anyway.

263
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,480
I suppose this gives us more
time to talk things over...

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,060
Let's begin with introductions.

265
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,430
My name is Jail...
Scratch that, it's Meleoron.

266
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,020
When the Queen was still alive,
I was a Squadron Leader.

267
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,420
Nice to meet you.

268
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,690
What's your name?

269
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,940
Why were you following me?

270
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,100
Because I didn't want to let you get away.

271
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,450
And I certainly couldn't let you die...

272
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,450
Because you'll be a valuable partner.

273
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,860
You have business with the King, right?

274
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,870
I do not!

275
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,520
Huh?

276
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,960
That was dangerous...

277
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,710
He must have a reason for approaching me.

278
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,090
I can't tell him anything.

279
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,400
Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?

280
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,550
"You guys"?

281
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,720
Yep... I've been watching you since
that other kid was with you.

282
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,230
I understand.

283
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,440
And you felt that I would put up
less of a fight than Killua!

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,150
Huh? Eh?!

285
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,540
You've got it all wrong!

286
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,360
That's how you interpret it?

287
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,730
I guess it makes sense...

288
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,190
To you, I'd look like an enemy.

289
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,880
I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.

290
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,120
Listen up.

291
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,130
I swear that I'm not lying.

292
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,630
I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!

293
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,880
Okay, I believe you.

294
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,950
Of course... It's hard to believe!

295
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,520
I can sympathize.

296
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,550
If I were in your shoes...

297
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,270
Eh?

298
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,810
Is that him?

299
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,160
This is a trap.

300
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,510
You still wanna come?

301
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,730
Couldn't care less.

302
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,600
Die.

303
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,790
He instantly acted to kill me...

304
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,420
No hesitation at all.

305
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm impressed!

306
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,150
An underground lake?

307
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,360
Lookin' for a taste of hell?

308
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,080
Here you go!

309
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,250
Blood!

310
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,250
Food!

311
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,870
It's food!

312
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,620
Wait, this is...

313
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,550
Captain Ikalgo's host!

314
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,750
Crap, stop eating it.

315
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,640
I want to stop, but I can't...

316
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,260
The blood is calling to us!

317
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,010
Bastard!

318
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:34,270
How dare you chop off my precious legs?!

319
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,400
I couldn't let you drag me into the water.

320
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,650
These suction cups saved me.

321
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,780
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?

322
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,530
Don't call me an octopus!

323
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,660
Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,

324
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,950
a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling
an octopus, that uses human hosts.

325
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,920
Don't call me an octopus!

326
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,110
Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.

327
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,020
What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?

328
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,750
An octopus.

329
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,790
Don't call me an octopus!
