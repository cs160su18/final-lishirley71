00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,040
In the Dentora region

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,380
of the Republic of Padokea,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,950
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,300
Kukuroo Mountain.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,240
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,520
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,010
mansion that no one has ever seen before.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,830
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,010
Lamentation Tours

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,930
Well, how long will you be here?

12
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,680
Until we meet Killua!

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,350
We won't leave before then!

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,230
Then please come this way.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,440
The x Guard's x Duty

16
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,010
Gon and his friends have confronted

17
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,330
the obstacles that they must overcome

18
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,500
in order to meet with Killua.

19
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,430
What awaits them at their destination?

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,460
Here are the servants' quarters.

21
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,030
It's getting late.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,760
So you can stay here tonight.

23
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,300
Please come in.

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,420
Hey, I'm back!

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,070
Oh, you rarely bring guests.

26
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,820
This is Seaquant.

27
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,620
He works with me here.

28
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,150
Good evening.

29
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,500
If you managed to win over Zebro,
you must be special.

30
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,660
Well, make yourselves at home.

31
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,670
Though it won't be easy here.

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,350
You want to see young Killua?

33
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,720
That's a riot!

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,870
Sorry. But we're dead serious.

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,130
Then let me give you a warning:

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,230
Give up, and go home.

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,010
What was that?!

38
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,690
Zebro told you about the
Testing Gate, right?

39
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,230
That should give you an idea of
what this place is like.

40
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,570
We understand that it won't be easy.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,540
But I'm not leaving.

42
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,580
Not until I see Killua!

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,090
When Killua was in trouble,
I wasn't there for him.

44
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,400
If I had been there,

45
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,910
I could have stopped Killua!

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,650
Killua is my close friend!

47
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,500
We understand.

48
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,160
Then why not do some training here?

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,490
Training?

50
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,640
Hey, Zebro...

51
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,790
Listen to me, Gon-kun.

52
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,840
You three are allowed to work together

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,540
to open the door.

54
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,800
With a little training, it should be possible.

55
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,050
How about it?

56
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,900
I don't like the idea of being tested...

57
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,930
But if there is no other way...

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,730
We'll just have to do it!

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,150
Yep!

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,960
Then I'll need you to put these on.

61
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
How is this so heavy...

62
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,480
It weighs fifty kilograms.

63
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
Please wear it at all times,
except while you sleep.

64
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,620
I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.

65
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,870
Please have some tea.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,170
What the...?

67
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,370
The cups weigh twenty kilograms.

68
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,420
This teapot weighs forty kilograms.

69
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,380
All furniture and utensils in this house

70
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,860
weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.

71
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,040
I see... So this will serve as training.

72
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,440
It's useless.

73
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,780
They'll give up in two or three days.

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,760
What was that?

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,290
Seaquant, I believe that
your shift has already started.

76
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, that's right...

77
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,110
Sorry about that.

78
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,200
He isn't a bad person.

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,520
By the way, where's the bathroom?

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,590
Through the door over there.

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,220
I'm guessing that

82
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,090
the door is also...

83
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,350
Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms.

84
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,100
Five hundred?

85
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,470
What?! Get out!

86
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't hold it in!

87
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,640
Kalluto-chan, open the door.

88
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,530
Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?

89
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,000
It's no use, Mama.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,150
He isn't even the least bit sorry.

91
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
We need to make him suffer more.

92
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,570
Milluki! Shut your mouth!

93
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,540
Kil, stop being so stubborn
and say that you're sorry.

94
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh, right. That friend of yours...

95
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,170
Gon, was it?

96
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,420
He'd be better off just leaving,

97
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,510
but it sounds like he wants
to try the Testing Gate.

98
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,930
Gon is here...

99
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,630
Milluki! You're talking too much!

100
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,700
Listen to me, Kil...

101
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,460
You didn't even tell me?!

102
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,600
Don't yell at Mama!

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,360
I told you to shut your mouth!

104
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,920
I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil...

105
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,230
Since it's impossible for him
to open the front gate.

106
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,160
He'll do it.

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,740
What?

108
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,750
Gon will open it.

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,120
Oh, that's nice.

110
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,940
But he'll still never make it here...

111
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,010
Gon will...

112
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,340
He'll do it.

113
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,520
He will definitely make it here.

114
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,150
Wait, Gon!

115
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,920
You just watch.

116
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
Huh? Why?

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,430
You need to let your arm heal first.

118
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,660
As long as Kurapika and I can open it,
it doesn't matter.

119
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,120
Let us handle this!

120
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,170
Okay.

121
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,060
Let's do this, Kurapika!

122
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,150
Yeah!

123
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,550
It's impossible...

124
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,580
No use... It won't budge an inch.

125
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,060
Damn!

126
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,620
But we just started our training.

127
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,470
If we work hard enough, we can do it!

128
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,070
I wish I could share your optimism.

129
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,160
This will never work.

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,880
You kids need to wake up.

131
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,870
In that case,

132
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,680
you should quit watching us
and do your job!

133
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,590
Gon is one of us.

134
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,600
And he wishes to see his friend.

135
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,100
It's only right that we should help him.

136
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,470
Okay, let's give it another shot!

137
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,610
Yeah!

138
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,370
Man, you can't just mindlessly push.

139
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,080
Match your timing.

140
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,380
You have to push both doors,
with all your strength, simultaneously.

141
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,790
Or the gate won't ever open.

142
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,900
Match our timing...

143
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,900
And push both doors with all our
strength simultaneously...

144
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Okay!

145
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
One!

146
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,900
Two!

147
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Three!

148
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,540
Leorio! Kurapika!

149
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,290
It moved.

150
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:53,150
Hunter Vocabulary

151
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,150
Testing Gate

152
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,830
What?

153
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,110
The Testing Gate?

154
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,280
And?

155
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,680
Oh, well...

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,280
I just wanted to let you know.

157
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,790
Very well.

158
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,170
He's always so cold.

159
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,440
Hey, why don't you try removing
those vests today?

160
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh? Music to my ears!

161
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,380
Yeah!

162
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,760
Without them, we can
definitely open the gate now.

163
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's do this, Kurapika!

164
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah!

165
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,210
One... Two...

166
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,210
Three!

167
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,450
Damn it...

168
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,110
It won't move any farther.

169
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,730
One last spurt, Leorio...

170
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,490
Got it!

171
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
Gon...

172
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,350
Why are you using your left arm?

173
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,250
It's okay.

174
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
My arm's healed now.

175
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,370
Healed?

176
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,890
Are you sure, Gon?

177
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,010
Yep!

178
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,890
Anyway, we have to push together, right?

179
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,680
Right, let's push!

180
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,020
Here we go!

181
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,020
One!

182
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
Two!

183
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,270
Three!

184
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,540
It's opening...

185
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,610
Ow...

186
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,130
It opened.

187
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,900
Yes!

188
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,710
We did it, Gon!

189
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,760
Uh-huh!

190
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,980
Follow the path, and head for the mountain.

191
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,770
The mansion should be somewhere up there.

192
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,110
I'm ashamed to admit

193
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,810
that even though I've worked
here for twenty years,

194
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,630
I've never been up the mountain.

195
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,900
Sorry that I couldn't be any help.

196
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,660
No, that isn't true.

197
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,300
You've both been a huge help.

198
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,230
Thank you for everything!

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,410
Goodbye!

200
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,170
Those kids are really something.

201
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,140
They might be able to
make it to the mansion.

202
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,380
Won't happen. They'll just
get themselves killed.

203
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,180
Speaking from your experience
three years ago?

204
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,700
We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.

205
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,520
That made it painfully clear

206
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,200
that I wasn't on their level.

207
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,210
So you decided to work here.

208
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,680
Sorry...

209
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,870
But the masters and servants
are all monsters.

210
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,470
Once you step into their territory...

211
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,560
The Testing Gate opened?

212
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,060
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,500
This is a critical time for Killua.

214
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,440
We cannot allow anyone near him!

215
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,580
Especially not those unnecessary friends...

216
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,680
Do you understand?

217
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,160
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,250
Leave.

219
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,010
You're trespassing on private property.

220
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,320
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.

221
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,970
We called ahead.

222
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,760
And we came through the Testing Gate.

223
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,450
The butlers did not give you
permission to enter.

224
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,110
What do we need to do to get permission?

225
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,520
I said I was Killua's friend,
but they wouldn't put him on.

226
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,210
I wouldn't know.

227
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,070
Because no one has ever
received permission.

228
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,110
Then we'll have to trespass!

229
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,330
I suppose so.

230
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,460
In any case, this is where I draw the line.

231
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,060
If you take one step beyond this line,

232
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,540
I'll remove you by force.

233
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,770
Gon!

234
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,090
Damn it!

235
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,380
Leorio! Kurapika!

236
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,020
Don't interfere.

237
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,270
Let me handle this.

238
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,760
Ow...

239
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,960
We don't intend to fight you.

240
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,660
We just want to see Killua.

241
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,660
It doesn't matter what your motives are.

242
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm simply following my orders.

243
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,850
You can try all you want.

244
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,610
I'll never let you pass.

245
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,860
I will pass...

246
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm going to see Killua!

247
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,580
Welcome home,

248
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,460
Killua-sama.

249
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,730
Yeah.

250
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,640
I made...

251
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
a friend...

252
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,280
Stop it.

253
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,150
Stay away!

254
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,000
Cut it out!

255
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,740
Don't you realize how futile this is?!

256
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,110
Why don't you stop him?

257
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,710
Aren't you his friends?

258
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,720
What's the problem?

259
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,470
I'm just here to see my friend.

260
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,470
I'm just here to see Killua!

261
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,160
Why do I have to do this?!

262
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,380
Hey.

263
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,410
Huh?

264
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,990
I crossed the line.

265
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,740
Aren't you supposed to hit me?

266
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,370
You're different from Mike.

267
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,580
You may try to hide your feelings,

268
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,130
but you have a heart.

269
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,510
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.

270
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,830
Please...

271
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,810
Help Killua-sama—

272
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,610
Honestly...

273
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,500
What was that servant babbling about?

274
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,750
She made it sound like we're
being mean to Killua.

275
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,430
A worthless apprentice had
the nerve to insult us!

276
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,050
You must be Gon.

277
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,400
I heard about you from Illumi.

278
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,010
Killua knows that you're here.

279
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,140
I have a message for you from Kil...

280
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,730
"Thank you for coming.

281
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,870
I really appreciate it.

282
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,120
But I can't see you right now.

283
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,110
Sorry."

284
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,480
Gon and his friends have finally made it
inside the Zoldyck estate.

285
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,320
But now, they face their
greatest obstacle yet.

286
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,390
A sad message from Killua,

287
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,300
saying that he can't see them.

288
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,380
Next time: The x Zoldyck x Family!

289
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,770
What is Killua to you?

290
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,370
My big brother!
