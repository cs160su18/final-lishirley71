2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Once someone comes out,
follow their directions.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,220
It's been fun.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,200
Good luck.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,740
Yeah, thank you.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,270
Is this Mikhail's residence?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,000
Go do some shopping at
Dick Sakura, by the station.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,750
At check out, give the cashier this card.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,500
Please come this way, sir.

10
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,020
Strategy x And x Scheme

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,320
There are more people this time.

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,870
I wonder if there's anyone I know.

13
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,910
Yo.

14
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,550
Last year, you had your way with us.

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,980
But that won't happen again.

16
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,170
We've undergone some hellish training.

17
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,040
Our teamwork is perfect now.

18
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,800
Thank you for coming!

19
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,800
This year, 1,489 applicants
have made it this far,

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,060
but the Phase Two examiner has asked me
to trim that number to about 300.

21
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,760
As for the exam...

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,840
There are two hours before lunch.

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,690
Defeat five people before then.

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,950
Grab their tags when you defeat them,

25
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,200
and see me when you have all five.

26
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll wait on the other side of the door.

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,500
Got it?

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,580
As soon as I shut the door,

29
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
you may start.

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,840
Every stage of the exam should be like this...

31
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,630
You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.

32
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh, you're here!

33
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,620
Killu—

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,860
Sucks for you.

35
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm the only one passing this year.

36
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,820
He's totally out of our league...

37
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,120
So that's what it takes to
become a top Hunter...

38
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,640
This will be the last time I
attempt the Hunter Exam...

39
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,950
We finally have our first applicant.

40
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,160
That took an hour and a half.

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,680
What happened to everyone else?

42
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,330
They're all asleep.

43
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,910
It took me a while to collect all their tags.

44
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,300
Is there going to be a second stage?

45
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,390
That won't be necessary.

46
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,680
He's demonstrated his skill.

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,320
Killua, denizen of the darkness...

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,000
He's returned much stronger.

49
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,030
Applicant 1219, Killua-kun.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,960
Yeah.

51
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,460
You've passed

52
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,480
the Hunter Exam!

53
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,190
Welcome back, Killua.

54
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,370
How was the exam?

55
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,520
I passed it in no time, naturally.

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,440
Yay!

57
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,030
Sorry to interrupt your celebration,
but look at these spell cards.

58
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,040
Wow...

59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,990
There's even an S-rank card!

60
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,110
How much can we sell it for?

61
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,010
Oh, let's go ask around!

62
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,540
No, we should use it wisely.

63
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,740
So what should we do?

64
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,110
Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it.

65
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,190
With all these defensive spells,

66
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,300
we don't need to worry
about it getting stolen.

67
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,690
Have you tried any of these?

68
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,650
Just Blackout Curtain.

69
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,780
What?

70
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,930
If you have all these cards,
you should use them...

71
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,730
Start by using this one.

72
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,020
You can choose a player you've
met before, and talk to them.

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,020
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book.
(Connection maintained for
a maximum of 3 minutes.
May only be broken by
player who used this card.)
[LR][NORM]

74
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,090
Who should we talk to?

75
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,030
We won't know until we see who's available.

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,030
Contact on!

77
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,660
Oh, I see a lot of names.

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Hey, Gon...

79
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,560
When did you run into him?

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,450
Huh?

81
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,010
Chrollo Lucilfer

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,570
Chrollo?

83
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,120
Who's Chrollo?

84
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,210
I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.

85
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,050
Does that mean you guys passed
each other without noticing?

86
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,640
Huh? What are you talking about?

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,260
That doesn't make sense.

88
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,020
Kurapika sealed his Nen.

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,900
Yeah, and you have to use
Nen to enter the game.

90
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,620
Who's Kurapika?!

91
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,320
That only leaves...

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,630
Let me in on this!

93
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,330
I get it. So that's what's going on.

94
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,250
Hey, Shal...

95
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,430
Stop laughing, and explain
what this is about.

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,830
Sorry about that.

97
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,710
Chrollo Lucilfer

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,710
This probably isn't the boss.

99
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,840
He hasn't purged the Nen from his body.

100
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,200
Purging Nen?

101
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,090
It's very doable.

102
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,050
Seriously?

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,170
Of course!

104
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,960
If you can place Nen on others,

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,350
it's not unreasonable to think
Nen can be removed, as well.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,100
Does that mean Chrollo has removed
Kurapika's Nen, and entered the game?

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,860
Why would he be here?

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm not sure,

109
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,670
but we should probably let Kurapika know.

110
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll leave the game real quick.

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,740
You can use a spell card to leave.

112
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,800
Save it.

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,440
I can be out and back in four hours.

114
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,240
I should have realized this sooner...

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Yorknew City                                        Greed Island

116
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,000
This island is directly east of Yorknew City.

117
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,340
East is the direction to go.

118
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,190
You will find one who awaits you.

119
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,800
I see.

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
So the boss came here to find
someone to purge that Nen.

121
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,760
The boss arrived the same way we did,

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,260
but then Razor kicked him out.

123
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,790
That was when he realized
this was Greed Island.

124
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,840
But since the boss can't use Nen,

125
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
he can't enter the island
via the usual channels.

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,160
So he must have hired someone
to come to this island for him.

127
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,750
He had them use his name
as a hidden message to us.

128
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,010
The one who can purge this
Nen is on Greed Island.

129
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,550
Change in plans again...

130
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,860
Let's bring everyone else here.

131
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,290
Yes, we'll all start looking
for this Nen exorcist.

132
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,170
I have a small correction.

133
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,990
You're...

134
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,900
Hisoka!

135
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,640
It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.

136
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,690
Because I didn't know you could
enter any name you like

137
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,710
until I was already inside...

138
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,390
You should praise my initiative.

139
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,580
Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.

140
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,010
Ah, so that's what this is about.

141
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,330
I'm dying to kill you right here and now,

142
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,260
but I'll let the boss do that.

143
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,550
Well, if anything comes up,
use Contact to get in touch.

144
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,020
If I learn anything new, I'll let you know.

145
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,280
Bye.

146
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,230
So the boss hired Hisoka...

147
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,820
He probably didn't have much
choice, but it's still weird.

148
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,060
And his reward is probably a duel,
once the boss is cleansed.

149
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,150
But now, it's only a matter of time

150
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,810
until the boss comes back!

151
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,910
I doubt it.

152
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,700
I would know at once

153
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,660
if Nen I placed on a spider
had been removed.

154
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,370
So when you chose your power, you
knew something like this might happen?

155
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,810
Of course...

156
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,230
If you're able to place Nen on others,

157
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,350
it only makes sense to assume

158
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,810
that one can also remove Nen.

159
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,500
Well, now you know.

160
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,060
What you do from here is up to you.

161
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,010
Thanks for taking the trouble.

162
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,340
You have my gratitude.

163
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,740
Did you need anything?

164
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,690
What am I...

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,430
What am I supposed to do this month?

166
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,570
Tell me...

167
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,950
What should I do?

168
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,150
It'll be fine. Let me handle...

169
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,710
What could you possibly know?

170
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,990
You have no idea what's going
to happen to us now!

171
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,990
Neon... I need Neon!

172
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,800
Restore Neon at once!

173
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,020
Damn! Why did this happen?

174
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,870
I wonder what's wrong...

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,000
Why did it stop working?

176
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,990
See ya.

177
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,430
Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.

178
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,500
Oh...

179
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,380
Kurapika was pretty calm about it.

180
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,460
Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.

181
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,010
Well, it sounds like you
got worried for nothing.

182
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,260
Now it's time to focus on yourselves.

183
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,300
Osu!

184
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Start with the basics...

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
We're not going to train.

186
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,650
It's time to start

187
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,530
beating this game!

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,150
It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle

189
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,080
lives only on this tree!

190
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,120
There's only one way to capture it!

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,450
Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.

192
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,370
First comes rock!

193
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,160
Rock, paper...

194
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,770
Rock!

195
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,840
Wow!

196
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,630
It's raining bugs!

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,270
Found it.

198
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,370
Difficulty rank A!

199
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,140
King Great White Beetle
A legendary insect that
releases pheromones
which attract other insects
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony
for brief evening walks.

200
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,040
That's three King Great White Beetle cards!

201
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,270
You could've gotten more if
you'd thrown a real punch.

202
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,990
Well, I didn't want to damage the tree.

203
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,280
There is no such girl in this mansion.

204
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,930
Even if there were, it would be impossible

205
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,830
for you to bypass all the traps and find her.

206
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,280
Found her.

207
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,140
She was in a hidden room,
four floors underground.

208
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,910
What?

209
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,540
Curse you!

210
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,170
Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!

211
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,790
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
Very shy and quiet.

212
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,050
The guard was a rank F.

213
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,640
Next, let's head to the
City of Gambling, Dorias!

214
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,440
Wait, wasn't today supposed to be

215
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
the monthly contest in Antokiba?

216
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,560
We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go.

217
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,560
Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.

218
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,560
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

219
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,560
A Paladin's Necklace! Score!

220
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,850
I don't understand this description.

221
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,820
We can ask one of the shopkeepers.

222
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,430
When you wear this necklace,

223
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,950
you can reflect all attack spells.

224
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,550
And if you touch cards under the

225
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,930
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]

226
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,960
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]

227
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,960
effects of Transform or Fake,

228
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,340
you can restore them to their original state.

229
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,990
Wow...

230
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,300
If we wear this, we won't have to
worry about losing any cards.

231
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,990
Memory Helmet...

232
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,070
Memory Helmet
A player will always remember
everything seen or heard
while wearing this item.
Unfortunately, helmet is
very large and heavy.

233
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,370
Witch's Love Potion.

234
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,570
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.

235
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,010
Risky Dice.

236
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,200
Risky Dice
A 20-sided die. One side says
Bad Luck, while the other nineteen
say Good Luck. If player rolls
Good Luck, something good will
happen. But if player rolls Bad Luck,
something bad will happen to cancel
out everything that was good.

237
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,130
King Great White Beetle.

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,240
King Great White Beetle
A legendary insect that
releases pheromones
which attract other insects
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony
for brief evening walks.

239
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,660
Gold Dust Girl.

240
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,330
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
Very shy and quiet.

241
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,230
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

242
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,230
Paladin's Necklace.

243
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,400
A total of six different restricted slot cards!

244
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,890
Piece of cake!

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
Piece of cake?

246
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,980
Not in the least.

247
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,520
This was only possible because you
underwent that grueling training.

248
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,990
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

249
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Yo. It's been a while, Gon.

250
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,720
Who are you?

251
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,320
You don't remember me?

252
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you remember the player

253
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,990
who took the Sword of Truth
from you in Antokiba?

254
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,010
What do you want?

255
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,500
Up for a trade?

256
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,810
I have #66, Witch's Diet Pill,
and #17, VIP Multi-Pass.

257
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,430
You can talk it over with your friends.

258
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,070
What do you think?

259
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,700
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

260
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,470
It's Tsezgerra.

261
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,630
You again?

262
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,780
Interested in trading your

263
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,730
Breath of Archangel for our Patch of Forest?

264
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,210
It's an SS-rank card.

265
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,680
No way.

266
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,870
I've already said I won't
deal with you people.

267
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,020
What if I throw in a Clone?

268
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm telling you that there's no deal here.

269
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,030
You already have ninety-two different cards.

270
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,930
All that's left

271
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,890
are the cards monopolized
by other players, yes?

272
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,140
Actually, we have ninety-five...

273
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,110
And you probably have many items
that you haven't used Gain on yet.

274
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,490
It's possible that Breath of Archangel
is the final card you need.

275
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,440
If we give that to you, we'll lose.

276
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,870
Stop playing dumb.

277
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,010
I know that you're monopolizing

278
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,130
both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade.

279
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,290
This game isn't over yet.

280
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,130
I see.

281
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,480
Good luck, then.

282
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,420
But we'll never let you have these cards.

283
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,390
What if I offer three cards?

284
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,110
We'll give you Patch of Forest,

285
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,670
Patch of Forest
The entrance to an enormous
forest known as the Mountain
God's Garden. Many species
exist only in this forest.
All are friendly to humans.

286
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,420
Hidden Hollow
Upon entering and exiting hollow,
player will be transported to a
desolate location. However, player can
return to original location
without spending any money.

287
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,870
Hidden Hollow,

288
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,270
Palmtop Dragon
As the name implies, this dragon
fits on your palm. Willingly obeys
its master. If raised lovingly,
it can learn to speak.

289
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,270
and Palmtop Dragon.

290
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,280
And you only have to give us Night Jade,
not Breath of Archangel.

291
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,430
We'd be giving you one SS-rank
card and two S-rank cards,

292
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,750
while you'd only give up one A-rank card.

293
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,790
I believe this deal is too good to pass up.

294
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,890
Give us some time to discuss this.

295
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,370
Just to be clear, this is our final offer.

296
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,110
We won't accept any further negotiation.

297
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,500
Book.

298
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,510
It's gotta be a trap.

299
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,190
That offer's too good.

300
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,620
Tsezgerra is a careful man.

301
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,680
He wouldn't try to pick a fight.

302
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,610
But at the same time, he would
never make a losing deal.

303
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,190
Breath of Archangel
An angel who can cure any mortal
injury or terminal disease with one breath.
However, angel will appear only once.

304
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,930
Meaning that he thinks

305
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,190
he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.

306
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,110
Does that mean they've assembled
all forty spell card types?

307
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,500
It's possible.

308
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,200
So they're waiting for Gain to be
used on a Breath of Archangel.

309
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,710
Night Jade
A jewel blessed by the devil.
When the holder is in danger,
peril will be shifted to another.

310
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,050
On the other hand, Night Jade is a card

311
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,660
that we monopolized through hard work.

312
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,500
If one of the cards were to be destroyed,

313
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,960
one of our jade jewels would
automatically turn into a card.

314
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,080
Which means the A-rank
Night Jade is much harder

315
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,220
for them to get than the
SS-rank Breath of Archangel.

316
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,150
This is a gamble.

317
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,730
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.

318
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,730
VIP Multi-Pass
Present this pass to gain
entry into any location.
Contains 1000 passes.

319
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,590
Book.

320
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,620
See ya.

321
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,430
That was uneventful.

322
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,180
Kind of disappointing.

323
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,100
I was so nervous...

324
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,250
But now we've gathered
seven types, in three days!

325
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,450
We're making decent progress.

326
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,930
Okay, let's keep this up.

327
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,920
Are there any other events in the city
for getting restricted slot cards?

328
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,260
Hmm... I think there are...

329
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,090
Prizes from the slot machines?

330
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,020
Should've expected as much from
Dorias, the City of Gambling.

331
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,200
You have a 0.01% chance of winning.

332
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,000
That's one in ten thousand tries.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,540
So it all comes down to luck.

334
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,230
Pretty risky.

335
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,740
I know, Gon!

336
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,660
Use that dice!

337
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,260
This is it...

338
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,160
If we get Good Luck, we can win!

339
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,420
But if you get Bad Luck,

340
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,740
something bad will happen that cancels out

341
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,300
everything good that's happened.

342
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,170
There's only a one in twenty
chance of getting Bad Luck.

343
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,470
There!

344
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,550
Next, we try the slot machine!

345
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,010
Awesome! One try!

346
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,390
Rainbow Diamond
A diamond that glitters like
a rainbow. If this diamond
is presented when proposing,
you will never be turned down.

347
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,390
A Rainbow Diamond! Score!

348
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,260
That's what I thought...

349
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,640
This die is the key to winning in this city.

350
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,950
But if you roll Bad Luck, it could be scary.

351
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,520
Don't worry.

352
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,180
It can't kill me...

353
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!

354
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,220
I knew something was wrong.

355
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,910
That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row.

356
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,400
And he was acting weird...

357
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,310
He kept rolling a funny-looking die.

358
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,290
Yikes, his face is mush...

359
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,300
Anyway, let's make the trade.

360
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,090
Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S
and above as quickly as possible.

361
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,890
Yeah.

362
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,060
As for cards rank A and below...

363
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,080
Roll.

364
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,310
S-Spare me...

365
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,040
This is only your third time.

366
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,190
You'll be fine.

367
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,220
I-I know someone who got
Bad Luck on the first roll and died!

368
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,930
If I roll Bad Luck,

369
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,860
I'll be hit for every Good Luck
that the other players rolled!

370
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,120
Not my problem.

371
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,330
Roll.

372
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,150
Or would you rather die right now?

373
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,680
Come on...

374
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,840
See?

375
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,270
It's pretty rare to get Bad Luck.

376
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,020
Now we use the Lottery card.

377
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,690
We want #75, Lucky Alexandrite.

378
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,280
If you obtain one, we'll set you free.

379
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,240
C-Come on...

380
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,630
Lottery on!

381
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,940
Well?

382
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,430
#76!

383
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,270
So close!

384
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,270
Your luck sucks.

385
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,020
Okay, one more time!

386
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,770
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

387
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,980
Time for Motarike-kun to
show us what he's got!

388
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,440
No good, huh?

389
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,700
Hey, Gen.

390
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,930
Should we make the first move?

391
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,520
I already told you that combat
should be our last resort.

392
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,440
It's too early for that.

393
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,940
No, we're trying to stay
one step ahead of them.

394
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,530
Though, once we commit,

395
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,190
further negotiation will be impossible.

396
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,200
What do you have in mind?

397
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,950
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)

398
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,820
We use Tax Collector's Gauntlet,

399
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,950
combined with Risky Dice.

400
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,380
I understand.

401
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,990
We use this to steal eight cards
from them immediately...

402
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,460
But it's definitely dangerous.

403
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,870
If someone rolls Bad Luck, they'll probably die.

404
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,030
But this job is too important to leave to them.

405
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,470
We can do this!

406
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,430
We've come this far.
Let's clear the game.

407
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,730
Hey, Gen...

408
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,460
What are you up to?

409
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,260
I've told you this many times.

410
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,630
When taking a risk, we three share the danger.

411
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,030
It's Tsezgerra.

412
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,370
Have you reached a decision?

413
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,860
Okay, you have a deal.

414
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,890
I can do this...

415
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,470
One more time!

416
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,270
I said I can do this,

417
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,690
so I'm gonna do it!

418
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,350
Okay, let's move on to the next city!

419
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Gon's team has begun
working to beat the game.

420
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,470
The story is nearing its climax.

421
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,260
G.I. Tutorial

422
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

423
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,390
Today, we introduce the card Lottery.

424
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:18,870
Lottery
Change this card
into a random item card.
[SR][NORM]

425
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,370
When you use this card,
it changes into a random card.

426
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,360
That's why it's effective to use with Risky Dice.

427
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

428
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,880
Next time: 15 X 15.

429
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,130
Hey, Killua, is this fifteen?

430
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,470
What did you think it was?

431
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,810
One five.

432
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,400
Cute, huh...
