2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,050
Gon-kun!

10
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,300
Where is everyone?

11
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,010
You need more rest, Gon-kun...

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,650
Some x Brother x Trouble

13
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,650
After Gon learned why Killua
had been disqualified,

14
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,660
he was furious with Gittarackur...

15
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,510
Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi.

16
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,810
Apologize to Killua!

17
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,550
Apologize? For what?

18
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,310
You don't know what you did wrong?

19
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,450
Nope.

20
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,370
You don't have the right to be his brother.

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,700
Must I earn the right to be his brother?

22
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,710
He doesn't need to earn the
right to be my friend!

23
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,350
This boy is...

24
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,370
Don't bother apologizing.

25
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,860
Just take me to see Killua.

26
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,810
What will you do then?

27
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,460
That should be obvious...

28
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm gonna rescue Killua!

29
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,990
You make it sound as
though I kidnapped him...

30
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,200
He walked away on his own.

31
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,270
But it wasn't by choice.

32
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,010
He was being manipulated by you people.

33
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,990
It's the same thing as kidnapping him!

34
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,520
We happened to be discussing
this very subject, Gon.

35
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,030
Kurapika and Leorio have both
lodged complaints.

36
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,090
The committee has been discussing

37
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,870
the fairness of Killua's disqualification.

38
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,290
Killua had been behaving

39
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,420
in a strange manner during and
since his battle with the man

40
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,040
who called himself Gittarackur!

41
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:38,040
I believe that he was hypnotized
into committing murder.

42
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,880
Under normal circumstances,

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,800
it would be impossible to use
hypnosis to induce a person to kill.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,240
However, as Killua was raised
in a family of assassins,

45
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,170
murder was a part of his daily life,

46
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,310
so it's natural that he would lack
the ethical restraint of most!

47
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,790
I want to mention

48
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,060
that the attack happened during the
match between Bodoro and me.

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,180
It's possible that he was trying to help me.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,530
Given that, the one who should be disqualified

51
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,780
is me.

52
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,850
In any case,

53
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,790
Killua was not in control of his own actions.

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,040
Thus, he should not have been disqualified!

55
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,930
That is mere speculation.

56
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,800
There is no proof.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,280
There were no clear signs of manipulation.

58
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,310
In fact, I would question

59
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,060
the claim that he was hypnotized.

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,400
I agree that the incident occurred after

61
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,190
the battle between Leorio
and Bodoro had begun.

62
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,980
At that point, both fighters
were evenly matched.

63
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,280
Bodoro had more experience.

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,960
But in terms of raw combat ability,
Leorio was the stronger.

65
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,890
There was no need for Killua to interfere.

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
There was some other funny
business happening.

67
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,840
Like when you fought Hisoka.

68
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,470
Back then,

69
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,470
what did he say to you?

70
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,480
Neither of you seemed particularly tired.

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,930
But Hisoka whispered something in your ear,

72
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,230
right before conceding.

73
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,230
That's pretty strange.

74
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,930
I'd understand surrendering after your
opponent whispers something to you,

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,700
as happened with Hanzo and me,
or Bodoro and Hisoka.

76
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,740
Because we were under
considerable pressure.

77
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,560
But in your case, the exact opposite happened.

78
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,520
I have to wonder if you struck
some sort of bargain.

79
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,210
If you're going to question
anything that seems odd,

80
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,010
your own victory was quite odd, indeed.

81
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,010
If you have nothing to hide,
you should tell us what he said.

82
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,270
Right now.

83
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,660
I have no obligation to tell you.

84
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,610
Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us.

85
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,220
Not really.

86
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,400
If you consider my victory to be odd,

87
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,960
a victory by default would be equally odd.

88
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,410
What?!

89
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,580
None of that matters...

90
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,790
Come on...

91
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,790
I want to get this lecture
over with so I can leave.

92
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,920
Hey, now...

93
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,680
None of that matters!

94
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,560
It's pointless to argue over whether
someone should have passed.

95
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
If you aren't happy about passing,

96
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,810
keep working until you're satisfied.

97
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,320
If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam,
he'll definitely pass!

98
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,660
It's unfortunate that he failed this time,
but it is what it is.

99
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,330
What does matter...

100
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,580
If you've been forcing Killua to kill,
against his will, all this time,

101
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,040
I'll make you pay!

102
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,490
Make me pay?

103
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,150
What, exactly, will you do?

104
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,030
I won't do anything.

105
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,510
Only, once I rescue Killua,
I'll never let you see him again!

106
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,110
Ahem.

107
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,620
Is everyone finished?

108
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,950
Gon is absolutely correct.

109
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,120
You must decide for yourselves
if you were worthy of passing.

110
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,370
You may complain about
the results all you like,

111
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,880
but we will not be changing our minds.

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,130
Killua has been disqualified.

113
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,140
And the rest of you have passed the exam.

114
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,150
Okay, then I shall continue the orientation.

115
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,650
The cards I've passed out
are your Hunter Licenses.

116
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,480
This card allows you

117
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,530
to enter 90% of the countries
that limit immigration,

118
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,670
as well as 75% of the restricted
areas in the world.

119
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,420
Crazy...

120
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,130
This card also provides free access
to 95% of public facilities,

121
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,530
and a line of credit that rivals
large corporations.

122
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,930
If you sell the card, you'll have enough
money to last seven lifetimes.

123
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,230
And if you keep it, you'll still
be living in comfort.

124
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,440
So take extra care that your
license isn't lost or stolen.

125
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,610
You won't receive a replacement.

126
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,470
According to our estimates,
one in five Hunters

127
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,060
lose their card within a year of receiving it.

128
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,090
As a Hunter, your first challenge
is to protect your card.

129
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,090
The rest is up to you.

130
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,090
Rise above challenges,
believe in your own strength,

131
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,360
and fulfill your dreams.

132
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,600
Then,

133
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,600
we now declare the seven members
here to be new Hunters!

134
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:43,200
Hunter Vocabulary

135
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,200
License

136
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,970
Gittarackur...

137
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,470
Tell me where Killua is.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,990
Are you really going to take him away?

139
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,480
I think that's a bad idea.

140
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,230
I don't care what you think!

141
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,090
Killua is my friend.

142
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,730
I'm taking him with me.

143
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,840
Do they feel the same way?

144
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,500
You bet.

145
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,240
Fine.

146
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,540
I doubt you'll be able to
make it there anyway.

147
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,500
Killua went home.

148
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Home?

149
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,640
Kukuroo Mountain.

150
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,510
Our family lives at the very top.

151
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,670
Kukuroo Mountain?

152
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,500
Got it. Thanks.

153
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,750
Is it really okay

154
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,770
for an assassin to give away
his base of operations?

155
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,330
Sure, it isn't a secret or anything.

156
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,270
The locals all know where we live.

157
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,750
Well, I'm sure they'll see the
light once they arrive.

158
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,010
We live in completely different worlds...

159
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, this?

160
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,040
Yep, it's broken.

161
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,970
He has incredible potential.

162
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,550
I can understand why you want
to see him grow up.

163
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,300
Didn't I tell you?

164
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,240
But that makes him all the more dangerous.

165
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,750
This would be the best chance to...

166
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,640
Gon is my prey.

167
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,860
Touch him, and you'll suffer
the consequences.

168
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,240
I know.

169
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,490
I've only known you for a short while,
but I know your tastes.

170
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,300
So, Hisoka.

171
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,250
What are you going to do now?

172
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,490
Wait patiently.

173
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,820
For the fruit to ripen...

174
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,400
Kukuroo Mountain?

175
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,770
Never heard of it before.

176
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,340
Kurapika, do you know where it is?

177
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Hey, Kurapika!

178
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,270
Huh?

179
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,040
Oh, what is it?

180
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,390
The mountain!

181
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,920
He said something about Kukuroo Mountain.

182
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,780
Do you know where it might be?

183
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,270
No, I don't...

184
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,310
We can look it up online.

185
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,530
Yo!

186
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,540
Oh, Hanzo-san!

187
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm going back to my country.

188
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,430
It was a short, yet seemingly long
acquaintance, but I had fun.

189
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,800
So did I.

190
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,290
If you ever visit my country, let me know.

191
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,320
I can show you the best tourist spots!

192
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,980
See ya!

193
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,950
Bye!

194
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,810
Cloud-Hidden Ninja
Hanzo

195
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,500
A shinobi who tries to leave an impression...

196
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,170
Hey.

197
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,700
Sorry about getting so excited back there.

198
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,520
No, I also lost control.

199
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,810
Forgive me.

200
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,580
No, I only got mad because you were right.

201
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,590
I was using you to take out my
frustration for winning by default.

202
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,730
But I'm over that now.

203
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,340
Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!

204
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,570
The question is what to do next.

205
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,350
Yes, you're right.

206
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,580
I'm going to travel the world,
gathering information

207
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,860
and discovering new species,
as an Exotic Game Hunter.

208
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,960
An Exotic Game Hunter...

209
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,980
Hey, what's that?

210
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,080
Oh, this?

211
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,120
You can use this to obtain
all kinds of information.

212
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,400
Is there anything you'd like to know?

213
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,040
I can look it up on the spot.

214
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Oh...

215
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,780
Can you look up a Hunter named Ging?

216
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,630
Ging Freecss.

217
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,630
Sure, hold on...

218
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,370
Satotz?

219
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,420
Hey, who is this Ging guy?

220
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,140
Huh?

221
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,550
All information related to him is behind

222
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,400
a tight security system that

223
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,900
requires a bunch of different accesses.

224
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,550
He has some serious influence,
even at the national level.

225
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,400
Huh? Really?

226
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,910
Forget it, then...

227
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,820
Looks like your dad is someone really special.

228
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,060
Okay, let me know if anything comes up.

229
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,660
This is my e-mail address.

230
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,360
Bye.

231
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,450
Bye!

232
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,090
We should have asked him to
look up Kukuroo Mountain.

233
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,310
That's right.

234
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,540
It's okay.

235
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,620
As Chairman Netero was saying,
we are all Hunters now.

236
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,730
It's a bad idea to let other Hunters
know what you're doing.

237
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,670
We can look it up ourselves.

238
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,820
Gon-kun.

239
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,130
Satotz-san!

240
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,230
Gon-kun, you forgot this.

241
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,070
Oh, right...

242
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,130
Thanks!

243
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,960
And do you have a moment?

244
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,060
We'll be waiting in the lobby.

245
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,820
Okay!

246
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,140
Forgive me, but I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

247
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,460
I happen to specialize in the
discovery, restoration,

248
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,470
and preservation of ancient ruins.

249
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,790
When I first began,

250
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,480
I was only focused on the glory
derived from new discoveries.

251
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,660
But after watching a certain Hunter at work,

252
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,030
I came to feel ashamed.

253
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,980
That Hunter would discover ruins,

254
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,120
spend his own money to
completely restore them,

255
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,020
and take steps to preserve the
ruins for future generations,

256
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,860
thus ensuring that ordinary people
would have a chance to see them.

257
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,630
I was more impressed by
his dedication to his job

258
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,540
than by the beauty of the ruins.

259
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,840
The work he did to preserve those ruins

260
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,150
has been documented in manuals
used around the world.

261
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,660
And this Hunter, Gon-kun,

262
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,820
was Ging Freecss, the man
you were asking about.

263
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,320
I wished to meet him,

264
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,920
so I did some investigating.

265
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,700
However, quite frankly, he is an enigma.

266
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,930
I wasn't able to learn anything about him...

267
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,280
Really? Figures.

268
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,940
My goal is to become a Hunter like him.

269
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,410
My dream is to thank him in person one day.

270
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,770
Uh-huh.

271
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,790
That's all I had to say.

272
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,030
Sorry for interrupting you.

273
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,420
It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san.

274
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,160
Bye!

275
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,700
Oh...

276
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,110
Gon-kun.

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,710
Hmm?

278
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,890
Oh, never mind...

279
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,210
Take care of yourself.

280
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,350
Yeah. You, too.

281
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,720
Bye!

282
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,310
First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain.

283
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,020
Yeah.

284
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,280
Kukuroo Mountain...

285
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,990
There it is.

286
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,530
"Kukuroo Mountain.

287
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,370
A 3,722 meter-high mountain,

288
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,990
in the Dentora region of
the Republic of Padokea."

289
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,330
The Republic of Padokea?

290
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,740
Never heard of it.

291
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,020
Where is it?

292
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,250
Hold on.

293
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,760
I'll bring up a map.

294
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,010
This is the Republic of Padokea.

295
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,440
It should be fine.
It appears to be a stable country.

296
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,010
It allows ordinary tourists.

297
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,330
That's where we'll find Killua?

298
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,230
By airship, it will take three days to reach...

299
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,690
When do we leave?

300
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,980
Today! Right now!

301
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
Yeah, no objection from me!

302
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,970
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.

303
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,950
What's going on?

304
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,760
We've been stuck in one place forever.

305
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,100
This won't do.

306
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,620
We'll be late for our flight.

307
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,020
Pops! Do something!

308
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,100
I'm afraid I can't help this traffic.

309
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,800
And this is the only road.

310
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,720
In that case...

311
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,580
Yahoo!

312
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,110
Hey, Gon!

313
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,610
Do you realize how far away the airport is?

314
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,700
I want to rescue Killua as soon
as humanly possible!

315
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Fine, you win.

316
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,130
This reminds me of the Hunter Exam.

317
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,880
That's right.

318
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,800
This is nothing compared
to the Hunter Exam.

319
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,390
Yeah...

320
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,980
You got that right.

321
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,790
Okay...

322
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,570
Race you to the airport!

323
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,150
Ready...

324
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
Go!

325
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,460
Gon and his friends set off for
the Republic of Padokea.

326
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,890
Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua's home is located.

327
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,140
Satotz.

328
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,490
Menchi. Buhara.

329
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,360
Hey, Satotz...

330
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,160
That was a close call.

331
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,070
You were watching?

332
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,500
That boy is a mystery...

333
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,440
I find myself wanting to help him.

334
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,660
I almost let the cat out of the bag.

335
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,440
About how the real Hunter Exam

336
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,500
hasn't ended yet.

337
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,680
Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!

338
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,150
Fetch, doggie!

339
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,810
That's it...

340
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,170
Roll over, doggie!

341
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,600
Oh, yeah!
