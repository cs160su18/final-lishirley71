2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,120
I must crush his will.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,970
His will to fight, his will to stand,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,440
his will to resist...

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:19,710
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!

6
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,040
Victor x And x Loser

7
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,640
He's fast...

8
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,390
I had no time to dodge!

9
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,670
But I can still block his attacks!

10
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,690
Oh? He used Gyo?

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,600
The moment I grasped his arm,

12
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,450
he focused his aura there to block my attack.

13
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,050
Idiot!

14
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,080
You think you've outwitted me now?!

15
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,920
What's the matter?

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,970
That was just a body blow.

17
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,170
If you focus your aura where I grab you,

18
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,970
you leave yourself open everywhere else.

19
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,300
It's futile...

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,250
In fact, you're only making
it harder on yourself.

21
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,110
Bisky was right!

22
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,740
You won't be smiling much longer!

23
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,400
One more hit to send you to hell!

24
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,490
Impossible!

25
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,180
That was the hardest hit so far!

26
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,920
He shouldn't have been able to counter.

27
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,680
But since he did, that means he
kept the damage to a minimum.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,730
In other words, he blocked me
without relying on aura.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,250
He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?

30
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,770
No, that wasn't a guess.

31
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,490
Hey, Bisky...

32
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,030
How does Genthru avoid being
burned by his own bombs?

33
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,580
That's quite simple.

34
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,700
He shrouds his hand in aura that's
stronger than the explosion.

35
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,290
Oh... I get it.

36
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,290
It's a technique that requires
a large aura reserve.

37
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,530
This is a good opportunity.

38
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,300
By now, you should be able to tell.

39
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,600
Excellent reaction!

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,790
You've almost perfected Gyo.

41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,560
One more time, then.

42
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,760
Huh?

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,250
Could you tell the difference?

44
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah, you used less aura the second time.

45
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,330
Okay, you pass.

46
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,820
You'll have an easier time with him
if you can tell the difference.

47
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,130
When Genthru prepares Little Flower,
he will shroud his hand with Gyo.

48
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,780
If he's just faking and planning
to attack you somewhere else,

49
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,970
he probably won't use Gyo.

50
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,050
If you can tell if his hand is covered
with Gyo when he grabs you,

51
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,840
it'll be simpler for you to know
which attack you should block.

52
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,220
So that's it.

53
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,560
You knew from my Gyo.

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,850
Cunning.

55
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,350
Let me repeat myself.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,640
The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.

57
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,450
If you're caught by Little Flower when
you aren't using enough aura to defend,

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,870
a hit to the face will blow off your eyes,
nose, and mouth with no hope of repair.

59
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,760
A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin,
severely damaging any nerves or muscle.

60
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,780
You'll have no fingers or toes left.

61
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,510
It's not possible for you to use Gyo to guard
against every attack that uses Gyo.

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,130
Now what?

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,850
I'm not interested in continuing this.

64
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,270
Fighting you has made me see something...

65
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,810
You have talent and a promising future.

66
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,520
And many other chances.

67
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't you think it's meaningless to throw
all that away just for your pride?

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,530
Just give up, stupid kid!

69
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,830
If he makes like he's going to use
both hands to blow you up,

70
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,390
that's a red light.

71
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,410
Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.

72
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,920
Sorry, Bisky and Killua.

73
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,140
I'm gonna be selfish here.

74
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,280
I have to give it a try...

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,490
Because I just had a great idea!

76
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,430
If you seriously mean that,

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,810
you should surrender, Genthru!

78
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,720
A shame...

79
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,820
Let me show you

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,240
that there are some things worse than death.

81
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,280
I'll blow up both your arms.

82
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,260
Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.

83
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,580
After that, I'll blow up your
remaining arm and left leg.

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,020
Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.

85
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,590
And so on...

86
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,980
Until you're out of limbs.

87
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,930
Go ahead and try!

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,520
Very well.

89
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,180
Take this!

90
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,510
Wh-What happened?

91
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,490
Blood?

92
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,390
Damage?

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,680
He landed a hit?

94
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,930
First comes rock!

95
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,880
Crap...

96
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,260
Move... Dodge!

97
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,380
Rock...

98
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,880
Paper...

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,210
Rock!

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Did he hit me?

101
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,950
No, I tripped.

102
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,030
What was that?

103
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,460
What just happened?

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,780
Now I understand...

105
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,870
Th-This kid...

106
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,180
He sacrificed both hands!

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,830
But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!

108
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,820
He probably gave up completely on his left hand,

109
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,860
protected his right hand with 30% of his aura,

110
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,520
and focused the remaining 70% on his legs...

111
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,030
to attack me!

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,900
I use aura both to explode targets and
to shield my hand from the blast.

113
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,000
If I use it on both hands,

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,080
I won't have much left for the rest of myself.

115
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,490
He took advantage of that!

116
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,120
Still, no one sane would actually try that!

117
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,130
I gave him a pretty good scare!

118
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,940
Damn...

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,030
This hurts like hell.

120
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,480
But...

121
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,630
I'm going for it!

122
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,630
I'm done...

123
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,800
He's done?

124
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,890
Is he giving up?

125
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,950
Of course...

126
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,640
That makes sense.

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,720
He's lost his left hand,
and his right is badly injured.

128
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,050
And he managed to land a hit on me.

129
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,520
He must be satisfied now.

130
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,030
I'm done being selfish...

131
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,900
Time to get serious!

132
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,780
Let's do this, Genthru!

133
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,290
Th-This kid's

134
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,620
totally insane!

135
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,440
Book!

136
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,320
A card?

137
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,860
He shouldn't have anything to concern me.

138
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,200
The card transformed?

139
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,090
Paladin's Necklace?!

140
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,270
What is he planning?

141
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,400
This is your last chance to surrender.

142
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,810
Once I use this, you could end up dead.

143
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,150
You're clearly bluffing!

144
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,910
Now wait...

145
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,660
This is my chance.

146
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,950
Book.

147
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,120
I give up.

148
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Obviously, you're never going to surrender.

149
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,670
Take them.

150
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll silence him.

151
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,420
Crushing his windpipe and
knocking him out would be best.

152
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,180
Then I can take the cards from his binder.

153
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,440
I have one request.

154
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,660
What is it?

155
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,780
Could you leave me this card?

156
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,690
Bah...

157
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,440
He blocked my second attack with Gyo!

158
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,080
But I did manage to crush his windpipe!

159
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,010
He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.

160
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,570
Genthru...

161
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,080
You have made the worst mistake you could make.

162
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,830
Gasoline
A glass container
filled with fuel.
Highly flammable.

163
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,580
One minute!

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,090
What's that smell?

165
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,850
He can't use Little Flower any longer.

166
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm going to take him down!

167
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,430
Book.

168
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,330
Oh, so this is gasoline...

169
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,610
Very clever.

170
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,900
True, I cannot use Little Flower now...

171
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,360
However, I have another ability,

172
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,990
Countdown.

173
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,830
The ability that lets me set a bomb

174
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,500
when I touch someone and say "Bomber."

175
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,990
The bomb can only be disarmed
by touching me and saying,

176
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,500
"I caught the Bomber."

177
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,160
This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.

178
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,100
You won't be able to block it with Nen.

179
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,450
All the activation requirements have been met.

180
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,520
If I touch you and say, "Bomber,"
the countdown will begin.

181
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,920
Try to run away...

182
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,020
If you still have the strength.

183
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,650
The requirements have been met... for me!

184
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,160
First comes rock...

185
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,580
This is his earlier attack...

186
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,660
If get too close, I'm done for.

187
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,910
Is he trying to keep me back?

188
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,330
Rock...

189
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,800
Paper...

190
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,530
Rock!

191
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
A pitfall?

192
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,850
But he's falling with me!

193
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,860
It's deep...

194
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,750
I can't climb back up.

195
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,880
But he should be in the same boat.

196
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,370
He's ended up cornering himself.

197
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,000
He's gone.

198
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,730
Genthru...

199
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,380
If a card is removed from
the binder for a minute,

200
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,860
it reverts to an item.

201
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,560
Large Rock

202
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,890
A rock?!

203
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,930
First comes rock...

204
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,780
Rock...

205
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,920
Paper...

206
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,760
W-W-Wait!

207
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,510
I surrender! I surrender!

208
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,590
Rock!

209
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,320
Osu!

210
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,700
Are you awake?

211
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,410
Summon your binder.

212
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,150
We want you to return the cards you stole

213
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,160
from the people you backstabbed.

214
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,840
On one condition...

215
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,840
Use Archangel to heal Bara.

216
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,820
We have a Clone card.

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,720
Don't worry.

218
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,340
That was always part of the plan.

219
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,610
We brought six copies of Clone.

220
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,240
Book...

221
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,840
Gain!

222
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,880
What is your wish?

223
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,630
We need you to heal his hands and throat.

224
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,640
Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?

225
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,970
Easily done.

226
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,890
Then I shall heal his body.

227
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,250
I'm healed!

228
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,920
Then, farewell.

229
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,860
All right!

230
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,540
Okay, here's the extra Archangel.

231
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,960
Gain!

232
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,670
Next up is Killua.

233
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,650
Genthru, we're going to use your binder.

234
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,560
Go ahead.

235
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
Clone on!

236
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,510
Breath of Archangel has reached
its maximum card limit.

237
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,200
Clone will be destroyed.

238
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,290
W-W-Wait!

239
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,420
What's going on?!

240
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,960
Did I do something wrong?

241
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,790
No, it's Goreinu.

242
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,450
Huh?

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,270
He used Clone or Transform to increase the
number of Breath of Archangel vouchers.

244
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,960
So two of his vouchers became
Breath of Archangel cards.

245
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,290
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

246
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,660
Yo, it's Goreinu.

247
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,980
Looks like you won.

248
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,480
But I don't approve of this.

249
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,770
If you plan to use Breath of Archangel
to heal these murderers,

250
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,230
the trade is off!

251
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,890
You okay with using it on me?

252
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,090
Of course.

253
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,610
I am an assassin.

254
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,550
Eh?

255
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,870
I've killed more people than these guys.

256
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,670
Each player in this game risks their
life in one way or another.

257
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,480
That doesn't make it okay to kill others.

258
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,870
But all the people I've killed were
not nearly as prepared to die.

259
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,510
I'm worse than these guys.

260
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,810
No, you aren't like them.

261
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,800
I like you, but I hate their guts!

262
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,670
That isn't a valid reason!

263
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,910
I don't need a reason...

264
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,270
What counts is how I feel.

265
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
Aren't you guys the same way?

266
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,770
But we don't think it's right

267
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,130
to let them die because we hate them.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,630
In battle, both sides risk their lives,

269
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,240
and are prepared to kill.

270
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,660
But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.

271
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,040
I haven't forgiven Genthru for
killing all those players...

272
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,900
But the three of us agreed before the fight

273
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,430
that we'd bring six Clone cards.

274
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,550
I don't really remember why we decided that,

275
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,810
but it wasn't based on logic or reason.

276
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,060
It was just the decision that came naturally to us.

277
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,160
Once the fight was over and we'd
obtained Breath of Archangel,

278
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,570
we planned to heal everyone.

279
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,710
All three of us made the decision,
so we wanted to stick to it.

280
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,830
But I understand how you feel,
and we can't change your mind.

281
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,700
Sorry, Killua...

282
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,250
Could you wait a little longer?

283
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,050
No problem.

284
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll recover on my own in a while.

285
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,330
The situation's changed, so we
can't use Clone anymore.

286
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,030
There's only one Breath of Archangel left.

287
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,720
Only one? Isn't that the original?

288
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,600
Use it on Genthru.

289
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,170
I'm fine...

290
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora.

291
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,210
Yeah.

292
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,740
Hey, wait up...

293
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,250
Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel.

294
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,220
Huh?

295
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,210
Really? Are you sure?

296
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,600
Yeah, actually...

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,300
Before you told me all this,
I planned to give it to you.

298
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,630
Not just Archangel, but all of our cards.

299
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,680
What?!

300
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,390
Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed.

301
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,700
We've decided to give up on the game.

302
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,900
Wow, I'm completely healed!

303
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,820
Oh, so Mr. Battera...

304
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,900
Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his
team for breaking his promise.

305
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,770
I got four billion out of it.

306
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,910
Four billion?!

307
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,850
Hey...

308
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,390
Share some of the wealth!

309
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,920
Wh-What are you talking about?

310
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Each of the four of us gets one billion!

311
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,500
Eh?!

312
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,290
It's only fair...

313
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,910
I couldn't have done this on my own.

314
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,550
It was only possible because
I teamed up with you guys.

315
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
I can't believe it...

316
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
You're such a nice guy!

317
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,310
Anyway, you can take all the cards.

318
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,930
On one condition!

319
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,210
You must be the first players to beat the game.

320
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,030
Yep!

321
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,940
Not a problem.

322
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,270
That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.

323
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,200
Leaving only #0.

324
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,020
One card to go...

325
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,330
Yeah.

326
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,170
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight...

327
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,190
And this is...

328
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,340
Maid Panda
A species on the
verge of extinction.
Tidy, loves to cook,
and some individuals
enjoy Western clothing
and gardening.
Excellent at taking
care of human children.

329
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,340
ninety-nine!

330
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,590
This announcement is for all players.

331
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,480
A player has collected ninety-nine
restricted slot cards.

332
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,660
Ten minutes from now, in honor of this event,

333
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,610
there will be a quiz contest
for all Greed Island players.

334
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,560
There will be one hundred total questions

335
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,620

Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,880
I get it.

341
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,530
The questions are probably
designed so that players

342
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,020
who mainly stole cards can't answer them.

343
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,370
Someone's coming!

344

Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
