00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,720
There are six distinct categories of Nen users.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,110
Enhancer.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,030
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,960
Transmuter.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,740
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,220
Conjurer.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,140
Emitter.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,460
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,860
Manipulator.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,440
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
Specialist.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,690
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,720
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,030
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled Nen user.

17
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,650
Mito-san!

18
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,330
I'm going to find Ging!

19
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,300
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.

20
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,270
Take care of yourself until then!

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Wish x And x Promise

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,110
As Gon and Killua depart from Whale Island,

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,850
Kurapika was also preparing
to begin his journey.

24
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,400
You remember me?

25
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,270
Sure, we don't get many visitors here.

26
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,330
Since you were here, only one
other person has dropped by.

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,390
This place is much harder
to find than you realize.

28
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,840
You found the agency on your own,

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,670
so you must be pretty sharp.

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,680
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.

31
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,970
I have no problem with your lack of experience.

32
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,460
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.

33
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,230
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.

34
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,270
What do you mean?

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,080
I said that I have a Hunter License!

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,450
But your exam hasn't ended yet.

37
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,370
I can tell.

38
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,680
What?

39
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,710
You can't see a thing, right?

40
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,210
Once you've learned to see,

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,180
return.

42
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,770
You can't see it, but you can sense it.

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,910
Why did you do that?!

44
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,160
This?

45
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,620
Well, I was just playing with you.

46
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,300
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,840
Consider this advice from a veteran...

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,200
You didn't notice when I stole this,

49
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,010
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,750
Bastard...

51
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,860
Return my Hunter License!

52
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,540
Can a newbie who knows nothing

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,610
of Nen defeat me?

54
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,360
Nen?

55
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,570
Wanna give it a try?

56
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,450
Understand now?

57
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,890
You still lack something.

58
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,660
Come with me.

59
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,030
I'll be your teacher.

60
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,900
The real exam has only just begun.

61
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,030
Today, we'll determine which
class your aura falls within.

62
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,590
There's something forming in the water...

63
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,440
You're a Conjurer.

64
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,810
A Conjurer...

65
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,160
A type that specializes in
manifesting their auras.

66
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,390
I see...

67
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,560
Ideally, I would have liked to
have been an Enhancer.

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,460
Can't do anything about
what you're born with.

69
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,460
You can still learn Enhancer techniques.

70
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,580
I'll spend the day expounding in further detail.

71
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,670
Let's say you have a 100% chance
of mastering Conjurer techniques.

72
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,760
From that,

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,230
these are your odds of learning
the other techniques.

74
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:14,240
Enhancer 60%
Transmuter 80%
Conjurer 100%

75
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:14,240
Emitter 40%
Manipulator 60%
Specialist 0%

76
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:14,240
Hatsu

77
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,410
It doesn't matter if you're a quick study,

78
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,010
you can never completely
master a different category.

79
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,240
The further a category is, the less likely
you are to learn its techniques.

80
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,000
Why is Specialist 0%?

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,630
Specialist is a unique category.

82
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,500
You can't learn Specialist techniques.

83
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,960
These are very distinct abilities

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,510
that are genetic or naturally acquired by
growing up under extreme conditions.

85
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,370
So why is it in this specific position?

86
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,700
Because the adjacent categories,
Conjurer and Manipulator,

87
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,770
have the highest chance of
becoming Specialists later on.

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,250
In that respect, your chances
are better than most.

89
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,670
Remember what you said earlier?

90
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,280
I...

91
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,580
I need...

92
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,460
enough power to fight on my own!

93
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,340
You are correct

94
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,300
to assume that the fastest means to your
goal would be via Enhancer abilities.

95
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,210
The Enhancer category
is the most efficacious

96
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,810
for bolstering offensive,
defensive, and healing capabilities.

97
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,650
However, as a Conjurer,

98
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,550
you can only learn Enhancer techniques
at about half of their original potency.

99
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,680
When you attempt to use an ability beyond
your capacity, this creates strain,

100
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,260
which can weaken you,

101
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
possibly fatally.

102
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,170
In order to consistently come out
on top, you need a stable power.

103
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,690
Will the stable power gained through
mastery of Conjurer techniques

104
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,140
put me on equal footing
with master Enhancers?

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,530
The brief answer is that it would be difficult.

106
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,610
Enhancers employ strong offensive
and defensive abilities.

107
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,480
Conjurers usually suffer from an
inclination toward one or the other.

108
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,480
On the other hand, this makes them incredibly
strong under the correct circumstances.

109
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,790
Pop quiz time.

110
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,740
Is it possible to conjure a sword
that can cut through anything?

111
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,410
That is impossible.

112
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,490
Why?

113
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,750
Because that exceeds the
bounds of human ability.

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,650
Exactly.

115
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,610
Even if you completely master
Conjurer techniques,

116
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,790
you will still be unable to
conjure some objects.

117
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,960
You could conjure a sharp, sturdy sword.

118
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,010
However, it would make more
sense to just buy a good sword.

119
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,690
Because it wouldn't require
any additional training.

120
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,410
Though with Nen, you can easily make
the sword appear and disappear.

121
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,270
So conjured weapons aren't as effective
as their physical counterparts,

122
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,400
but you can't conjure anything omnipotent.

123
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,220
You will need to reflect on what
it is that you wish to conjure.

124
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,630
Failure is not acceptable.

125
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,370
Because you will need an incredible amount

126
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,920
of focus, imagination, and training

127
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,350
to conjure a single object.

128
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,740
This is a surprise.

129
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,300
Learning Nen only took you half a year?

130
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,180
So, what kind of employer are you seeking?

131
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,270
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.

132
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,410
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.

133
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm looking for someone who has a lot of
influence on the Yorknew auction.

134
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,090
The nature of the job itself is irrelevant.

135
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,830
The Yorknew City auction...

136
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,950
Employers with a lot of influence

137
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,260
generally post the more difficult jobs.

138
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,840
I doubt any of them will hire a
Hunter with zero experience.

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,590
I see three of them...

140
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,440
Three employers who will decide based on
the interview, rather than your record.

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,290
And they're only looking for bodyguards.

142
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,350
I'll give you descriptions,
so make your choice.

143
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,240
The first one is a gun fanatic.

144
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,610
Specifically, he's looking for a Midget Corp.
Golsnake 55, Limited Edition, Series #001.

145
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,790
The second one is a collector of fine china.

146
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,870
Wants Lord Corp. commemorative
plates from 1655 and 1657...

147
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,650
The third one collects human trophies.

148
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,580
Skin covered in snaking dragon tattoos,

149
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,390
jellied infant skulls, etc.

150
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,770
A fascinating hobby.

151
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,870
Well, take your pick.

152
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,390
Chains?

153
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,

154
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,760
that was the first thing that came to mind.

155
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,790
Chains, huh...

156
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,150
Why's that?

157
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,810
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be

158
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,160
chained down to hell.

159
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,160
Really, now?

160
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,510
I have a feeling that you're
really chaining yourself down.

161
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,550
What do you know?

162
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Hey! Wait up!

163
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,050
I'm your teacher!

164
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,140
I'm not finished talking!

165
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,220
Hold it right there!

166
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,190
Didn't you hear my explanation?

167
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,220
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!

168
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,480
And conjuring unbreakable chains is impossible!

169
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,700
On September 1st,

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,920
Yorknew City will host the
world's greatest auction.

171
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,520
That's where the spider...

172
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,500
Where the Phantom Troupe will appear.

173
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,150
What a fearsome heartbeat...

174
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,010
It plays a terrible melody of rage...

175
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,270
You want me to introduce
you to an employer

176
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,230
with connections to the Yorknew auction?

177
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,990
Yes.

178
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,620
Just like the last person who walked in.

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,280
Huh?

180
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,050
I got the same request twice today.

181
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,240
That's amusing.

182
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,540
The boy I just passed?

183
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,350
You know him?

184
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,480
What?

185
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,460
No.

186
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,050
He is interested in the auction, too...

187
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Why is his heartbeat so full of rage?

188
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,310
That twerp will only make
your dinner taste worse.

189
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,550
We're more than willing to
take you on a date.

190
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,940
We'll give you the best night of your life.

191
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,160
Unfortunately, I am not on a date.

192
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,890
I'm in the middle of a job.

193
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,520
A job?

194
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,320
This is my employer.

195
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,470
I am his bodyguard.

196
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,170
Bodyguard?

197
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,060
That's a riot.

198
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,510
This babe is a bodyguard?

199
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,440
I'd like you to guard my body.

200
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't guard ugly men.

201
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,870
Watch your mouth, woman!

202
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,960
Just shut up and...

203
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,170
180-Minute Love Slave

204
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,170
Instant Lover.

205
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,930
Every person I kiss becomes my slave.

206
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,970
Please command me, mistress!

207
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,980
Beat them up for me.

208
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,550
Yes, I would love to!

209
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,440
What?

210
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,640
Tsk, he got away.

211
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,420
Man, I'll have to find a new employer.

212
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,660
Such a splendid moon...

213
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,970
There he is!

214
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,590
Surrender!

215
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,730
Return the corpse samples you stole!

216
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,860
Don't you interrupt my work
or this splendid moon.

217
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,730
Enough fooling around!
Hands in the air!

218
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,110
Tsk, I was on the verge of
another masterful poem.

219
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,370
But you've ruined the moment.

220
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,230
"A splendid full moon
and pursuers as clumsy
as baboons could be."

221
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,760
Damn, that's horrible.

222
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,260
I know, Eliza.

223
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,450
If this job works out...

224
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,650
Yeah, don't worry.

225
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,180
I can take care of you

226
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,990
along with all of the dogs.

227
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,490
You don't need to worry, Eliza.

228
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,730
Just bear with me a little longer.

229
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,750
Yeah, it'll be fine.

230
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,950
You can count on me.

231
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,640
I was sent here by the agency.

232
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,290
My name is Kurapika.

233
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,870
Welcome.

234
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,050
Please wait in here.

235
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,820
I apologize for the wait.

236
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,500
Everyone has arrived,

237
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,470
so we will now explain the contract.

238
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,840
I'll start by stating the requirements.

239
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,480
I won't ask whether you have a License.

240
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm only interested

241
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,650
in whether you can obtain the items we request.

242
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,090
There's one month before the auction begins.

243
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,760
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,

244
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,360
and bring it here.

245
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,510
These are the data cards.

246
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,330
Lock of hair of the famous actress Sara.

247
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,360
Right arm of a mummy from an Egyptian tomb.

248
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,270
An ichthyosis patient's scaly skin.

249
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,010
Skull of a one-horned creature.

250
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,760
The eyeballs of a Kurta.

251
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,290
Hmm?

252
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,390
What's wrong? You look pale.

253
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,770
Ah, Kurta eyeballs?

254
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,850
A-rank obtainment difficulty.

255
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,910
"Preserve the scarlet hue
immediately following death.

256
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,780
Preferably with the head included."

257
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,900
I've heard rumors that when Kurta

258
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,080
get excited, their eyes turn scarlet...

259
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,790
Shut up.

260
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,780
Not another word.

261
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,010
I'll say it again.

262
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,050
You need only find one item from the list.

263
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,930
If you are successful, you will be hired,

264
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,520
to begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.

265
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,610
Best of luck, then.

266
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,000
I will pass this test.

267
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,820
First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.

268
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,020
The man talking was, most likely,
not the actual employer.

269
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,830
That only illustrates the distance
between the boss and me...

270
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,930
I shall reduce that distance to zero,

271
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,670
until the employer feels that he
can trust me with his secrets...

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,200
There are two things that
collectors always want.

273
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,720
The first is any item of extreme rarity.

274
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,100
The second is colleagues to whom they
can brag about their collection.

275
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,680
He must have connections to
other human parts collectors.

276
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,490
Collectors who share their
disgusting acquisitions,

277
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,370
a network of the lowest scum.

278
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,070
I'll worm my way in,

279
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,190
so that I can eradicate them all.

280
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,860
Hmm? The door won't open.

281
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,120
I forgot to mention one thing.

282
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,670
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...

283
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,020
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.

284
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,300
Kurapika pursues his quest
to avenge his brethren

285
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,180
and to punish the Phantom Troupe.

286
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,160
He prepares to step onto a new battlefield.

287
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

288
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

289
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

290
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

291
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

292
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

293
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

294
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

295
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:20,210
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

296
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,310
Today, we introduce Mizuken!

297
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,580
He's Kurapika's teacher!

298
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,410
The person who taught
Kurapika Nen.

299
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,940
He's classified as an Emitter.

300
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,530
I guess Nen users are fated to meet Nen teachers.

301
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:20,210
It seems he wasn't able to
earn Kurapika's respect.

302
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,450
That's what happened in our case.

303
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,090
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths!

304
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,090
Next Time: Nen x Users x Unite?

305
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,020
Hey, Gon...

306
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,570
Let's go break some of Milluki's figures.

307
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,310
Unite for evil?
