2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,810
This is a tomb.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,480
Your tomb.

4
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,250
I am very thankful.

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,020
Thankful for everything

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
that has made our meeting possible!

7
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,020
Zero x And x Rose

8
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,630
As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,

9
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,370
the King, his consciousness alone barely following
the afterimages of Netero's movements,

10
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,680
found that a single emotion reigned within him...

11
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,050
Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.

12
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,010
That's it.

13
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,550
He brings his hands together to start the attack.

14
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,680
That's the only motion he has
that far surpasses my speed.

15
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Such wasted movement could
cost one's life in battle,

16
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,700
but now, it works as a weapon
that may allow him to defeat me.

17
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,950
Trying to guess what drove
him to do this is pointless.

18
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,460
It would have required choosing
a path that defies reason.

19
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,220
I would presume that, at one point,
he was on the verge of madness...

20
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,530
Five years... Perhaps ten years...

21
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,980
And the entire time, he focused on this alone.

22
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,050
I recognize that

23
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,640
you have dedicated an incredible amount of time

24
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,350
to achieve the power you have displayed.

25
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,180
After all that, he's barely been scratched.

26
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,300
Not that I expected any different.

27
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,170
An individual

28
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,860
can reach his limit after much training.

29
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,030
You are a rare example of one
who has transcended that limit.

30
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,140
Bravo.

31
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
You have earned my praise.

32
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,170
An insect

33
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,590
should not talk down to humans!

34
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,890
The King's strategy was quite simple.

35
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,230
Keep attacking.

36
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,080
If the only attack capable of besting him,
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,

37
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,510
could do next to no damage,
the King had no cause for fear.

38
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,530
These are no more than dummy hands.

39
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,280
They can only move in set patterns.

40
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,590
If I attack from an angle that he can't
block with a move he's already used,

41
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,780
he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move.

42
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,450
Once I have verified all of the combinations,

43
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:07,860
I can find the angle of attack that will
force him to reveal another new move.

44
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,100
However, while he may have a limited
number of attack patterns,

45
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,120
the number of combinations they can
be used in may as well be infinite.

46
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,380
But every individual has a rhythm.

47
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,780
There will be an unconscious bias for,
and against, certain patterns,

48
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,620
and that bias naturally shapes one's identity.

49
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,320
If I can identify his personal rhythm,

50
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,650
I have a fair chance of guessing
which patterns he will select.

51
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,400
To find the single correct needle
among countless millions,

52
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,270
and thread it accurately...

53
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,560
is what it will take to pierce my target.

54
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,780
It may prove difficult...

55
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,920
But I will succeed.

56
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,700
I can accomplish it!

57
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,790
Old soldier, I beg of you...

58
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,230
Don't lose your life before I succeed!

59
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,690
He's laughing?

60
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,820
Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him.

61
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,530
No matter my attack trajectory,

62
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,800
he recovers immediately and moves to counter.

63
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,250
If I make a wrong move, his speed won't
allow me time to unleash the next Hand.

64
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,010
If I lose focus, he'll tear me
apart before I realize it.

65
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,390
This is a contest of endurance, in which
I must keep choosing correctly...

66
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,470
When I fail, you win.

67
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,480
That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!

68
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,160
No matter.

69
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,010
I shall checkmate you shortly.

70
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,160
Checkmate me if you can.

71
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,240
I'll show you my Zero Hand!

72
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,280
After hundreds and thousands of hits,

73
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,330
the King was beginning to feel the slightest
hints of dull pain within his body.

74
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,470
However...

75
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,570
Stop the bleeding.

76
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,260
Then tell me my name.

77
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,920
You have done well for a human.

78
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,900
What's wrong?

79
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,030
If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss.

80
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,530
Don't make me laugh.

81
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,050
I'll die?

82
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,640
You shouldn't get cocky after
landing a lucky punch...

83
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,300
The battle's just begun!

84
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,030
You have truly earned my admiration.

85
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,060
I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.

86
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,290
However, losing your leg was basically inevitable.

87
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,570
It is the consequence of using a defense that,
while not bad, was not the best choice.

88
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,640
After playing against Komugi, I learned
the art of anticipating enemy actions.

89
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,960
Your unconscious bias against certain patterns

90
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,090
gives me insight into the otherwise
limitless options you have.

91
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,280
Next, I'll take your left arm.

92
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,350
The ensuing fight

93
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,860
did not even last a minute.

94
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
This is

95
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,060
my life's final act!

96
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,280
As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve

97
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,990
heightened his physical and mental senses,

98
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,170
resulting in an exchange of more
than a thousand punches,

99
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,270
and sparking countless fireworks
between the combatants.

100
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,350
And then, the moment arrived.

101
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,220
His attacks began to show a slight inclination,

102
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,860
one not quite significant enough
to be called a habit or bias.

103
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,490
After using his body to bear the
brunt of Netero's attacks,

104
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,090
the King was able to find
the faint light beyond, and...

105
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,550
he reached it.

106
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,400
Are you satisfied now?

107
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Then tell me my name.

108
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,000
Ant King...

109
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,250
You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?

110
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,010
A prayer comes from the heart.

111
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,370
If the heart achieves the correct
form, it becomes emotion...

112
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,940
And emotions may be manifested.

113
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,290
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand

114
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,150
was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,

115
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,020
gently enveloping the target
with an indiscriminate love.

116
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,560
Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous
intent from a great distance away.

117
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,310
Not this way!

118
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,750
It had left such a strong impact,
Killua had changed his direction.

119
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,150
The entirety of Netero's aura

120
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,480
was transformed into a light as
blinding as a star, and fired

121
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,160
with a merciless roar.

122
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,860
The pinnacle of individual strength.

123
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,980
That was a magnificent attack.

124
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,560
Zero wasn't enough?

125
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,750
I was born to be King of the Ants,

126
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,330
to rule over all organisms.

127
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,670
I represent the instinctive hope
long nurtured by my species,

128
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,820
and that species continues to evolve for my sake.

129
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,790
I stand here now, the resulting boon
of the total support of my species.

130
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,130
You are an individual human, not a king...

131
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,010
I am the King that bears his kind's fate.

132
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,700
That was the difference in this battle.

133
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:44,570
The Chimera Ants' long evolution
has culminated in me.

134
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,710
This is a feat the human race, with its
individuality, can never match.

135
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,870
However, humans will no longer
be used to propagate our species.

136
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,940
We have learned that

137
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,220
the strong human ego disrupts
the bonds between Ants.

138
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,230
Out of respect for your efforts,

139
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,740
I shall allow humans to permanently
survive within a special zone.

140
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,240
We shall reevaluate the number and
quality of humans to be used as food.

141
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,000
Your lonely battle was not in vain...

142
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,400
I shall not repeat myself again.

143
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,260
Tell me my name.

144
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,330
I am not alone.

145
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,540
Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.

146
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,780
Meruem... That is your name.

147
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,370
As Netero spoke the King's name,

148
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,660
the King had no time to consider it,

149
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,090
as he watched the old man who was
supposed to be surrendering.

150
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,790
What is this?

151
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Meruem, King of Ants,

152
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,080
you understand nothing...

153
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,340
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!

154
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,790
It was the first time the King had felt fear.

155
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,230
One look at the face of this beaten old man,
who should have been waiting for death,

156
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:24,280
made it clear that his seemingly
vain words were no mere boast.

157
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,380
Should your heart stop beating, this will activate.

158
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,140
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.

159
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,690
I see now...

160
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,650
Yes... I see...

161
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,830
You had me in checkmate

162
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,480
from the start...

163
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,180
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,

164
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,290
while also proving surprisingly lethal.

165
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,020
With the right technology,

166
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,010
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.

167
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,450
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,

168
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,600
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,

169
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,350
and was popular with small dictatorships.

170
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,170
Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.

171
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,790
No matter what happens,
I won't betray my friends.

172
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,250
No matter what happens,
I'll believe in my friends.

173
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,630
Thank you, Chairman Netero.
