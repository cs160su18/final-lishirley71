2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,770
Did you sell him out?

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,860
Sell out Uvo?!

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,900
I'll take that as a yes...

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,370
Outta my way!

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,750
Hold on...

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,310
Let's hear his explanation.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,380
Explanation?

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,530
What is there to explain?

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,180
Calm down.

11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,630
Didn't the boss tell us that prophecies can
be avoided, depending on our actions?

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,280
Hisoka, explain what happened this week.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,190
I cannot.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,260
What?!

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,140
All I can say is that the first verse was true...

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,570
Nothing more.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,630
You hear that?!

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,290
Move!

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,720
Just hold on.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,770
Hisoka, why can't you explain?

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,590
If I were to tell you the reason,

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,340
I would be telling you
precisely what I cannot say.

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,780
Thus, I cannot say.

24
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,790
It isn't that I won't.

25
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,790
I cannot.

26
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,780
That's all I can let you know.

27
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,540
If you cannot accept my answer,

28
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,540
then in order to defend myself...

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,040
I'll have no choice but to fight.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,050
Allies x And x Lies

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,610
After seeing Hisoka's fortune,

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,520
Nobunaga suspects Hisoka of betraying them,

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,010
and draws his sword.

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,500
Forget it.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,940
You're impossible to deal with.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,720
As if, you fool!

37
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,110
What?

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,620
Nobunaga,

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,620
stop talking for a bit.

40
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,930
Huh?

41
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,020
Did the boss do that?

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,970
Probably.

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,630
Hisoka, I have a few questions for you.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,630
If you're unable to answer, just say so.

45
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,290
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

46
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,080
In the fortune, what are
the calendar's secrets?
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,890
The powers of the Troupe's members.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,150
Of how many members?

49
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,830
Seven.

50
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,490
No, eight.

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,880
The boss and Uvogin,

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,540
Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,

53
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,990
Pakunoda, Shalnark, and I add up to eight.

54
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,880
So until yesterday, you didn't
know of Kortopi's ability?

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,910
That is correct.

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,810
What is our opponent's power?

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,780
I cannot say.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,180
What about his appearance?

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,260
I cannot say.

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,020
What is your relationship to him?

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,370
I cannot say.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
I understand.

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,970
The red-eyed customer, the chain user,

64
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,860
has two abilities at the very least.

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,460
One would be the ability he
used to capture Uvogin.

66
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,570
The other would be the ability that
prevents Hisoka from speaking.

67
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,160
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,020
Since the fortune uses the
phrase "sword of law,"
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

69
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,870
the latter must be able to compel
you to follow set rules.
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

70
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,700
the latter must be able to compel
you to follow set rules.

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,250
"Do not lie to me."

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,260
"Do not give out any information about me."

73
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,840
Something like that.

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,570
I would also assume

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,720
that he placed something inside Hisoka's body.

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,020
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

77
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,640
The first half of the verse mentions a trade,
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,650
but the second half only describes
what the customer took.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,980
This suggests that the sword
of law would attack Hisoka.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

80
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,540
In other words, he traded the
sword's attack for our secrets.

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,990
Oh, so lovely...

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,620
The sword that can restrict Hisoka's
speech is powerful indeed.

83
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,380
You are magnificent...

84
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,880
I absolutely must be the one to kill you.

85
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,130
Let's review.

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,580
We're up against the chain user.

87
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,380
He's either a Manipulator who used
real chains to defeat Uvo,

88
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,140
or a Conjurer who used Nen
chains to defeat him.

89
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,130
Is there a difference?

90
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,350
A big difference.

91
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,600
A Conjurer could walk around unarmed.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,400
That's a huge advantage.

93
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,790
I see.

94
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,610
Conjurers have to exercise their imaginations,

95
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,910
but it's easy to conjure
something you're familiar with.

96
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,910
The problem is the power
that's restricting Hisoka.

97
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,690
Since it's the sword of law, it must
involve rules he has to follow.

98
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,340
Yes, it's very likely that two are the
commands the boss mentioned.

99
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,050
Also, he's probably barred from
attacking the chain user.

100
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,760
And I'd imagine that he'll die
if he breaks those rules.

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,860
How amusing.

102
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,140
There is no sword of law in my body...

103
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,690
That fortune was my own creation.

104
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,690
I only revealed the powers of two members.

105
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,190
Not eight.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,060
It was a risky gamble that would have turned

107
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,580
the entire Troupe against me,
if the boss hadn't figured that out.

108
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,210
All to keep the spiders in Yorknew City,

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,220
to allow me to fight the boss.

110
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,450
Should we leave Yorknew City,

111
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,970
it's hard to say when I'll see the boss again.

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,220
What about Hisoka's second verse?

113
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,160
"The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,

114
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,410
losing five more legs.

115
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,860
Do not leave your temporary shelter,

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,440
for you are one of the remaining legs."

117
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,700
If he leaves our temporary shelter, this base,

118
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,120
then Hisoka will die.

119
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,300
What does the homesick part mean?

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,250
It refers to our desire to go home.

121
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,270
If we return home, half of us will die.

122
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,370
I get it.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,430
Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda, Shalnark.

124
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,540
One more for half the members...

125
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,140
No one else's fortune predicted their death?

126
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,410
Then it has to be Feitan, Kortopi, or me.

127
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,640
We didn't get our fortunes told
because we lacked the data.

128
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,160
I am staying here.

129
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,650
There's something I wish to do before I die.

130
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,650
I will not be leaving our temporary shelter.

131
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,530
Boss, what should we do?

132
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,280
Leave or stay?

133
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Stay.

134
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,300
No.

135
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,070
Huh? Why not?

136
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,430
You were the one who wanted to
capture the Phantom Troupe.

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,180
It'd be pointless now.

138
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,330
But why?

139
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,070
With the reward gone, you'd be
taking a big risk for nothing.

140
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,440
Yeah, but capturing the Phantom
Troupe would be worth it!

141
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,680
You're getting your priorities mixed up.

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,850
Have you forgotten why we're here?

143
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,730
Greed Island.

144
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,830
Exactly!

145
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,810
The Southern Piece auction begins in two days.

146
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,460
We need to build up our war chest!

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,020
Actually, I have a great plan
to get the game.

148
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,840
What's your plan?

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,340
It's a secret right now!

150
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop being coy, and spit it out...

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,100
You're strangling me!

152
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,850
I'm going to die!

153
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,080
Anyway, I'll work something
out for the game.

154
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,350
So for now, let's stick to the Troupe.

155
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,600
Do you really have a plan?

156
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Yep, but it's not guaranteed to work.

157
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,740
How likely is it to work?

158
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,730
Huh?

159
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,180
What percentage do you think
your plan has of working?

160
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,990
Seventy percent.

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,290
Seventy?

162
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,290
M-Maybe more like sixty...

163
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,250
So it's a fifty-fifty deal.

164
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,850
That sounds much better than trying

165
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,870
to earn six billion in two days.

166
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,690
Okay, have it your way.

167
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,340
I'll let you handle the game.

168
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,640
But we can't deal with the Troupe alone.

169
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,300
We only move if Kurapika helps us.

170
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,330
Okay.

171
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,650
Boss, where are you going?

172
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,240
Shopping.

173
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,150
I told you earlier.

174
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,310
Basho and I will accompany you.

175
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,910
Can you watch over things here, Squala?

176
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,270
Sure.

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,410
I'm saved!

178
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,290
Guard the Scarlet Eyes well.

179
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,700
Yeah.

180
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,020
With these guys helping, I should be fine.

181
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm off, then.

182
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,260
Yeah, see you later.

183
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,570
How did it go?

184
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,690
I couldn't get a straight answer.

185
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,850
The community didn't have any updates
regarding the auction today.

186
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,330
You should tell them that
the Troupe is still alive!

187
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,910
Then the Mafia might rethink it.

188
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,450
No, nothing will change.

189
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,310
The community values its
relationship with Meteor City.

190
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,230
It's safe to assume that they will
not attack the Troupe further.

191
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,730
Really?

192
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,030
But that wasn't the information I wanted.

193
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,840
My only concern is whether the
auction will proceed as scheduled...

194
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,850
You're not planning to intercept them, are you?

195
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,530
That's crazy...

196
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,240
How can you confront them
without Mafia support?!

197
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,870
You have it wrong, Leorio.

198
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,360
I never had any help from the Mafia.

199
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,740
Kurapika, let us help.

200
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,650
We're willing to do anything.

201
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,490
Turn him down...

202
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,430
The reward was rescinded.

203
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,500
I know.

204
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,290
I want to stop the Phantom Troupe.

205
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,080
That hasn't changed.

206
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,000
Turn him down...

207
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,720
Turn him down!

208
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,260
You'd be risking your lives.

209
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,330
Come on, that's what he wants to hear.

210
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,680
Okay, let's put together a plan.

211
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,440
Uh-huh.

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,820
He agreed?!

213
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,910
First, we'll need someone to watch their base,

214
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,110
and to provide updates.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,280
I can do that.

216
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,900
The target is the woman named Pakunoda.

217
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,390
You can ignore everyone else.

218
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,120
Okay.

219
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,120
Be very careful.

220
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,620
Don't worry, I won't push my luck.

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,830
I'll need a driver to accompany me.

222
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,150
Leorio, could you handle that?

223
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,780
Huh?

224
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,880
Y-Yeah...

225
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,590
It'll be fine.

226
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,530
You'll be safe if you're with Kurapika.

227
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,760
Hey, Killua...

228
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,260
Don't make it sound like I
was scared or something!

229
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,410
Kurapika, what about me?

230
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,280
I need you to act as a decoy,
to throw the enemy off.

231
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,020
Got it.

232
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,470
Hold on!

233
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,540
Isn't that a dangerous role?

234
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,290
He'll have to face the Troupe members again!

235
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,420
That depends on our strategy.

236
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,530
Strategy?

237
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,780
What strategy will we use?

238
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,810
A very simple one.

239
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,310
While the enemy is occupied with Gon,

240
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,790
I'll capture Pakunoda and escape by car.

241
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,450
That sounds a little shaky...

242
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,250
There are too many uncertainties

243
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,790
for me to devise a concrete plan.

244
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,100
I'll let Gon decide his strategy.

245
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,370
But I'll need you to draw their attention
for at least half a second...

246
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,290
A full second if at all possible.

247
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,940
One second, then?

248
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,550
Yeah.

249
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,510
Draw their attention away for one second.

250
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,230
Can I do that?

251
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,060
Gon.

252
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,100
You are the key.

253
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,820
Can you handle it?

254
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,550
I'm not sure.

255
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,220
I'll need to think about it.

256
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,820
We have six hours.

257
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,820
If the auction proceeds as scheduled,

258
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,330
the spiders will make their move before then.

259
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,580
Hey,

260
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,500
why are you accepting our help now?

261
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,300
Because the risk I'm taking has increased.

262
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,090
I have to eliminate Pakunoda immediately.

263
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,230
No matter the cost.

264
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,350
He's...

265
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,010
So this is why Kurapika seems so different...

266
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,350
His resolve is even stronger.

267
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,850
Kurapika,

268
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,110
put a Nen blade in me!

269
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,080
A Nen blade?

270
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,500
Gon, weren't you listening?

271
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,450
Kurapika will die if he attacks anyone
who isn't a Troupe member!

272
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,570
Keep your voice down!

273
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,370
Then why is there a Nen
blade in Kurapika's chest?

274
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,740
Kurapika isn't a member of the Troupe.

275
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,260
What I'm about to tell you
will increase my risk further.

276
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,260
Okay.

277
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,020
Hey, Killua...

278
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,660
I'll start with the conclusion.
It is indeed possible.

279
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,660
The five chains have different abilities.

280
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,420
Two of the chains are for attacking spiders.

281
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,170
The first is Chain Jail.

282
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,090
The binded target is
forced into a state of Zetsu.

283
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,640
This power is for capturing the spiders.

284
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,640
And this is my Judgment Chain.

285
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,190
I point a blade at the target's heart,
then state rules that they must follow.

286
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,820
If a rule is broken, the target dies.

287
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,530
As you've figured out,
I pointed a blade at my own heart.

288
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,780
At first, I devised the rule that I would die if I attacked anyone besides a spider

289
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,040
with my chains, and I set a
blade pointed at myself.

290
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,340
But that was when I realized something.

291
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,570
Would using them on myself be
considered a violation of that rule?

292
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,170
It was possible I would be an exception,

293
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,170
but I didn't know for sure.

294
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,440
That's why I adjusted the rule.

295
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,780
I can only use Chain Jail against the spiders.

296
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,070
Meaning that I can use my Judgment
Chain on those who aren't spiders.

297
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,510
But first, a condition must be met.

298
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,450
A condition?

299
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,460
This chain can only be used
when my eyes are scarlet.

300
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,210
You can make your eyes scarlet now?

301
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,140
I had to work at it.

302
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,920
It took a while before I could
deliberately turn them scarlet.

303
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,340
I mastered the power in my middle finger
by vowing to never release this chain,

304
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,170
and to always risk death.

305
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,190
The power in my pinky was
resolved by my unique nature.

306
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,160
When my eyes are scarlet,
I become a Specialist.

307
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,760
And I can use any ability I've
learned at full strength.

308
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,250
I'm not sure what that means,

309
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,790
but you should be able to use
your Nen blade on me, right?

310
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,710
Yes.

311
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,090
Go ahead.

312
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,710
You can choose the rule to set.

313
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,970
I accept your resolve.

314
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,220
Can you make three of those blades?

315
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,470
You can rescind the rule once
our mission is over, right?

316
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,330
Killua! Leorio!

317
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,160
We had a little talk.

318
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,270
And since we're working together...

319
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,860
We should share the same fate.

320
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,500
What do you say?

321
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,260
The answer to both questions is yes.

322
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,870
But you three are wholly mistaken.

323
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,750
I never had any intention of
using my blade on you guys.

324
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Then why endanger yourself
by telling us your secret?

325
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,130
Gon, I wanted...

326
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,680
No, I wanted to thank all
of you for your resolve.

327
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,850
Even if one of you ends up revealing my secret,

328
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,840
I will have no regrets.

329
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,710
I have good friends...

330
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,870
That's not fair, Kurapika.

331
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,160
You're actually putting more
pressure on us this way.

332
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,170
That was my goal.

333
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,410
Oh, I get it now!

334
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,810
That isn't remotely funny!

335
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,680
Well,

336
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll head out, then.

337
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,040
Can't waste any time.

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,060
Be careful, Killua!

339
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,800
Yeah, I got this.

340
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,140
You will find eternal rest

341
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,500
in a room filled with black merchandise.

342
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,400
Beware solitude above all.

343
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,780
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.

344
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,500
On a dark day with very little light,

345
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,040
you will face two choices within a small room.

346
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,370
You must choose between pride and betrayal.

347
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,290
While the death-bringer hovers near.

348
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,890
Do not make any phone calls.

349
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,980
When it matters most, you will
be unable to reach anyone.

350
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,860
It would be unwise to answer the phone,

351
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,610
for the death-bringer will come
calling one time in three.

352
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,120
Let's break into groups.

353
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,510
We'll spend the next week
operating in these groups.

354
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,120
Avoid moving alone.

355
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,870
Shizuku, Pakunoda, and Machi.

356
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,750
Kortopi, Phinks, and Feitan.

357
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,010
Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.

358
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,260
Bonolenov, Franklin, and Hisoka will stay here.

359
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,640
Boss, can I ask a question?

360
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,080
Some kids know about this place.

361
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,770
Kids?

362
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,590
Well, they didn't have anything
to do with the chain user.

363
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,620
But I'm still worried.

364
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,710
Yeah! I forgot!

365
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,530
Boss, I want to recruit that kid.

366
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,400
Wait, that wasn't why I mentioned them!

367
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,040
Explain.

368
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,040
I see... He does sound interesting.

369
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,680
However, it doesn't sound
like he'll join the spiders.

370
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,420
We can convince him!

371
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,910
Just meet with him.

372
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,050
Boss, don't listen to him.

373
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,550
So, Machi, why the concern?

374
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,480
Um...

375
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,680
It's just a hunch.

376
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,350
Instinct, huh?

377
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,480
You have sharp instincts.

378
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,770
It's possible that there's something
important about those kids.

379
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,690
To be safe, we need more fake bases.

380
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,070
Kortopi, can you make ten more?

381
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,380
I can do another fifty.

382
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,080
And the instant anyone enters
a fake base, I'll know.

383
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,330
My copies function as En.

384
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,290
Something isn't right...

385
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,840
Am I in the wrong place?

386
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,180
No, that's impossible.

387
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,530
It can't be!

388
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,100
There are more buildings now!

389
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,460
As rain comes pouring down,

390
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,440
the operation to capture
Pakunoda commences.
