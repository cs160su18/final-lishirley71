2
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,000
What? Intruders?

3
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,010
Dispose of them.

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm busy right now.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,910
Don't bother me with reports
I don't need to hear!

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,570
Carry on now.

7
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,980
Date x With x Palm

8
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,910
I don't know which nation sent you.

9
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,610
But having entered this palace,

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,460
you must now die painful deaths.

11
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,010
Your Majesty...

12
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,790
I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.

13
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,110
This is a rare human.

14
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,930
An appetizing treat.

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,460
This is it...

16
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,840
This is the flavor I sought!

17
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,160
I feel it.

18
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,600
I feel it! I feel it!

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,960
This is it!

20
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,720
I can feel power surging through my body!

21
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,040
Nyow I understand...

22
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,950
This is the King's power.

23
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,730
He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.

24
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,610
In other words,

25
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,820
the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.

26
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,680
Hmm? Who are you people?

27
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,740
Guards!

28
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,630
What are you incompetents doing?

29
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,480
Worthless.

30
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't sense anything.

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,010
Insolent thugs!

32
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,130
Do you know who I am?

33
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,930
A supreme leader of this era,

34
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,890
a king among kings...

35
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,400
I am Masador Diego!

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,930
Why does that scum claim to be the king?

37
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,400
In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.

38
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,280
Humans without intelligence or talent

39
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,010
end up in positions of power due
to bloodline or connections.

40
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,180
That defies all logic...

41
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,130
In the hands of an incompetent,
power brings nothing but ruin.

42
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,420
This could only be the work of imbeciles.

43
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,410
We must provide proper guidance.

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,420
Absolutely.

45
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,720
However, they serve as quality meat,

46
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,430
and they are a self-renewing resource.

47
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,930
They are an easy food source.

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,970
The non-rare humans can be
used to feed our soldiers.

49
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,690
I shall use my godly power
to deal divine punishment!

50
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,150
Leave at once—

51
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,520
Allow me to dispose of this.

52
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
I can use it to control other humans.

53
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,390
Do as you like.

54
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,460
P-Please!

55
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,450
S-Spare our lives.

56
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,460
We beg you...

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,700
These humans are idiots.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,720
Think as hard as those weak
brains of yours can manage.

59
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,230
Have you ever spared a pig or a cow

60
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,550
as it begged for its life?

61
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,740
The view is excellent.

62
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,530
And there is plenty of space.

63
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,570
I dub this place the Meat Plantation.

64
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,520
It will be used for processing humans.

65
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,750
As you command.

66
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,080
After being defeated by Knuckle
and Shoot, Gon and Killua

67
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,340
return to the inn where Palm waits.

68
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,080
Before I worry about enemies,

69
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,770
I have to protect Gon from Palm.

70
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,900
You must take responsibility.

71
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,430
What?!

72
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,940
You promised to take me to NGL...

73
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,410
You said you'd swallow a thousand needles

74
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,820
if you broke that promise.

75
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Uh-huh, I'm sorry.

76
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,300
I don't want an apology...

77
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,850
But there's no point in having you
swallow a thousand needles.

78
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,870
Yeah.

79
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,330
So what can I do to make up for it?

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,020
Let's see...

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,590
You must...

82
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,690
do any one thing I say.

83
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,520
Hey!

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,200
Right now, do you know how Gon feels—

85
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,850
Okay, I agree!

86
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,100
Go out with me.

87
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,600
Go out with me...

88
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,780
Eh?

89
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,670
Okay.

90
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,720
Huh?

91
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,730
Do you have any idea what you're doing?!

92
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,620
Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.

93
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,370
And you have no problem
playing dirty like this?!

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,520
This is none of your business.

95
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,270
It's our problem.

96
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,380
It's up to the two of us.

97
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,390
You should stay away from her, Gon.

98
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,840
Don't interrupt us!

99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,390
This is something the two
of us must decide alone.

100
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,890
You just want an excuse to say that!

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,380
Just be quiet.

102
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,310
We're going out now...

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,150
There's somewhere I really want to go.

104
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,770
Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.

105
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,670
Eh?

106
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,910
Today, I have to train with Killua.

107
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
I know!

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,410
You can train with us, Palm!

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,860
Huh?

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,420
What are you talking about?

111
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,010
Didn't you say we'd go out?

112
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,420
Uh-huh.

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,990
Then, why is he tagging along?

114
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,480
And why would we train?

115
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,800
Are you toying with me?

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
This will be a date...

117
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
Our first date!

118
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,440
The first date for us!

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,330
The! First! Date!

120
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,160
But it isn't a date.

121
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,060
Huh?!

122
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,440
We can have a proper date later.

123
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,370
Since it's our first date, like you said.

124
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,450
Wow...

125
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,460
The word "date" keeps popping up.

126
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,520
And I need time to prepare for it, too.

127
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,210
Prepare? Prepare for what?

128
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,480
That's...

129
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,710
a secret.

130
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,970
You get to find out tomorrow.

131
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,550
Oh...

132
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,310
In that case,

133
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,980
it's fine.

134
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,170
Really...

135
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,100
If you'd explained first,
I wouldn't have been so angry.

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,990
Sorry about that.

137
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,740
But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!

138
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,980
You wanted to surprise me?

139
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,670
Gosh...

140
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,930
Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM,
in front of the bulletin board.

141
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,370
I'll be there!

142
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,980
Gon, you're amazing!

143
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,510
Huh? What do you mean?

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,110
Well, listening to you talk to Palm,
you seemed used to this stuff.

145
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,010
Really?

146
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,540
I was wondering...

147
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,770
Hmm?

148
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,310
Have you been on a date before?

149
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,270
Sure, I have.

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,570
Well, most of them were with Mito-san.

151
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,750
Oh, that makes sense...

152
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,610
Wait, who else was there?

153
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,860
Oh, some of the fishing boats

154
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,780
that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,

155
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,580
some of whom only liked younger men...

156
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,590
So I took them around the village
and had them teach me things.

157
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,140
T-Teach him things?

158
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,790
Th-That means...

159
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,620
He's a grown-up!

160
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,470
Women like that were called fanatics.

161
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,070
Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?

162
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,820
No! Of course not...

163
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,220
I spent all my time training as an assassin.

164
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,030
And ever since I quit, I've been with you.

165
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,900
Oh, yeah.

166
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,740
Right!

167
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,620
And I really don't want that to change...

168
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,120
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,620
Damn, I'm about ready to give in...

170
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,920
And this was my own decision...

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,140
Hello?

172
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
It's Knuckle.

173
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,560
We've located and secured Kite.

174
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,820
Really? Kite's okay?

175
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,650
Knuckle?

176
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,660
I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.

177
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,160
So I wouldn't say that he's okay.

178
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,570
That's fine.

179
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,920
There must be a way to bring him back!

180
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,610
All right, it'll take three days to get back,

181
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,860
so watch out for any soldier ants.

182
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,060
It seems they've scattered far
and wide, imitating the king.

183
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,240
Got it.

184
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,700
Yes!

185
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,160
I knew that Kite was alive!

186
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,330
That's great.

187
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,190
All that's left

188
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,550
is to protect you for a month.

189
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,480
Wow!

190
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
Look over here!

191
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,200
I've found a new feeding ground.

192
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,470
There we go.

193
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,850
What's that for?

194
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,730
It's a present for Palm.

195
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Are you sure about this?

196
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,160
If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?

197
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,490
If I just hand it to her, probably...

198
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,540
Whatever... Let's get back to town.

199
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah.

200
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,360
If we encounter soldier ants
here, in the mountains,

201
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,880
we'll be in serious trouble.

202
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,430
Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of
encountering ants looking for humans is high.

203
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,890
But while other humans are being
targeted, we can escape.

204
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,850
After all, Gon can't currently use his Nen...

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,350
So I must protect him.

206
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,940
Even if it means sacrificing everything else!

207
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,480
Let's hurry.

208
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,880
Drop your weapon,

209
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,620
place your hands behind your head,

210
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,310
and lie down on the ground!

211
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,320
If you don't comply within three
seconds, we will open fire.

212
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,690
Three...

213
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,680
Two...

214
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,320
One!

215
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,950
Ready...

216
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,320
Fire!

217
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,360
He disappeared?

218
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,210
Ow!

219
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,100
These guys are so slow...

220
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,110
This is no fun.

221
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,860
On to the next story.

222
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,290
Today, around noon,

223
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,690
an unidentified creature killed
seven people in Pata City.

224
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,870
The creature also injured multiple police
officers who had rushed to the scene,

225
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,370
before escaping into the Miera Mountains.

226
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,120
According to police testimony,

227
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,620
the creature moved at speeds exceeding
two hundred kilometers per hour.

228
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,750
Before leaving, it said, "I'll return
tomorrow. Bring faster humans,"

229
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,380
which means it could be a new
species of Magical Beast.

230
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,850
An evacuation has been ordered
for all area residents.

231
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,400
Pata City and the Miera Mountains...

232
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,130
NGL                                                                                           Republic of
Autonomous                                                                                   Rokario
Region

233
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,130
Inninge City
Miera Mountains
Pata City
Qwen City
Dory City

234
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,790
Another city lies between us,

235
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,590
with the Miera Mountains on the opposite side.

236
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,190
We should be okay...

237
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,380
The government has requested that
the Hunter Association capture it,

238
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,850
and the Association has accepted.

239
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,140
Next, we have the weather.

240
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm done, Killua!

241
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,460
Tomorrow, we're both on our own.

242
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,210
Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym.

243
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah, right.

244
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,350
I can't ditch Gon when he's
essentially defenseless...

245
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,310
Gon-kun, over here.

246
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,930
Hmm?

247
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,580
I didn't recognize you!

248
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,180
Who are you?!

249
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,410
Do I look strange?

250
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,380
Nope, you look really pretty!

251
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,750
Wait, stop it... You're too loud.

252
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,170
You're embarrassing me...

253
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,290
What? I'm just telling the truth.

254
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,230
That's enough. Let's go.

255
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,310
Quickly.

256
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,760
Damn...

257
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,260
What am I doing?

258
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,160
Now I look like the stalker!

259
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,750
No, don't let it get to me.

260
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,790
I have to protect Gon!

261
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,800
There's no telling when
the enemy will show up.

262
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,840
How far are they going to go?

263
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Something's there.

264
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,140
This aura is probably from a soldier ant.

265
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,060
It isn't that close,

266
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,420
but it isn't that far, either.

267
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,310
There are faint aura traces around.

268
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,930
Did it already pass through the area?

269
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,950
Or were they brought here by the wind?

270
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,310
Either way, there's a high
risk our paths will cross!

271
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,850
Should I warn them?

272
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,730
We're here.

273
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,550
Eh?

274
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,490
It's beautiful...

275
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,240
No,

276
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,940
there's no point in telling them.

277
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,200
Gon can't use his Nen.

278
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,970
If he gets upset about Kite and flies
off the handle with rage, he's finished.

279
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,810
Knowing Palm, she'll definitely
go nuts if I interrupt her date.

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,440
If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,

281
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,100
Use this chair.

282
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,010
the nearby ants will notice us.

283
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,640
Thank you, I'm fine.

284
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,030
I can't let them know...

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,870
I'll take care of this myself!

286
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,270
Oh, I thought I smelled a human...

287
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,340
That's...

288
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,020
I remember you.

289
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,380
You're one of those kids from before!

290
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,850
Looks like your luck's run out.

291
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,400
You're about to get a taste of hell.

292
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,060
But it won't last forever.

293
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
I moved upwind to catch his attention

294
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,130
and draw him away from them.

295
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,020
I've done what I had to.

296
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
But...

297
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,660
Where's the other kid?

298
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,630
Once you tell me his location,
I'll give you an easy death.

299
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,070
Well, he can't be that far away...

300
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,920
He's your buddy, right?

301
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,100
Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.

302
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,940
I'll just walk around making lots of noise
and swinging your severed head.

303
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,400
Then he'll come to me himself.

304
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,170
Isn't that how humans are?

305
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,750
He's right.

306
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,860
I have to defeat him,

307
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,700
or it's all over!

308
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,760
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!

309
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,770
Next time: Friend x And x Journey.

310
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,800
Going back to Whale Island with Killua...

311
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,540
Looking up at the stars with Gon.

312
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,520
We're going on a journey!
