00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,310
Facing the palace, each of the three exits

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,990
is progressively closer to the throne room.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,740
Okay, we're all agreed.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,020
We'll all use the closest exit,
and bust in from beside the central stairway.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Confusion x And x Expectation

7
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,920
This seemed like a good idea
since Leol-sama praised me so much,

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,670
but dispelling Nen is hard.

9
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,420
And the stronger the Nen,
the bigger my stomach gets.

10
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,490
This was a bad idea.

11
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,620
To a girl, there's nothing
worse than losing your figure.

12
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,060
I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!

13
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,120
Right, Shidore?

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,250
Having a peon that understands
speech is useful, but...

15
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,510
You really need to talk more.

16
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,360
You have permission to shoot her on sight!

17
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,020
As a foreigner, she can't blend
in with the other citizens!

18
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,810
Damn! Damn that woman!

19
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,170
What does she want?

20
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,150
Hey!

21
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,370
How many times have I told you
not to use your cell phone here?

22
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,660
The radio waves irritate my ears,
and it gives me a headache!

23
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,920
Plus, I can hear what you're saying.

24
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,930
Next time I catch you, I'll snap your
phone and your arm in half.

25
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,150
W-Well... There are urgent matters
that must be dealt with.

26
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,300
I need to use my phone.

27
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,310
It's so urgent that you find
the woman who ran away?

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,640
I can find her for you.

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,310
R-Really?

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,620
My nose happens to be very sharp...

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,460
If you have something she wore, I can track her.

32
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,070
The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,

33
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,740
and I respect you, as well!

34
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,330
So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here.

35
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,080
O-Okay!

36
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,770
Hold on, and I'll bring you something.

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,540
I will become the King behind the scenes.

38
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,270
To accomplish that, I must be friendly
with Bizeff, not with the King.

39
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,640
Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued.

40
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,220
Bah.

41
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,250
When peons send transmissions,
it gives me a headache.

42
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,090
This smells like...

43
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,800
Taragette's blood.

44
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,360
There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.

45
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,680
An intruder!

46
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,360
If he took his shoes off here
to avoid leaving footprints,

47
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,610
he must be somewhere deeper within.

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,870
He didn't hide his shoes because

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,120
he had a pressing mission and
couldn't afford to lose time...

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,100
That day last week, when it rained?

51
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,560
That was the day Taragette went missing.

52
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.

53
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,740
But that means he disposed of Taragette's body

54
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,600
while leaving his shoes behind.

55
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,000
There's no blood trail nearby.

56
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,890
If he wrapped the body in something to move it,

57
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,650
he must have come prepared.

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,650
Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?

59
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,180
Why would they do that?!

60
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,900
Damn, I don't get this!

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,570
Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?

62
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,410
No, I'll catch the intruder,
and get the answers from him.

63
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,680
He did head inside the palace!

64
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,890
Follow me!

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,300
What is your name?

67
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,440
It's K-K-Komugi.

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,380
Can you please tell me what your name is?

69
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,950
I didn't get to learn his name...

70
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,340
I can't wait to play him again!

71
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Who am I?

72
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,300
A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.

73
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,110
My subjects are mindless puppets.

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,610
If this is the fate that the
heavens have granted me...

75
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,940
I have no doubt that I shall
be slowly bored to death!

76
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,630
Don't follow me.

77
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,090
Yes, but—

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,390
Do not make me repeat myself.

79
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,830
Now we've all been beaten by the King.

80
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,150
The King says your En is irritating him.

81
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,770
I figured he would be saying that soon.

82
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,660
But I can't remove our security...

83
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,380
Then you go and tell him that!

84
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,590
I don't want another beating.

85
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,700
How does this sound?

86
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,040
We can block all aura in a radius
surrounding Your Majesty.

87
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,050
This way, my presence will not bother you.

88
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,680
Are you telling me to stay in one place?

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Given that keeping

90
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,650
the aura-free zone around me
while I move wouldn't be possible.

91
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,340
I refuse to have my movement
constantly monitored.

92
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,700
No, that would not be our proposal.

93
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,700
So if I do not wish to deal with your presence,
I will only be able to move

94
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,190
within that confined area.

95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,960
I must order you to move that zone
should I wish to go elsewhere?

96
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,910
There is nothing more I can say.

97
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,940
Keep your En focused outside the palace.

98
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,930
I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.

99
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,180
Are you dissatisfied?

100
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,440
Should that not suffice to guard
against outside attacks?

101
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,110
Or are you saying that there
are already enemies inside?

102
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:34,940
That would be admitting that your En
is completely worthless, would it not?

103
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,620
You're absolutely correct.

104
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:42,490
If my En is focused only outside, it cannot detect

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,020
any attack from underground.

106
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,800
In addition,

107
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,080
my En is not capable of recognizing
an enemy that is already inside.

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,010
Do you mean Komugi?

109
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,690
No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,

110
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,150
and they are free to enter and leave at will.

111
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,340
A check is performed each time someone enters,

112
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,160
but if the soldier were being
controlled by the enemy,

113
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,640
it would be difficult to know for sure.

114
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,790
That means—

115
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,690
Enough.

116
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,530
You may use En on the first floor of the palace!

117
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,290
That will permit you to guard
against any underground attack!

118
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,030
Tell everyone that no one is allowed
on the second floor or above.

119
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,800
Should an intruder come, I shall
deal with them personally.

120
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,980
Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!

121
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,540
If you disturb me, it will
have violent consequences!

122
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,730
The other Ants

123
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,810
were never allowed on or above the second floor...

124
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,470
But where do I go now?

125
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,440
The central stairway connecting the
first and second floors, I suppose...

126
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,800
If an intruder comes from underground,

127
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
you will be in position to deal with them.

128
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,740
Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately.

129
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,490
Is he upset about losing
all those Gungi matches?

130
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,270
I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.

131
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,470
My ability, Spiritual Message, would be
able to confirm my suspicions.

132
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,710
However, that would be an insult to the King!

133
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,750
No, I'm just making excuses...

134
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,000
The truth is that I'm afraid.

135
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,470
So afraid of what it is

136
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,500
that grows inside the King even as we speak,

137
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,090
I cannot bear it...

138
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,130
Tsk, the rain washed away the scent.

139
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,640
But now I have the answer.

140
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,010
The intruder hid here to
check the second floor,

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,280
but instead of going upstairs, he exited.

142
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,330
Something made him give up his mission?

143
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,770
Or did he accomplish his objective?

144
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,390
No, he may have used his power!

145
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,130
I should probably warn you...

146
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,030
If any of you go to the second
floor, the King will kill you.

147
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,280
Tell everyone else in the palace.

148
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,780
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,590
Wings!

150
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,560
What if the intruder has the power to fly?

151
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,090
The shoes and scent could have
been there to mislead us.

152
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,050
He could have flown up to the second floor!

153
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,380
Youpi-dono...

154
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,300
Huh?

155
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,200
Uh, er...

156
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,860
Pitou is monitoring the palace with En.

157
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,350
If they'd gone to the second floor,
they would have been caught...

158
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,210
Ah, sorry... It's not important.

159
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,400
Huh?

160
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,650
That doesn't make sense!

161
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,960
Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,860
Youpi-dono...

163
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,820
Huh? What is it?

164
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,370
Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use En?

165
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,200
For example, that day last week when it rained?

166
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,290
What? You didn't hear what happened?

167
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,970
There was a huge uproar...

168
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,710
The King tore off his own arm!

169
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,980
Pitou had to heal the King,
so Pouf was using his En instead.

170
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,970
How wide is his En?

171
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,420
I wouldn't know about that...

172
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,100
Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?

173
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,550
No, I'd guess that Pouf's En only
reached as far as the stairway.

174
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,900
The intruder saw that aura,

175
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,810
and gave up on ascending!

176
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,730
That all makes sense.

177
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,230
The question is what the
intruder's objective was,

178
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,610
and whether he's still hiding around here.

179
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,740
Do I tell Youpi?

180
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,620
No, I can't do that...

181
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,230
I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.

182
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,770
Pouf would be the best choice.

183
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,380
And if possible, I need to determine

184
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,250
what the intruder's objective was.

185
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,880
Otherwise, my report would be

186
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,210
that the intruder somehow
made it inside the palace,

187
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,640
but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's En.

188
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,440
I won't get any credit.

189
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,760
I can make up an objective,

190
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,430
but if the intruder is captured,
they'll find out I lied.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,470
But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions
and the intruder is never found,

192
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,100
it would only waste their time
and damage my own standing.

193
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,160
Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!

194
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,310
I have a great idea...

195
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,910
So the intruder captured one of my men.

196
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,300
According to Leol, that intruder
has the ability to teleport.

197
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,250
I believe that he and the
woman are working together.

198
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,690
They probably teleported out together.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,870
Damn, but why would they do that?

200
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,810
Yes, that's the question.

201
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,900
However, I've discerned their objective.

202
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,440
What is it?

203
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,940
To blow up the palace.

204
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,370
That's a lie.

205
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,220
What?

206
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,850
We must tell the Royal Guard!

207
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,810
Wait.

208
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,010
Don't be in such a rush.

209
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,450
We can tell them after we've found the bomb.

210
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,290
There's no time!

211
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,790
Calm down, and consider this
from their perspective...

212
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,940
Eh?

213
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,470
If they want to blow up the palace,
they'll wait until they're sure the King is here.

214
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,800
When would that be?

215
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,460
When all the citizens have assembled...

216
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,350
Right before the ceremony begins!

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,260
There will be five million humans!

218
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,580
What a sight that will be to see...

219
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,690
Just imagine looking down on them!

220
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,200
The King would not allow a double
to steal that gratification from him!

221
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,450
So he will be there in person!

222
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,090
It's only logical to assume the enemy
reached the same conclusion.

223
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,080
True...

224
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,540
I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's
side for many of these celebrations...

225
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,960
The experience brings indescribable
pleasure beyond even sexual gratification.

226
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,720
We still have over half a day
before the ceremony.

227
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,670
If I use my nose to track the intruder,

228
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,740
we can find the bomb with time to spare.

229
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,970
If we have proof when we report to the
Royal Guard, we'll look much better.

230
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,510
If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful.

231
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,860
Right?

232
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,530
Yes... That's true.

233
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,800
As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you.

234
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,430
Okay, that sounds good.

235
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,870
The coward finally calmed down?

236
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,620
I'm getting closer to becoming
the King behind the scenes!

237
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,380
Seven minutes to go.

238
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,350
I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.

239
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,920
Assemble near the exit then.

240
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,010
Until then, stand by.

241
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,620
Meleoron, about your power...

242
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,970
I know.

243
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,400
I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds
before I need to breathe...

244
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,150
And then, I'll tap you again when
I start to hold my breath again!

245
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,620
You don't need to push your limits.

246
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,840
You should catch your breath
whenever you need to.

247
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,530
When God's Accomplice isn't active,
you can trust me to handle things.

248
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,260
Why don't you have a smoke?

249
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,290
If you underestimate their sense
of smell, you'll die quickly...

250
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,120
Tracking someone by the smell of
cigarette smoke is simple for them.

251
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,220
We could be knocked out the
second I take my first breath...

252
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,730
The boss will be putting up a smokescreen
when we go in. It'll be fine.

253
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,320
I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk.

254
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't want to regret my decision.

255
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,590
The Royal Guard is on the move.

256
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,640
The three of them gathered above the
front gate to discuss something.

257
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,710
Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside.

258
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,050
Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,

259
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,720
so I don't think anything has changed.

260
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,970
I'll let you know if anything else happens.

261
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,600
Yeah, until we leave, feed us as
much information as you can.

262
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,630
Essentially, that eliminates the
possibility of the Royal Guard

263
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,610
being out of the palace.

264
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,580
Essentially, but not completely...

265
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,670
Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King.

266
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,870
You can't guarantee anything.

267
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,070
We have to be prepared for any possibility,

268
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,010
or we'll be slow to react when
something goes wrong!

269
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,890
You only say that because you don't
understand how loyal they are.

270
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,320
It's impossible that they'd leave the King!

271
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,620
The Royal Guard is always with the King!

272
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,430
And it's fine to believe that!

273
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,590
But we should prepare for any exceptions!

274
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,390
Give me an example of one
of these exceptions!

275
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,430
There are all kinds of exceptions!

276
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,650
Honestly, how can they be having
a dispute at the last second?

277
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,650
You're being too unrealistic!

278
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,650
One exception could be a woman...

279
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,890
Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?

280
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,810
I wasn't sure what the King was doing in
the palace, but he was reproducing.

281
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,030
That must be it.

282
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,800
I see...

283
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,080
That would give the King a reason to keep
the Royal Guard from his bedroom...

284
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,550
Perhaps Bizeff was bringing
women in for the King.

285
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,260
Palm and the King?!

286
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,960
We're sticking to the plan...

287
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,180
No matter what's happening to Palm!

288
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,690
Gon has no idea what they're talking about.

289
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm glad we realized this before we set out.

290
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,950
If we'd seen something like
that without warning,

291
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,950
we'd have frozen in our tracks.

292
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,680
Get it now?

293
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,530
You can never overthink something.

294
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,830
There are probably other unexpected
situations that we haven't considered yet.

295
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,560
Yes, something is still bothering me.

296
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,980
Gon...

297
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,210
Do you understand?

298
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,220
Let Palm take care of herself!

299
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,790
No matter what you see,
you must stay focused on Pitou.

300
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,970
Yeah!

301
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,440
It bothers me, but whether
a woman's involved or not,

302
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,060
I believe we should be prepared
for a third party in the palace.

303
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,980
I have a feeling that the third party

304
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,160
is causing my anxiety.

305
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,990
Why did the King injure himself?

306
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,110
Hold on...

307
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,990
That was just a theory of yours.

308
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, but you agreed that there
was no other logical explanation.

309
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,480
You're contradicting yourself...

310
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,130
Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?

311
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,550
Following that logic,

312
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,040
Pitou could have stopped using En
for other, unexpected reasons.

313
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,880
I understand that...

314
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,140
But something doesn't feel right.

315
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,960
With three minutes left to go, is this
something worth thinking about?

316
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,150
Yeah.

317
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,780
Yeah, think about it...

318
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,730
When would you try to hurt yourself?

319
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,040
When I couldn't forgive myself...

320
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
When you couldn't forgive yourself?

321
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,050
That's the logical conclusion...

322
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,820
But that would mean the King
is a ruler with personal pride,

323
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,400
and not just a cold tyrant.

324
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,300
True.

325
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain.

326
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,520
Speaking from experience,

327
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,180
people like him will never
be willing to compromise.

328
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,320
If the leader refuses to compromise,
neither will the Royal Guard.

329
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,010
You should assume that combat
will be our only option!

330
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,050
Morel was able to sum everything up...

331
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,660
But he's wrong.

332
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,120
The King's self-injury...

333
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,050
The third party...

334
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,210
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.

335
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,720
I have a feeling...

336
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:30,130
that the truth has the potential
to completely ruin our plans!

337
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,660
It's time!

338
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,260
One minute to go.

339
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,730
Gather around.

340
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,480
Damn! We're out of time...

341
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,250
At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown.

342
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,870
Let's do this, boys.

343
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,270
Get ready to rumble!

344
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,350
Next time: Charge x And x Invade.

345
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,900
Yeah, hot pots are great in winter...

346
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,700
Which reminds me of mystery pots.

347
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,800
Charge into the pot!

348
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,020
I think you mean toss into the pot...
