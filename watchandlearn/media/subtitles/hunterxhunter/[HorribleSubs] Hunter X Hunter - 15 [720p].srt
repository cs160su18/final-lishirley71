00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,930
Now!

10
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,730
I did it!

11
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,930
I figured it out!

12
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,780
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,410
Explosion x Of x Deception

14
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,120
Zevil Island, day two.

15
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
Gon has learned the technique

16
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,390
which will enable him to
capture his target.

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,040
Ow!

18
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,800
My hands are all bloody...

19
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,560
I've been swinging my fishing
rod for two straight days.

20
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,980
But now, I have perfect accuracy,

21
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,530
catching birds as they swoop
after their prey.

22
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,600
If I utilize this technique properly,

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,780
I'll be able to steal Hisoka's tag.

24
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,030
All that's left is to find Hisoka!

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,040
Ow...

26
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,330
But how am I supposed to find Hisoka?

27
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,980
I guess I'll just have to walk around,
and trust my instincts.

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,780
What?

29
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,560
Why are they gathering around me?

30
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,070
These butterflies...

31
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,570
They're attracted to the scent of blood.

32
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,750
Hisoka,

33
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,470
have you taken your target's tag?

34
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,590
No, not yet.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,590
You don't even know who
your target is, do you?

36
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,690
No.

37
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,100
Want me to tell you?

38
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,100
No, it doesn't matter.

39
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,110
I'll just find three others to hunt.

40
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,870
I remember that, back at the tower,
Hisoka was injured.

41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,380
If this works, the butterflies
might lead me to him.

42
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,390
Ah...

43
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,320
It's the guy who was grazed
by the arrow.

44
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,820
Better luck next year!

45
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,080
There he is!

46
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,140
Stay calm...

47
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,850
Stay calm!

48
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,670
I just need to wait.

49
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,900
For Hisoka to make his move.

50
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,120
Man, where is everyone hiding?

51
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,130
I haven't seen anyone for
the past two days.

52
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,140
Who's there?

53
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,970
Oh, hold on!

54
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,350
It's just me...

55
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,350
Tonpa!

56
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,810
Don't tell me that your target is...

57
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,990
Hey, wait a second!

58
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,480
Just calm down.

59
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,250
You aren't my target.

60
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,680
Prove it.

61
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Right...

62
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,130
Here.

63
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,020
Good thing I didn't throw it away.

64
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,170
Fighting people who aren't my target

65
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,560
is a waste of time and energy.

66
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,260
Don't tell me that I'm your target!

67
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,320
Unfortunately, you're not.

68
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,010
#246.

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,190
Ponzu, huh?

70
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,900
Huh?

71
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,030
You know who this is?

72
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,830
You didn't already know?

73
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,890
Uh, er, well...

74
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,040
I wouldn't put it that way.

75
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,770
I just didn't have a chance
to find out...

76
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,880
Heh.

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,530
Want me to fill you in?

78
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,740
What?

79
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,460
Your target's appearance, weapons,

80
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,550
special abilities, and weaknesses.

81
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,590
However, I have one condition.

82
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,650
Huh?

83
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,820
I think I ate some bad fruit.

84
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,380
Bad fruit...

85
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,620
To be honest, I can barely stand...

86
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,590
You want to become a doctor, right?

87
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,090
Do you have any medicine on you?

88
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,350
I got it...

89
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,270
Don't soil yourself.

90
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,020
I have all kinds of anti-diarrheal
and stomach medicine.

91
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,150
Oh...

92
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,640
Thank you so much!

93
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,530
First, tell me what you know.

94
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,530
F-Fine...

95
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,300
Ponzu is a female applicant.

96
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,540
Female?

97
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,650
As far as I know,

98
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,050
five of the remaining
twenty-four applicants

99
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,380
use some sort of chemical weapon.

100
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,550
Ponzu is one of those.

101
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,300
So she's the one.

102
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,140
This girl happens to

103
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,990
specialize in all kinds of drugs.

104
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,250
But her strategy is simple...

105
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,060
Hide and wait.

106
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,000
Hide and wait?

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,140
She sets a trap and waits for
her target to show up.

108
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,710
I see...

109
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,300
You shouldn't have to worry
about anything else.

110
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,410
If you make it a close-quarters fight,
you're guaranteed to win.

111
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,060
If you find her,

112
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,420
watch your footing, and note which
direction the wind is blowing.

113
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,500
Sh-She's fully aware that
someone else

114
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,640
is targeting her.

115
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,380
Th-That's pretty much it.

116
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,550
G-Give me the medicine...

117
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,430
Okay.

118
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,930
To be safe, back up a bit.

119
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,440
H-Hurry...

120
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,940
I-I can't hold it in!

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,570
Damn!

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,630
Your tag is mine.

123
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,750
I knew you were keeping your
tag in your suitcase.

124
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,500
Tonpa!

125
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,440
You two are working together?

126
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,010
Exactly so.

127
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,380
I didn't need your medicine.

128
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,010
I have my own.

129
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,680
And I might as well confess

130
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,530
that you actually are my target.

131
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,160
Wh-What about the card you
just showed me?

132
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,590
That's my target.

133
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,520
This is Tonpa's.

134
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,140
We swapped cards.

135
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,530
And you fell for our little trick...

136
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,150
There you have it.

137
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,660
Damn you!

138
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,620
I'll make you pay!

139
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,910
Uh-oh...

140
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,810
Tonpa!

141
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,450
We'll meet at the usual place!

142
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,570
Gotcha!

143
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,580
Hold up!

144
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,180
I'm gonna kill you!

145
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,460
Hey, now...

146
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,270
I'm not the one with your tag!

147
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,020
Shut up!

148
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Good grief...

149
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,440
You still haven't learned
your lesson, rookie?

150
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,730
What was that?

151
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,900
It's your own fault for letting us trick you!

152
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,400
Besides,

153
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,910
working in teams during the
Hunter Exam is common sense!

154
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,530
I agree with the latter,
but I cannot accept the former.

155
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,040
Huh?

156
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,440
You shouldn't be tricking people,
in the first place!

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Kurapika...

158
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,050
Leorio, want to team up?

159
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:51,140
Hunter Vocabulary

160
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,140
Target

161
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,910
Please Do Not Feed!!

162
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,920
Hey!

163
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,420
Return my tag!

164
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,130
If you want it back, catch me.

165
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,190
Okay!

166
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,590
I retrieved my tag.

167
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,700
And we have the tags for
#16 and #118, as well.

168
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,010
So, Kurapika,

169
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,600
Tonpa was your target?

170
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,270
You saved me back there.

171
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,010
You needn't thank me.

172
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,670
I didn't want Tonpa to notice me,

173
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,280
so I stayed hidden

174
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,210
while you were jumped from behind.

175
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,280
What?

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,530
Well, that was because

177
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,360
I figured there'd be no point in teaming up

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,220
with you if you couldn't
withstand that attack.

179
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,460
I suppose that you barely qualified.

180
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,730
You really are full of yourself...

181
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,090
Well,

182
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,170
I can't deny that it's easier
to work as a team.

183
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,230
Let's stick together for the
remaining four days.

184
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,230
Yes.

185
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,450
You got your target's tag.

186
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,850
So with your own, that adds
up to six points.

187
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,520
Assuming he doesn't take it back.

188
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,820
The #118 tag is only worth
one point for either of us.

189
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,500
But it might still come in handy.

190
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,390
Next, we need to find your target,

191
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,760
#246, Ponzu.

192
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,260
Stay alert, in case we're being followed.

193
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,280
You shouldn't be talking.

194
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,170
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,270
You're absolutely right.

196
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,250
I know you've been following me
since the exam began.

197
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,020
You fail at hiding.

198
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,850
Show yourself.

199
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,810
Let's play.

200
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,100
Well, come on out.

201
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,100
I know you're there.

202
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,600
He noticed me?

203
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,860
If you won't come out, I'll come to you.

204
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,490
I guess that's it...

205
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,000
In that case, it's all or nothing.

206
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,510
When did he arrive?

207
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,390
I challenge you to a duel.

208
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,900
You'll die.

209
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,410
This is my chance!

210
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,420
My chance is about to come...

211
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,930
In the moment Hisoka goes
to finish off his prey!

212
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,980
Why?

213
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,410
Why isn't Hisoka fighting back?

214
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,750
Hisoka, explain yourself...

215
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,750
Why won't you attack me?

216
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,780
If I continue to avoid your attacks,

217
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,010
you'll die eventually.

218
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,570
I can tell from the swarm of
Hemotropic Butterflies

219
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,310
that your wounds are grave.

220
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,520
Someone else has already dealt
you a fatal blow, yes?

221
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,870
Though I do understand your
desire to die in battle.

222
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,880
If you...

223
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,780
If you understand so well,

224
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,080
why do you still refuse to fight me?!

225
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,700
I have no interest in the dead.

226
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,080
What?

227
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,930
I'm not yet...

228
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,430
You're already dead.

229
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,800
It's in your eyes.

230
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,060
Bye-bye.

231
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Sorry about that.

232
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,680
I carelessly let him escape.

233
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,340
Liar.

234
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,120
He probably begged you to grant him

235
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,740
one final wish, yes?

236
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,850
Well, I felt sorry for the guy.

237
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,820
Given that he was dead either way.

238
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,500
You should cease pitying enemies
who serve no purpose.

239
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,080
You've done it before, haven't you?

240
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,860
You've walked away from opponents
before finishing them.

241
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,230
I have standards.

242
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,870
I'm not interested in people
who have no purpose.

243
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,870
I only spare those whose deaths
would go to waste.

244
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,330
What about his tag?

245
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,460
Oh, I already took it.

246
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,850
I have six points now,
so I don't need this one.

247
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,090
You can have it.

248
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,100
Whose tag is this?

249
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,930
It belonged to some guy
who tried to snipe me.

250
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,700
He ticked me off, so I killed him.

251
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,240
Well, then...

252
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,380
This is always so fascinating to watch.

253
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,880
It's pretty hard on me...

254
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,140
I feel much better.

255
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,750
Well, I'll just sleep here
until the final day.

256
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,990
Good luck.

257
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,930
It's completely dark now.

258
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,280
Keep your guard up.

259
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Night provides the perfect chance for
someone to attack their target.

260
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,940
I know that.

261
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,940
Well, I need two more points.

262
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,700
I suppose I should go hunt someone...

263
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
I'll get him this time!

264
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,240
Found you...

265
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,740
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.

266
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,000
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.

267
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,280
Four days remain before the
exam's Fourth Phase ends.

268
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,100
Next time: Defeat x And x Disgrace!

269
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,670
Let's shake hands!

270
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,760
With a firm grip.
