00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,480
Approximately thirty minutes after
the Hunters entered the palace...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,650
As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,060
an immense number of citizens
hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,600
still waited outside for the selection process
that would turn them into soldier ants.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,530
Meanwhile, a creature in the form that
they would soon become began to stir.

7
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,030
Breakdown x And x Awakening

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,550
Okay, all charged up.

9
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,030
Someone's watching me.

10
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,250
And...

11
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,910
It's probably someone I know.

12
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,010
No one's there?

13
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,530
While her appearance hadn't totally changed,

14
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,060
Palm was clearly no longer the same person.

15
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,230
And that greatly disturbed Killua.

16
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
She was captured

17
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,070
by the Royal Guard...

18
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,070
And she's been transformed!

19
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,740
If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,

20
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,710
he won't be able to take it...

21
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,570
There's no room left in his heart.

22
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,090
If the transformation has
reached as far as Palm's heart...

23
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,510
I can see Gon completely breaking down!

24
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,610
I must learn the answer.

25
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,790
We still have a chance.

26
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,830
Palm approached me herself!

27
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,870
Palm?

28
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,570
Palm must have sensed me

29
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,000
before I noticed her watching me...

30
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,020
Using that power she told us about before.

31
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,080
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.

32
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,780
I thought she could use some kind
of divination to locate people.

33
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,890
But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.

34
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,980
From her position, Palm shouldn't
have been able to see me...

35
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,250
The only conclusion is that she was
watching me by some other means.

36
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,290
And if Palm were an enemy,
she would have backed off...

37
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,910
Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.

38
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,550
And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't
remember me anymore.

39
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,780
Since she approached me,

40
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,300
she must remember me...

41
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,510
Remember us!

42
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,320
Killua, yes?

43
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,090
I knew it...

44
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,510
She has her memories!

45
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,230
Where's Gon?

46
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,950
Once he's seen what I've
become, will Gon hate me?

47
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,610
Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.

48
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,090
And you're assuming that he
doesn't already hate you.

49
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,970
You're always so spiteful...

50
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,350
Well, it doesn't matter.

51
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,990
I have nothing to gain from your pity.

52
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Where's Gon?

53
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,280
Gon's with Pitou.

54
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,660
He's—

55
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,740
Why can she see me,

56
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,510
but she can't see Gon?

57
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,750
What's wrong?

58
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,250
Was it chance that you happened to find me?

59
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,440
Huh? What are you talking about?

60
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,010
You're the one who turned the corner.

61
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,150
Wrong! I sensed you watching me.

62
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,480
That's why I came this way!

63
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,260
You noticed me first.

64
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,760
Why are you lying?

65
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,780
Troublesome brat...

66
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,390
Where's Gon?

67
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,400
Answer my question first.

68
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,290
Did I notice Palm watching me
only when she physically saw me?

69
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,200
Does that mean Palm actually
saw me once, then immediately left?

70
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,510
Then she used clairvoyance
to watch me follow her,

71
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,770
and turned around so it'd look
like she was approaching me?

72
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,550
For the last time...

73
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,940
Where's Gon?

74
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,230
I won't tell you.

75
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,200
You're an enemy, aren't you?

76
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,200
I made a mistake...

77
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,100
I used my power incorrectly.

78
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,960
When I was brimming with rage,

79
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,610
I should have let my emotions take over!

80
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,620
Black Widow
Dark Demon Goddess

81
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,600
Sh-She's dangerous!

82
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,380
Better to let everything out than hold it in.

83
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,670
That includes my desire to kill you!

84
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,620
Well? What now?

85
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,910
Will you die without a word?

86
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,500
Will you die after speaking?

87
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,660
Or will you just die?

88
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,810
Palm's ability to arm herself by covering
her body with her hair, Black Widow,

89
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,830
varied in appearance according
to her emotional state.

90
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,510
But defense was its primary function.

91
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,840
What made Black Widow frightening

92
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,980
was the fact that she could rely on
her hair armor for protection,

93
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,600
allowing her to devote all
her energy to her attacks.

94
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,370
P-Palm-san! Turn off your Hatsu!

95
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,550
Palm is an Enhancer.

96
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,880
When everything clicks, it's possible
to become this much stronger?

97
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,930
I completely blocked the attack,
but I still took damage.

98
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,010
If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage.

99
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,560
But I can't run away.

100
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,990
Gon's mind is already at its limit!

101
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,010
He's barely holding himself together,
while he waits for Pitou.

102
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,030
I can't let them meet.

103
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,120
Even if Palm's heart is still there...

104
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,510
It'll have a negative effect now!

105
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,600
Palm!

106
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,420
Why are you looking for Gon?

107
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,570
Depending on why, I might be
willing to tell you where he is.

108
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,310
Huh? Why are you asking now?

109
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,550
There's no reason...

110
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,910
I just want to see him.

111
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,820
He's probably nearby.

112
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,660
I'll find him myself.

113
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,660
Once I've killed you!

114
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,340
Sorry!

115
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,820
I panicked and called you an enemy...

116
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,730
But even if you look different,
you're still Palm, right?

117
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,910
Gon is suffering.

118
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,880
Someone he deeply respects
was completely transformed.

119
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,390
That person had his soul taken away.

120
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,240
Right now, Gon is facing off
against the one responsible!

121
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,970
If you appear before Gon
looking as you do now...

122
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,960
Gon will...

123
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,510
totally snap.

124
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,180
So you have to

125
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,170
call him by his name first.

126
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,290
You must say, "Gon."

127
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,100
That's the condition.

128
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,730
Tell him you're okay.

129
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,620
Before we entered the palace,

130
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,050
Gon was really worried about you.

131
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,930
Give him some peace of mind...

132
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,570
He was just buying time.

133
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,270
He had no intention of letting them meet.

134
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,260
That was the idea...

135
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,990
Help...

136
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,530
make him feel a little better, if you can...

137
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,430
Only you can do that now!

138
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,640
No one else...

139
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,830
can do it.

140
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,270
I can't...

141
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,910
do anything!

142
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,380
Once he'd said those words,

143
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,420
the dam within him burst.

144
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,770
He's completely defenseless.

145
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,930
Change in plans...

146
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,030
Kill him now, #1!

147
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,410
When Palm had infiltrated the palace,

148
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,710
arriving at the exit Knov had
placed near the stairway,

149
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Pitou's En returned.

150
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,300
Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt
as though she'd be crushed to dust,

151
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,510
she reached the same conclusion Knov had.

152
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,060
As she watched Pouf slowly and silently
descend the stairs, she made her decision.

153
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,870
She plotted to take her own life,

154
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,010
so she would look like a despairing girl
who could not bear Bizeff violating her.

155
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,080
However, Pitou prevented that from happening.

156
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,550
As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,

157
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,470
no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura

158
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,090
to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura
at the moment she was exposed to it.

159
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,180
The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,

160
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,970
and after receiving permission from the fasting King,

161
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,010
Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.

162
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,850
Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered

163
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,520
their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.

164
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,830
This was most noticeable in Ants who
had learned how to use Nen.

165
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,690
Memories of the past tended to both assist
and deter the growth of soldiers.

166
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,550
Deterrence generally happened

167
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,900
when memories led to emotional reactions.

168
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,100
Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded
that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe

169
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,330
to destroy the connection between
Palm's memories and her emotions.

170
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,140
The experiments that produced Cheetu
and Leol confirmed that those

171
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,640
who retained more of their memories
emerged from their cocoons sooner.

172
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,440
To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,

173
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,680
leaving soldiers with their memories, while
keeping control of them, would be best.

174
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,330
Palm was the perfect test subject.

175
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,660
The success of her experiment would
signify the end of the human race.

176
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,470
Now go, #1...

177
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,910
Beat the kid before you to death!

178
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,000
Shut up.

179
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,970
I am

180
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Palm Siberia.

181
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm not #1!

182
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,500
I will never become a pawn to you Ants...

183
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,310
Even if it costs my life!

184
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,180
Killua...

185
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,240
Thank you.

186
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,350
There was a wall inside my head.

187
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,860
My emotions were separated from my body.

188
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,320
I couldn't do anything about it.

189
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,100
I've been like this since I woke up.

190
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,280
You removed the barrier.

191
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,170
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.

192
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,110
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.

193
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,660
But you must not forget...

194
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,110
You are the one Gon needs most.

195
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,470
What is it?

196
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,420
Failure.

197
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,570
That's all there is to it.

198
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,710
Slow and steady it is.

199
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,470
Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...

200
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,740
Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.

201
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,240
I can create soldiers on my own!

202
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,260
That will make it easier
to build a new kingdom

203
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,740
for the King and me.

204
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,620
Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power

205
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,580
Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?

206
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,010
Wait, this is mine.

207
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,590
Oh, well.
