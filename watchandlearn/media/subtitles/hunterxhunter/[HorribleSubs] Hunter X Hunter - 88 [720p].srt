00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,850
Given his personality,

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,000
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,110
I doubt he'd sell me out,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,520
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,740
My chance will come after they leave.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,210
I will defeat them...

8
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,000
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness

9
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,110
The man targeting Gon and Killua

10
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,470
is named Shoot McMahon.

11
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,400
He, too, is one of Morel's students.

12
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,490
This won't work.

13
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,210
In our current condition,
we don't stand a chance...

14
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,270
Yeah.

15
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,690
I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using
less than half of his strength.

16
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,630
Probably so.

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,430
But we have to fight him.

18
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,470
Yeah...

19
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't sense anyone else around.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,390
It's the perfect chance.

21
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,900
When I take my target down, I am
always deliberate and thorough.

22
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,330
That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.

23
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,970
Here we go... This is my chance.

24
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,180
What's wrong?

25
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,190
It's the perfect opportunity.

26
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,670
Right now, I can easily...

27
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,560
Go...

28
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,050
Go!

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,620
Shoot McMahon...

30
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,900
He is a coward.

31
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,950
Hey, Killua...

32
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,220
Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?

33
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,010
Hmm? What do you mean?

34
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,160
Why didn't they let him go to NGL?

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,480
He seems really strong to me.

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,100
Well, that's true.

37
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,710
In terms of physical ability,
he'd be a match for Kite.

38
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,360
It's probably a mental thing.

39
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,020
Mental?

40
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,550
His approach isn't in line
with this mission's objective.

41
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,490
He's too soft.

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,290
And he gets attached to animals too easily.

43
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,750
And he did end up volunteering
to help us, somehow...

44
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,130
And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.

45
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,110
Yeah...

46
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,850
They can maintain their Ren for two hours
without having to really concentrate.

47
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,980
That's a good sign...

48
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,420
If they can do it for three hours,

49
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,690
I might consider letting them fight
Knuckle when they're fully rested.

50
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,690
Knuckle will then be forced
to use his full strength.

51
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,970
I hope it will be enough to teach them...

52
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,950
That which they lack, that which they need.

53
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,200
But that still only takes them halfway.

54
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,300
If everything goes well, it'll take them
about ten days to reach that point.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,130
And that means they'll have no more
than a day left before time's up...

56
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm not sure they can make it.

57
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,480
I should probably prepare for my escape...

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Save my own skin.

59
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,150
Help yourself.

60
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,880
Thanks!

61
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,370
Yum!

62
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,640
What do you think?

63
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,730
Oh, this is really good!

64
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,430
Not that!

65
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,120
We only have ten days.

66
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,640
Huh?

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,390
From what I've seen,

68
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,050
you're only two-thirds through your training

69
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,850
to become strong enough

70
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,530
to force Knuckle into using his full strength...

71
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,430
Uh-oh...

72
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,530
She knows exactly what's going on.

73
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,790
Huh? Is that true, Bisky?

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,340
But it'll be fine!

75
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,020
We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!

76
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,800
How can you be so sure?!

77
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,300
The situation hasn't improved at all...

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,770
You said it was all right for
me to speak up, so I will.

79
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,690
You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!

80
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,070
They didn't give you enough time...

81
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,240
Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,

82
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,610
staring at it to calm myself.

83
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,520
That means I'm nearly over the edge,

84
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,290
so if you run at once, before it's too late,
I probably won't try to chase and kill you.

85
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,640
If not for her outbursts...

86
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,290
This would be a pleasant meal...

87
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,410
We aren't gonna run away.

88
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,790
How many times do I have to say it?

89
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,960
What else can you do?

90
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,430
As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!

91
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,550
We'll win!

92
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,310
Pinky swear.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
Come on... Hurry up!

94
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,190
I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle
and Shoot before the deadline.

95
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,010
If I break my promise, I have to
swallow a thousand needles...

96
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,740
Pinky sworn!

97
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,700
On the island I'm from, there's another part.

98
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,190
You go like this and put your thumbs together.

99
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,580
Sealed with a kiss!

100
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,980
Okay, now it's a promise.

101
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,950
By the way, Palm-san,
what did you use to flavor this?

102
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,600
Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones...

103
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,010
Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.

104
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,230
I suspect she's the one leading
things in that direction...

105
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,110
I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,

106
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,290
then I let it sit for another night.

107
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,740
Ten days left.

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,150
Don't say that like a countdown to our death!

109
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,010
This is it...

110
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,900
Smoke that covers the forest like fog.

111
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,450
Baital squad here.

112
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,270
Goran, give me an update.

113
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,490
Goran, do you read me?

114
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,770
Goran!

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,470
Could they have already taken him out?

116
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,330
Anyone from Goran's squad out there?

117
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,350
Give me a report!

118
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,250
Hey...

119
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,900
We can't see anything with all this smoke...

120
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,060
We've been trying to reach Squadron
Leader Goran, but he won't respond!

121
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,110
Any sign of the leader?

122
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,970
I can't see the guy in front
of me! What's going on?!

123
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,970
I've lost contact with him!

124
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,940
He was right beside me a moment ago!

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,650
I can't see a thing!

126
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,140
He just vanished into the smoke!

127
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,500
Yah! There's a hole!

128
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,510
With all these messages,
I can't tell what's happening...

129
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,430
They should've established a communication
network to operate in the leader's absence.

130
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,010
Baital squad, forward!

131
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,690
Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.

132
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,810
Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act
as rearguard for the Baital squad!

133
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,520
Proceed in a V formation!

134
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,810
The number of soldiers is dropping.

135
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,030
What's happening?

136
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,720
Now.

137
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,590
Hey, Baital?

138
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,870
So you're next?

139
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,770
Are you sure this is a good idea?

140
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,380
What do you mean?

141
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,480
All we do is send enemies to the old man.

142
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
He's the one who takes them out.

143
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,430
This is a little too easy.

144
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,390
But it is a surefire method.

145
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,890
Can't argue there.

146
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,650
The Chairman was being modest...

147
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,530
He's still much stronger than we are.

148
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,350
And he seems rather excited about this.

149
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,910
Oh, speak of the devil.

150
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,780
Keep sending them my way.

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,030
I'm finally starting to regain my touch.

152
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,790
Impressive...

153
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
And how about the Queen?

154
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,050
She hasn't made a move.

155
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,680
The Queen is still holed up in her nest.

156
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
Then the King hasn't been born yet.

157
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,190
Continue to monitor the situation.

158
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,030
Roger that.

159
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,550
The old man's on a roll.

160
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,890
Shall we grab another squadron?

161
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,870
Yeah.

162
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,460
Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.

163
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,330
We're down to fourteen squadrons.

164
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,820
Damned humans.

165
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,500
How are they managing to whittle us down?

166
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
I don't know.

167
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,310
All I know is that there are some
humans who are very strong.

168
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,420
We know too little about humans.

169
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,230
They appear to possess a variety
of powers far stronger than ours.

170
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,240
Had we more time, we could
obtain that power, as well.

171
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,080
However, once the King is born,
we will hold the advantage.

172
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,500
Yes, I hope that will be the case.

173
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,360
You want to come out?

174
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,810
Not yet.

175
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,480
It's still too early.

176
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,070
Okay, that's three hours!

177
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,710
Oh? Already?

178
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,890
That seemed fast.

179
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,700
Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.

180
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,840
Huh?

181
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,450
Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?

182
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,170
You can go once you're rested.

183
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,830
Defeat him.

184
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,590
You have a little over a day
before the Chairman's deadline.

185
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,720
This may be your first and last chance.

186
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,350
Well, if they're able to fight at full strength,
they'll have to accept the results, win or lose.

187
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,360
If they can each identify what they're missing,

188
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,140
then this training was a success.

189
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,390
Now, the problem is figuring out my escape...

190
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,910
Seems you kids are serious tonight.

191
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,770
Morning, Youpi.

192
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,270
Youpi?

193
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,030
To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi.

194
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,630
I'm hungry.

195
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,040
Before we begin, I want to
know where your partner is.

196
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,060
Eh? You mean Shoot?

197
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,950
Yeah.

198
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,680
Why do you want to know that?

199
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,180
You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.

200
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,270
We need both tokens.

201
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,450
That's a riot!

202
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,060
If you defeat me, I'll tell you.

203
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,740
We might not get a chance to ask you then.

204
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,820
You might be out cold.

205
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,070
You're no longer amusing me...

206
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,600
There!

207
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,850
Gon!

208
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,760
That hit hard.

209
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,260
I could feel the impact
throughout my entire body.

210
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,660
If I drop my Ken, his next
punch will knock me out.

211
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,000
After another four or five warm-up punches,

212
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,660
I'll get serious...

213
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,080
Better watch yourself.

214
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,830
I warm up fast.

215
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,860
Still no one coming out today?

216
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,880
No.

217
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,510
As expected, they've holed up inside.

218
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,890
Shall we make our move?

219
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,190
No, we're approaching the
deadline for your disciples.

220
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,640
We can wait until that's over.

221
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,910
Judging by the estimated number of
bodies currently stored in the nest,

222
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,300
they'll need to replenish in a week or so.

223
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,150
I would like to dispatch another

224
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,540
two or three squadrons at that time.

225
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,270
Okay, I'll leave it in your hands.

226
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,740
We don't move until we know
how our disciples performed.

227
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,170
I think it's a waste of time...

228
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,380
Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,

229
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,990
but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable.

230
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,050
We can't count on them for anything in a fight.

231
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,190
At best, they could act as decoys.

232
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,740
Hell, they'd probably get in our way...

233
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,470
I'm certain of it.

234
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,570
That old man always was a gambler...

235
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,500
Want to bet whose disciples
will show up tomorrow?

236
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,030
I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot.

237
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,580
If we're both wrong,
the Chairman gets the money.

238
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,840
How about it?

239
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,800
Sure.

240
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,090
Then, I'll put...

241
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,590
...1,000,000 on them.

242
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,700
Huh? That's just impossible!

243
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,540
Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?

244
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,860
The Chairman is a dog?

245
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,360
I happen to love gambling.

246
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,530
I always roll high...

247
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,370
There!

248
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,960
Behind you, fool!

249
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,950
He's still warming up?

250
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,270
Damn, he's strong!

251
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,450
But why is Knuckle...

252
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,950
Could it be...

253
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,760
Hey, aren't you going to use
that "First comes rock" thing?

254
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,510
Well, you won't be able to use that technique.

255
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,130
It's flawed, after all.

256
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,040
It's flawed?

257
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,260
A word of advice...

258
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,920
If you try that technique,
I'll stop you in your tracks.

259
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,810
In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it.

260
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,270
Your technique

261
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,510
has two huge weaknesses!

262
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,670
I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission

263
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,960
without sacrificing someone...

264
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,500
Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.

265
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,630
And love and sorrow!

266
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,900
And reassurance...

267
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,260
No biggie!
