2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,860
Now! Kill him!

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,040
Fake x And x Psyche

4
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,090
Hey, what's going on?!

5
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,170
Below us!

6
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,590
There was a huge explosion below us.

7
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,960
Enough waiting around...

8
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,170
I'll see what's happening for myself!

9
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,850
Everyone, please calm down.

10
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,480
I finally managed to contact the Ten Dons.

11
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,500
They wish to speak to you directly.

12
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,740
The auction will proceed,
so please remain calm.

13
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,420
Please enter the auction hall
on the tenth floor.

14
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:12,750
An underground chamber where everything costs extra.
That is where you will sleep.
Never descend stairs that you didn't first ascend.
Do not compete with others at numbers.

15
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,810
I'll be fine.

16
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,710
This is the tenth floor.

17
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,750
I'll be safe as long as I don't
go down any stairs...

18
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,630
It's all good.

19
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,760
Her fortunes are one hundred
percent accurate.

20
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,760
Her fortunes won't come true
if you heed the warning.

21
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,590
So I'm okay...

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,770
Yo, everyone all right?

23
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,980
First, I apologize for taking
so long to make contact.

24
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,280
Sorry.

25
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,120
There's been a lot of chaos,

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,780
but it's all cleared up now.

27
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,790
We've dealt with the Phantom Troupe's leader.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,400
It's only a matter of time before
the rest of them are finished.

29
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,670
We're letting the professionals
handle the hunt

30
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,810
so you can enjoy the auction.

31
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,550
Tonight, we'll be watching the auction live,

32
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,210
so let us see some furious bidding.

33
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,310
As you all just heard,

34
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,360
the Ten Dons will be watching a
live feed of the proceedings.

35
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,280
Please concentrate on the auction.

36
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,780
Illumi?

37
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,280
Yeah.

38
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,820
Where is my client?

39
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,520
Right here.

40
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,330
Oh, were you fighting?

41
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,790
Is he still alive?

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,260
Just in the nick of time...

43
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,180
That's a relief.

44
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,370
Well, relay a message.

45
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,070
I've killed the Ten Dons.

46
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,590
Tell him to write the money
to my account as agreed.

47
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,420
Up we go...

48
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,060
Good grief.

49
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,750
It seems we both get to live another day.

50
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,570
Aren't you supposed to kill me?

51
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,810
We were hired by the Ten Dons.

52
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,820
Now that they're all dead,

53
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,310
you are no longer our target.

54
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,330
Really? That's surprising.

55
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,320
You won't get another chance like this.

56
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,360
Do you believe that we kill for pleasure?

57
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,600
We don't do this for fun.

58
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,840
I refuse to work for nothing
or die for nothing.

59
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,100
Did you know that I hired Illumi
to assassinate the Ten Dons?

60
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,850
Of course.

61
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,850
But that's irrelevant.

62
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,780
We simply do the job we're hired for.

63
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,050
I see.

64
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,730
Say, can I ask you something?

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,020
If you and I were to fight one-on-one,

66
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,370
who would win?

67
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,540
Most likely, I would win.

68
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,930
Unless you decided to actually try to kill me.

69
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,070
Honestly, you're a cheeky kid.

70
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,280
So he could tell?

71
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,010
What a drag...

72
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,050
I couldn't steal their powers.

73
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,420
So you want us to wait at L Hospital?

74
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,880
Yeah, it's more dangerous
here than anticipated.

75
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,420
We'll send her over by ambulance.

76
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,430
She's just unconscious,
so you shouldn't have to worry.

77
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,770
But she'll be much safer at a hospital.

78
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,050
Make the preparations.

79
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,310
Looks like you had fun, boss...

80
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,870
Yeah.

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm a little tired now.

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,230
You were up against the Zoldyck family.

83
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,400
I wish I could've seen how
those two fought you.

84
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,210
Fighting would be more fun than watching.

85
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,950
Kortopi, everything ready?

86
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,630
Of course.

87
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,660
I can't make living copies,

88
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,380
but I can provide static copies.

89
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,410
Good enough.

90
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,040
Then we'll stick to the plan.

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,600
Also...

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,480
Don't touch the ambulance that girl is in.

93
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,730
Will we really be safe on the trip over?

94
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,250
If they planned to attack the ambulance,
they would've done so on its way here.

95
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,770
And you shouldn't have to worry
about stray bullets anymore.

96
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,880
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.

97
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,000
We will now begin the auction!

98
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,010
Allow me to introduce our
first item of the night...

99
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
I was concerned for a moment.

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,980
But all's well that ends well.

101
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,580
And none of the leaders were hurt.

102
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,020
We did well.

103
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,390
Thanks.

104
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,250
Allow me to introduce the next item.

105
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,300
An executioner's blade made of pure gold,

106
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,500
taken from the Yulu Museum
of National Treasures!

107
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,010
Let's start the bidding at 20 million!

108
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,420
40 million!

109
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,260
50 million!

110
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,880
I hear 50 million...

111
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,090
100 million!

112
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,500
I'll put him on autopilot now...

113
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,030
Next, we have the fabled
sacred jar of the Rai Dynasty,

114
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,410
Inspirational Blue.

115
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,130
The last pristine piece left in this world.

116
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,020
Um, Inspirational Blue is...

117
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,710
Over here.

118
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,110
Kortopi, this one is next.

119
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,290
Here, make a copy.

120
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,630
Okay.

121
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,300
Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand,
Demonic Right Hand

122
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,390
Here comes Inspirational Blue...

123
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,810
Let's start the bidding at 100 million!

124
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,730
200 million!

125
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,100
330 million!

126
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,810
380 million!

127
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Hey, there.

128
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,800
Aren't you going to participate
in the auction?

129
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,650
What do you mean?

130
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,820
The leader of the Troupe was killed.

131
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,140
Why wouldn't they proceed?

132
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,930
Impossible.

133
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,100
It can't be...

134
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,360
We're just mopping up leftovers now.

135
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,990
They're called pros for a reason.

136
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,890
While your useless ass was busy
fussing over an ambulance,

137
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,820
the Zoldycks got the job done.

138
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,380
So you're not needed any longer.

139
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,860
Just stick with your little fortune girl.

140
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,360
Run off to the hospital or the hotel.

141
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,860
Or will you lick the boots

142
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,120
of that old fraud who
failed to score any points—

143
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,330
I won't believe it.

144
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,410
Not until I see a body!

145
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,340
This is the boss?

146
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,030
He's young.

147
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,940
Cocky son of a bitch.

148
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,310
Hey, don't touch his head.

149
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,820
We're going to show his
face on the Internet.

150
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,260
We found the other members' bodies!

151
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,700
Okay, I'm on my way.

152
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,550
A total of five bodies?

153
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,200
Try to identify them.

154
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,270
DNA, teeth, fingerprints, disease...

155
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,340
Try everything you can!

156
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,710
You can dismember them,
but don't touch the heads.

157
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,790
Once we have their identities,

158
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,930
we'll kill their parents, siblings,
relatives, and lovers!

159
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,270
We'll make sure no one ever

160
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,760
tries a stunt like this again!

161
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,490
Now, everyone...

162
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,450
It's time for our last item tonight!

163
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,290
One of the world's seven
most beautiful items,

164
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,020
the Scarlet Eyes!

165
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,600
With the Kurta Clan's extinction,

166
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,320
only thirty-six pairs exist.

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,880
This particular set has a
particularly brilliant red hue.

168
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,900
Then, let's start the bidding at 100 million!

169
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,740
110 million!

170
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,590
120 million!

171
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,430
130 million!

172
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,010
150 million!

173
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,910
170 million!

174
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,160
Boss? It's Kurapika.

175
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,240
190 million!

176
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,500
200 million!

177
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,500
I apologize.

178
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,190
I have 200 million!

179
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,150
I predicted incorrectly.

180
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,130
The leader of the spiders is dead.

181
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,270
210 million!

182
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
220 million!

183
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,150
The auction is proceeding as scheduled.

184
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,150
230 million!

185
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,520
What?

186
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,560
240 million!

187
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,750
The Scarlet Eyes are currently
being auctioned.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,090
250 million!

189
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
260 million!

190
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,910
Should I bid on them?

191
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,080
Of course!

192
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,660
270 million!

193
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,660
You must win them.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,570
Is there a limit as to price?

195
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,890
No! Bid as much as it takes!

196
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,140
Win the Scarlet Eyes!

197
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,160
I understand.

198
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,900
300 million!

199
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,540
I hear 300 million!

200
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,170
Anyone else? Do I have any more bids?

201
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,800
350 million!

202
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,550
360 million!

203
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,540
370 million!

204
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,020
390 million!

205
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,920
500 million!

206
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,930
1 billion.

207
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,070
2.9 b-billion?

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes,

209
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,370
the skinhead who was in the
room with the assassins

210
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,190
put up a fight.

211
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,080
Zenji? Damn him...

212
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,640
I didn't expect to spend
this much, damn it.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,210
Curse that pig.

214
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,040
No matter...

215
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,790
This means that the community
receives more money,

216
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,590
which will benefit my reputation.

217
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,070
As long as I have Neon's fortunetelling,

218
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,220
I can easily make back that money.

219
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,580
It's not a problem.

220
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,620
Well done... Good job.

221
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,970
That's right.

222
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,210
This is an investment in my trek to the top.

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,790
In order to succeed,
I must keep Neon happy.

224
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,210
She is my trump card.

225
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,740
She always will be.

226
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,730
As long as I have her...

227
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,850
I can throw money at anything.

228
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,100
You're from the Nostrade Family?

229
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,720
Congratulations on your winning bid.

230
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,770
Is this the item you wanted?

231
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah.

232
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,520
Bastard.

233
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,530
You think you can just walk away?

234
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,260
Tsk...

235
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,530
Stop!

236
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
I'll blow your head off!

237
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,540
Move.

238
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,120
Don't be...

239
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,910
Just stop.

240
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,520
I don't care who I kill right now...

241
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,300
Even if it's you.

242
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,080
Who is that guy?

243
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,750
Yeah, I'm getting into this!

244
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,520
How about another?

245
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,800
Seriously...

246
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,350
They were drinking while
we were captured?

247
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,890
Oh, you're back?

248
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,350
Come and drink with us!

249
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,950
Are you an idiot?

250
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,860
We're underage!

251
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,110
And aren't you underage too?

252
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,940
What's your point?

253
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,850
In my country, you can drink
once you're sixteen.

254
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,110
I see.

255
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,120
Really...

256
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,240
I had no idea that happened.

257
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,130
I'm amazed you escaped alive.

258
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,130
The Phantom Troupe's that dangerous?

259
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,810
Back there, one of the tricks
you taught us came in handy.

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,370
If the exit is blocked...

261
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,600
Make your own!

262
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,100
I get it.

263
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm glad I was able to help in some way.

264
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,820
Experience can sometimes blind you.

265
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,440
A con artist's knowledge might come
in handy against the Troupe.

266
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,370
Exactly!

267
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,680
There's more to being a con
artist than you'd think.

268
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,210
I haven't just been drinking
myself senseless here...

269
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,030
I've been learning a lot from Zepile.

270
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,040
And tomorrow morning,
we'll hit the auction.

271
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,770
You guys are coming, right?

272
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,390
I'd like to, but I have to find Kurapika
and learn about Nen from him.

273
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,370
Kurapika? You got through to him?

274
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,640
Yep, but we're waiting for
him to call us back.

275
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,530
Hold on.

276
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,400
Did you say you need to learn
about Nen from him?

277
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,000
I did.

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,140
Why?

279
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,910
He just learned about Nen
recently himself, right?

280
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,410
But Kurapika managed to defeat a
member of the Phantom Troupe.

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,910
Seriously?

282
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
Yeah.

283
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,410
He must know some secret about Nen.

284
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Some strength that doesn't
require experience or power.

285
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,930
Yay!

286
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
Thanks, Daddy!

287
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,400
They're beautiful...

288
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,470
Are you feeling better now?

289
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,700
Uh-huh, I forgive you!

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,960
Really?

291
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm glad to hear that.

292
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,890
Good work.

293
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,240
My daughter is doing well,

294
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,950
so we'll head back to the hotel.

295
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,040
Tomorrow, we need to buy
the actor's used tissue.

296
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,610
And that will end the auction.

297
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,990
I'll be leaving the morning of
the day after tomorrow.

298
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,900
But I want you to accompany
my daughter as she shops.

299
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,480
Kurapika...

300
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,230
We can handle the remainder
of the auction and shopping.

301
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,190
You should get some rest.

302
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,740
Yes...

303
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,740
Thanks, I think I'll do that.

304
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,510
Is he really okay?

305
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,010
Hello? Kurapika?

306
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,590
Yeah.

307
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,160
You said you wanted to
stop the Troupe, right?

308
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,020
That won't be necessary now.

309
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,470
The spider is dead.

310
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,370
Huh? What do you mean?

311
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,780
Kurapika?!

312
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,970
Oh, a shame.

313
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,220
I'd hoped to provide some comfort.

314
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,540
The Mafia community was nothing special.

315
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,530
We didn't even need Nobunaga.

316
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,280
Shut up!

317
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,680
What'd he say?

318
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,060
The Troupe's dead.

319
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,300
What?!

320
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,430
Seriously?

321
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,600
He hung up.

322
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,560
I have no way to find out any more.

323
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,840
Kurapika is now drowning in
an indescribable emptiness.

324
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

325
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

326
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

327
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

328
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

329
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

330
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

331
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

332
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:20,000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

333
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,370
Today, we introduce Kortopi.

334
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,700
A Phantom Troupe member.

335
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,450
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

336
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,280
Beware of Gallery Fake, his ability to

337
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,450
A Conjurer.

338
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,800
conjure a copy in his right hand

339
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,190
Uses his right hand to copy
what his left touches.

340
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,370
of what his left hand is touching.

341
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,990
I might be a fake.

342
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,710
What?

343
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,310
Note: He can't conjure living copies.

344
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,050
Next time: Fortunes x Aren't x Right?

345
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,050
My horoscope was horrible today.

346
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,980
Oh, there's a Choco Robo here.

347
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,810
Lucky! So much for that horoscope!
