00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,710
But you know...

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,560
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,700
After you said we could be friends...

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,740
I couldn't let you die!

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,870
I'm gonna save you!

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,000
Don't die on me!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Power x And x Games

9
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,970
While Killua was being rescued
by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,120
his supposed enemy,

11
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,990
Gon, too, was forming a bond with
a Chimera Ant called Meleoron.

12
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,850
You should stop smoking.

13
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,760
If the smoke sticks to you,

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,280
people can smell you coming, and it'll
waste your ability to become invisible.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
I appreciate the warning.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,750
But honestly, that doesn't matter.

17
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,020
While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,

18
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,890
my real power is on an entirely different level.

19
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,360
Just watch.

20
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,650
Huh?! He vanished in an instant...

21
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,440
I can't sense him at all.

22
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,770
Only the smell of cigarettes.

23
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,600
He's gone...

24
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,030
This isn't mere invisibility.

25
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,880
Does he also have the ability

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,920
to change locations instantly,
without making any sound?

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,650
That isn't possible!

28
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,580
How did he do it?!

29
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,960
Where'd you come from?

30
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,380
I've been here the entire time.

31
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,550
Huh?

32
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,200
My second ability is Perfect Plan.

33
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,810
God's Alibi
Perfect Plan

34
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,570
When I hold my breath,

35
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,810
no one can sense my existence.

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
You were even touching me...

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,820
But your mind didn't realize it.

38
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,940
Eh? I touched you?

39
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,330
You know how some people are easily overlooked?

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,490
When you go to a restaurant in a group,

41
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,760
there's always one person that the
waitress forgets to bring water.

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,830
This is an extreme version.

43
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,710
I'm right here, but no one notices me.

44
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,840
Oh...

45
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,920
I use my other ability to turn invisible

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,000
to cover this one so no one can learn about it.

47
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,700
For the record, you and I are
the only ones in the world

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
who know this.

49
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,050
Why tell me something so important?

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Well, it's to build trust.

51
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,840
Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...

52
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,030
If I can't convince you to trust me,
we can't start anything.

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,540
You mean, what you said about
me being a valuable partner?

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,300
Yeah, but that's for later.

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,580
Like I said, we have to trust each other first.

56
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,550
Once you've agreed to be my
partner, I'll tell you more.

57
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
Okay, I'll be your partner.

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,970
That was fast!

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,080
You don't know how to bargain, kid.

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,180
Don't me so trusting of me!

61
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,150
Suspect everyone!

62
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,440
Until you've done due diligence,
don't trust anyone!

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,250
Huh?

64
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,610
I said it's okay, so why are
you being so difficult?

65
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,660
Can you even make this decision on your own?!

66
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,900
What about your buddy?

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,180
He'll have a fit

68
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,870
when he hears you teamed up with
a suspicious-looking monster...

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,050
And why am I insulting myself?

70
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,240
I didn't choose to be this way!

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,420
He talks a lot...

72
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,800
Whatever.

73
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,430
Even a friend of twenty years
could stab you in the back.

74
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,170
Time is no measure of trust!

75
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,180
Say, "Ho"!

76
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,320
You're no fun...

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,250
We can never be friends.

78
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,940
I feel the same way...

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,390
Then, are you sure about this?

80
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,350
About what?

81
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,190
About teaming up with me.

82
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,280
Won't your buddy object?

83
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,570
Most likely.

84
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,790
Because he tends to be cautious
and to question everything.

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,790
This won't work, then.

86
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,870
The deal's dead in the water.

87
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,580
But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine.

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,980
Killua won't like it, but he'll give in.

89
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,380
Really... He must have a hard time.

90
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,780
Well, whatever.
If you say it's okay, I'll trust you.

91
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,360
So let's get to business.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,070
Yeah.

93
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,770
I want to defeat the King.

94
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,800
Want to know why?

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah, of course.

96
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,270
That's what I've been waiting for...

97
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Revenge.

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,260
Right now, I can't tell you
why I want revenge...

99
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,080
Okay.

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
I'd like to know, but I'll wait.

101
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,690
That's probably what he wants to hear...

102
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,910
If you're that curious, I'll tell you.

103
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,050
You'll tell me now?!

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,870
Just kidding!

105
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,680
Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now.

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,430
I didn't beg you for anything.

107
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,400
The King killed someone I owed my life to.

108
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,680
His name was Peggy.

109
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,320
I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.

110
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,830
But at the time, I didn't realize
what had happened.

111
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,860
Huh? Why not?

112
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,780
You saw it happen, didn't you?

113
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Because I'd forgotten that Peggy

114
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,940
was the one who raised me.

115
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,980
A little while ago, I began to recover my
memories from when I was human.

116
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,580
I haven't remembered everything.

117
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,300
No, I should rephrase that...

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,260
I've only remembered a few things.

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,750
The names of my parents, my name,
episodes from my childhood.

120
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Peggy was the name of the
Chimera Ant the King killed.

121
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,110
That was also my foster father's human name.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,970
He was into education, and always
carried thick books around.

123
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,730
In both life and death, he never
parted with his books about NGL.

124
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,730
Then you all have memories
from when you were human?

125
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't know if we're all the same.

126
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,530
Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.

127
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,340
With others, there's no
telling what they're thinking.

128
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,530
But I think I understand now.

129
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,250
This is why, when we first met,
I was willing to trust you.

130
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,160
You're very human.

131
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,050
More human than any other
Chimera Ant I've met.

132
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,220
In fact, I'd say you're still human.

133
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,800
Really? When I met you,
I had the opposite reaction.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,750
Huh?

135
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,810
I could sense a vicious beast inside you.

136
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,500
That's why I wanted to team up.

137
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,820
There's no limit to what you'll do.

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,320
All right... Now, let's get down to business.

139
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,080
But first, could you tell me your name?

140
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,570
I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.

141
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,790
I actually have one more ability.

142
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,520
And the condition for its
activation has been met.

143
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,220
Time to show you my third power!

144
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,480
Activate!

145
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,240
It isn't flying away...

146
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,650
Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?

147
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,520
Exactly.

148
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,380
This is my third power, God's Accomplice.

149
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,160
While Perfect Plan is active, it allows
anyone I touch to use it, as well.

150
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,990
Do you understand how powerful
this technique is now?

151
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,680
This power will let us approach
and attack the enemy...

152
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,170
without their knowledge.

153
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,830
The King's strength doesn't matter...

154
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,380
If we can sneak up and use a powerful
attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win.

155
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,370
Hey, Gon...

156
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,020
You're the partner I've been looking for.

157
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,650
The perfect guy to smack the King

158
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,600
with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!

159
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,300
I was watching

160
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.

161
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,130
Those were my soldiers.

162
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,260
I sent them to attack, so I could
measure your strength,

163
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,320
but they...

164
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,540
Ah, no need to feel bad...

165
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,480
They were killing for sport when
I wasn't paying attention.

166
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,110
They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies.

167
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,780
Well, from their perspective,
I'm the one who's changed.

168
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,390
What you said about being your partner...

169
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,120
There's someone who'd be better than me.

170
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,650
You know someone?

171
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,950
Yep.

172
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,750
I'll contact him.

173
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,770
Hold on.

174
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,360
I trust you.

175
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,150
And even if you end up turning on me,
I won't blame you or regret my decision.

176
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,950
Because I watched you, spoke to you,
and decided to trust you.

177
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,610
But I'm not about to trust others
just because you trust them.

178
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,020
Do you understand?

179
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,160
I get your point, but...

180
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,030
My life is on the line here.

181
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,550
Listen to me.

182
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,820
Perfect Plan is not invincible.

183
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,790
In fact, it's highly vulnerable.

184
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,760
I can make people ignore my existence,

185
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,450
but I'm still right there in the same place.
They just don't notice me.

186
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,800
So their attacks can still hit me.

187
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,680
Knowing there's a person around with
my ability, what would someone do?

188
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,160
They'd launch attacks in every direction.

189
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,690
Oh, you're right...

190
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,730
If one of those attacks hits me,
even by dumb luck, I'm done for.

191
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,130
I hate to admit it,

192
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,700
but when it comes to combat,
I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around.

193
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,710
I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.

194
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,960
Forget the King...

195
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,200
I couldn't even survive a punch
from a Squadron Leader.

196
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,640
If I just turn invisible,
others can locate me with En.

197
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,710
It's been tested, so the other
Squadron Leaders know this, too.

198
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,830
I need my enemies to believe
my power to be weak.

199
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,640
They need to think En is enough to beat it.

200
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,390
This ability is only invincible
if no one knows about it.

201
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Enough explaining...

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,010
My point is that I don't want to
reveal my power to any others!

203
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,110
Not even if it's someone you trust.

204
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,230
You can see for yourself, then.

205
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,160
I'll call him out here without mentioning you.

206
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,750
W-Wait...

207
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,990
You can watch from a distance.

208
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,380
Hello—

209
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,350
Yo! I've been waiting, fool!

210
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,770
You pulled a fast one! Where are you?

211
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,250
I've got lots of questions for you.

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,750
Because of you kids, the boss
had to make a move...

213
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,020
The plan's been derailed,
but I support what you're doing.

214
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,800
Letting five million die isn't right.

215
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,950
The boss used his power to surround the capital.

216
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,170
Really?

217
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,770
That should make it harder for Neferpitou
to control puppets remotely.

218
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,020
In other words, they can't perform
the selection from a distance.

219
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,040
Right.

220
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,270
But the boss and Knov-san will be expending
all their energy to delay Neferpitou.

221
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,850
Which means, when the operation starts,

222
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,640
they won't be in any condition to
take on any of the Royal Guard.

223
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,210
We expect more citizens to gather
in the capital for the celebration.

224
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,030
There may be a massacre yet.

225
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,540
The situation's still grim...

226
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,870
We can longer contact the Chairman.

227
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,250
He's holed up somewhere until the last
possible minute, preparing for the final battle.

228
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,600
We four need to make a decision.

229
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,140
Do we summon reinforcements, or do we
face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?

230
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,460
I'd like to know Killua's opinion.

231
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,470
He isn't here.

232
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,040
What? You split up?

233
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,440
I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.

234
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,150
Can you call him real quick?

235
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,150
No luck. He isn't picking up...

236
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,290
I think his is off.

237
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,920
Really? Well, keep trying.

238
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,710
We should meet up, the sooner the better.

239
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,570
Yeah.

240
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,690
Let's find a halfway point to meet.

241
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,360
Here... Mandai City.

242
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,470
Okay, got it.

243
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,320
Checkmate.

244
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,390
You're done.

245
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,080
Why didn't you resign?

246
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,850
Don't make me repeat myself.

247
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,350
The match ended twenty-two moves ago.

248
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,100
Why did you not resign then?

249
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,480
Did you believe I would make a mistake?

250
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,890
Idiot.

251
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,730
Next, we have the national Go champion.

252
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,550
Give me the rulebook.

253
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,300
It may look simple at first,
but it is a complex game.

254
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,660
It may take more time to learn than shogi.

255
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,470
Please let me leave!

256
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,700
What do you want?

257
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,470
Someone! Help me!

258
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,900
My glasses...

259
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,990
Silence.

260
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,620
You are in the King's presence.

261
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,180
The choice is yours.

262
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,430
Sit across from me now.

263
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,680
Or die.

264
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,390
5.5 points.

265
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,820
The King wins.

266
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,540
I-It only took him ten games?

267
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm t-tired!

268
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,680
It's the only explanation for that loss!

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,540
And I think I have a fever.

270
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm short on sleep.

271
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,460
And I feel dizzy...

272
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,620
I'll give you eight hours.

273
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,420
And any medicine you need.

274
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,930
I expect you to be in top condition.

275
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,250
Should you lose again, I won't
be interested in excuses.

276
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,140
Rest as if your life depends on it.

277
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,950
I'm impressed by how quickly
you learn these games.

278
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,540
I didn't expect that this would
take half the time as shogi.

279
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,260
It's all about learning the feel.

280
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,200
Chess, Go, shogi...

281
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,650
They have different rules, but all three

282
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,620
have a certain rhythm to their moves.

283
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,170
That means disrupting your
opponent's rhythm is crucial.

284
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,630
Once you've learned the openings,
you can deduce your opponent's rhythm.

285
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,390
Once you know their rhythm,
you need only disrupt it.

286
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,890
That principle would apply to any contest.

287
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,220
If you've already reached that conclusion,
I don't see the benefit of playing more games.

288
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,600
They will only bore you.

289
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,950
How many remain?

290
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,110
This country has one more professional game.

291
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,700
It's a board game called Gungi.

292
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,870
Gungi.

293
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,990
The game originated in East Gorteau,

294
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,130
and nearly all citizens know how to play.

295
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,050
Give me the rulebook.

296
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,900
As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king.

297
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,430
But you can stack up to three pieces.

298
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,770
At the start, you may also freely place
your pieces within a restricted area.

299
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,080
The game has a different feel

300
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,780
due to the addition of a third dimension.

301
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,810
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,

302
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,630
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.

303
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,790
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.

304
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,040
Then, if I win, I'll be the best in the world?

305
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,140
A fitting way to end this recreation.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,020
Let us begin.

307
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,560
There are six days until the selection.

308
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,580
The King has no idea

309
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,580
how this girl is about to influence his fate.

310
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,960
Next time: Check x And x Mate.

311
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,940
I'm Gon.

312
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm Gillua.

313
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,290
Did you change your name?

314
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,370
No way.

315
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,340
Say it again.

316
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm Gillua!

317
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,430
GG!
