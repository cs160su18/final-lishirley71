2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,900
Tell the boss...

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,650
I won't go back until I settle up

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,540
with that chain user.

5
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,030
Chasing x And x Waiting

6
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,290
Hisoka, who joined the Phantom Troupe

7
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,040
for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo,

8
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,040
has proposed that Kurapika,
who seeks revenge

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,260
on the Troupe, join forces with him.

10
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,540
Well? It's your call.

11
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,800
Will you work with me?

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,150
Or will you fight alone?

13
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,270
Go ahead.

14
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,300
It's me.

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,830
Kurapika, it's terrible...

16
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,080
The man we captured has escaped.

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,200
Escaped? On his own?

18
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,520
No,

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
some Troupe members

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,010
disguised themselves as
Mafia and came for him.

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
What about the leader?

22
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,210
We've been unable to reach him.

23
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,700
We're heading toward pattern B.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,290
Return immediately.

25
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,610
I understand.

26
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,100
Hisoka, I have a question for you.

27
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,180
Do you know what became
of the Scarlet Eyes?

28
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,610
Unfortunately, that was
from before I joined.

29
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,180
The boss sells every item after
admiring it for a while.

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,280
The Scarlet Eyes should be no exception.

31
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,720
That is all I know.

32
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,200
But keep this in mind.

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,870
A spider will not stop moving
until you crush its head.

34
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,780
I asked if you wanted to team up,

35
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,980
but I was not suggesting that
we fight side by side.

36
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,070
Merely that we exchange information,
in a give-and-take relationship.

37
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,610
If it ceases to be beneficial to either party,

38
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,820
there will be no further
obligation to cooperate.

39
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,300
Simple enough, yes?

40
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,920
What do you say?

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll be here tomorrow,
at the same time.

42
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,160
So, what do we do now?

43
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,560
The leader is probably dead.

44
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,420
And we haven't completed the mission...

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,540
Shouldn't we report this to the boss?

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,020
That little girl's our boss in name alone.

47
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,370
It was someone else who hired us.

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,550
Light Nostrade, her father.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,140
He gave the orders,

50
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,560
and the leader received them.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,150
But the leader was the only one
who knew how to contact him.

52
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,570
It seems we have no choice but to report
what's happened to the boss.

53
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,090
Boss... Boss.

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,340
What time is it?

55
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,090
It's 2 AM.

56
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,940
Huh? What about the auction?!

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,470
It's been called off.

58
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,470
Huh?

59
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,590
Called off? Why?

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,840
The auction was attacked by thieves.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,860
Huh?

62
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,500
Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino
died during the attack.

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,080
What?

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,540
We can't reach the leader,
so he's probably done for.

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,630
No way.

66
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,730
What about the mummy?

67
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,600
Was it really stolen?

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,430
I wanted it so much...

69
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,120
The Mafia community moved the
merchandise to a safe location.

70
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,960
Oh, that's great!

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
So when is the next auction?

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,470
We don't yet know.

73
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,120
What? Why not?

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,620
In any event, the leader
handled all communication,

75
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,390
so we don't know anything.

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,990
We cannot act until we have orders.

77
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,640
I don't know anything about that.

78
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,830
So, ask Daddy.

79
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,100
His number's on my phone.

80
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,270
Squala, make the call.

81
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,110
Huh? Why me?!

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,270
You're the most experienced member left.

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,170
You should be the leader.

84
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,990
No way!

85
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,990
Out of the question!

86
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm not the leader type.

87
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,250
Perhaps we should take a vote, to be fair?

88
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,370
We need to make the call quickly.

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,500
I vote for Kurapika.

90
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,370
He was the one who
apprehended the bandit,

91
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,580
and he has shown excellent judgment.

92
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,010
I believe he would make the best leader.

93
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,290
No objections here.
I vote for Kurapika.

94
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,540
That's that...

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,980
You make the call.

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,340
I understand.

97
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,620
As the interim leader,
I'll call Mr. Nostrade.

98
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,990
This is only until we confirm
what's become of Dalzollene.

99
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,840
Any final decision will be
Mr. Nostrade's to make.

100
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,010
I never expected to get
a chance so soon...

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,180
It would be inappropriate for
me to call him directly,

102
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,470
so would you provide an
introduction, boss?

103
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,020
Sure.

104
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,900
Then, I'm putting him on now.

105
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,700
Hello?

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,560
Is it true that Dalzollene has been killed?

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,630
Yes.

108
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,720
I find that hard to believe.

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,310
He is a Nen user.

110
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,970
He's trained to withstand

111
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,890
ten gunshots without sustaining injury.

112
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,740
He was killed by a group of outlaws
known as the Phantom Troupe.

113
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,100
The spiders?

114
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,610
I had an opportunity to see them in action.

115
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,210
One of them stopped a
bazooka rocket with one hand.

116
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,620
I am Kurapika, the interim leader.

117
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,710
Could you please issue us our orders?

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,530
First, I'd like to hear your
opinion as interim leader.

119
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,520
I believe we should

120
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,780
get your daughter out of
Yorknew City immediately.

121
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,120
If anything unexpected happens,

122
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,310
we would be unable to protect her.

123
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,260
I agree with your assessment,
but my daughter also has a say.

124
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,800
I want to respect her wishes when possible.

125
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,240
My top priority is her safety.

126
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,650
I understand.

127
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,850
I'm on my way now.

128
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,660
I should arrive by tomorrow evening.

129
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,750
I shall do my best to persuade Neon.

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,040
You will be the new leader, Kurapika.

131
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,390
Here is your first order.

132
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,720
Keep an eye on Neon until I arrive.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,930
Understood.

134
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,790
Your father will arrive tomorrow night.

135
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,840
Really?

136
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,890
Yay!

137
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,270
I'll get him to buy me lots of clothes.

138
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,520
You are to wait in your room until then.

139
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,180
What?

140
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,900
I want to see the casino...

141
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,130
Stay here with the boss.

142
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,920
Huh?

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,220
S-Sure...

144
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,700
I'll be downstairs, investigating.

145
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,310
Here we go!

146
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,470
That building you were in is owned by

147
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,980
a dummy corporation for
the Nostrade Family.

148
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,940
Can you get a list of buildings

149
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,030
the Nostrade Family owns in this area?

150
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,130
Of course!

151
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,950
I can also see if anyone's checked
in using the Nostrade name.

152
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,080
Here, I brought more beer.

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Oh, thanks.

154
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,850
Here.

155
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,380
You should get a Hunter License, Uvo.

156
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,530
You can get all kinds of
information from this website,

157
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,350
as long as you have the money.

158
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,670
Unlike you guys, I dislike
the idea of money.

159
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,670
If there's something I want, I take it.

160
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,810
How splendid...

161
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,360
You are the model thief!

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,860
Here we go.

163
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
They own two other buildings.

164
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,020
And there are three hotels
where members are staying...

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,230
Well, this should be a short search.

166
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,370
Thanks.

167
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,290
I appreciate it.

168
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,380
Wh-What was that for?!

169
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,110
Well, I'm off, then.

170
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,080
What about the beer?

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,760
You guys can finish it.

172
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,260
Make sure you dispose of the body.

173
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,420
Try to make it quick.

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah.

175
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,250
Bye.

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,020
Uvo!

177
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,020
Huh?

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Don't get careless.

179
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,540
Family members?

181
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,190
I'll start with them.

182
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,290
Look at this.

183
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,740
What's that?

184
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,010
A list of buildings owned
by the Nostrade Family?

185
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,210
There's a list of Family members...

186
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,300
I didn't know this information was available.

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,990
This website can only be
accessed by pro Hunters.

188
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,250
With this information,
they can locate this room.

189
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,420
A website for pro Hunters...

190
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,190
Then if one of the enemies is a pro Hunter...

191
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,920
We're in big trouble.

192
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,200
We need to take the boss
and find a different room.

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,830
Eh? In the same hotel?

194
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,200
It's faster and avoids needless movement.

195
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,820
But we cannot use fake names.

196
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,340
We'll have Melody or Basho register the room.

197
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,050
Make sure everyone,
especially the boss, stays inside.

198
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,070
Got it.

199
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,660
Don't check out of this one.

200
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Kurapika? What about you?

201
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,720
I'll stay here.

202
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,520
Huh?

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,230
You can't mean to...

204
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,570
I-I don't think that's a Family member.

205
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,260
He's a bodyguard for the boss' daughter...

206
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,080
Daughter?

207
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,400
Yeah...

208
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,840
She's a strange one who
collects human body parts.

209
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,070
Eyeballs and organs...

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,220
Oh, and she's an incredibly
accurate fortune teller.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,590
Fortune teller?

212
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,640
She has a long list of Mafia clients...

213
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,780
Some community elders basically worship her.

214
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,640
After all, our boss

215
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,120
made his fortune by using
his daughter's power.

216
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,780
Hey...

217
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,290
C-Cut me some slack?

218
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,640
I told you everything I know.

219
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,480
Please spare me!

220
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,370
Someone who can see the future...

221
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,620
She knew the attack would happen?

222
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,910
The boss was right.

223
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,940
There weren't any traitors.

224
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
Currently, we have a 3,000,000 diamond

225
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,220
and 2,400,000 Jenny in leftover cash.

226
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,390
And we also have the 2,750,000
Jenny from the arm wrestling.

227
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,150
That gives us a total of around 8,000,000.

228
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,710
We need to turn this into at least 9 billion,

229
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,420
the minimum opening bid for Greed Island...

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,410
I don't see how we can manage that
through legitimate channels.

231
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,730
I wouldn't call that arm wrestling legitimate.

232
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,920
All the challengers toward the end were
half desperate losers trying for revenge.

233
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,920
That's fine.
That was my goal.

234
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,890
Huh?

235
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,500
We want as many people as
possible to embellish the tale.

236
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,930
What do you mean?

237
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,340
The arm wrestling was meant as bait.

238
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,580
Bait?

239
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,430
To draw out the moles.

240
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,990
Moles? Why do we want moles?

241
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,330
Pipe down now.
I'll explain everything.

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,950
Come on down!

243
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,110
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!

244
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,370
We have a diamond worth 3,000,000.

245
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,830
The winner will be determined
through arm wrestling.

246
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,920
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.

247
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,880
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.

248
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,150
What? He's just a kid.

249
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll give it a shot.

250
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't bother.

251
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,760
That kid beat five hundred people yesterday.

252
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,040
Huh?

253
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,400
Over twenty ended up with broken arms.

254
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,810
Seriously?!

255
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,580
The stories are spreading nicely.

256
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,880
In that case...

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,370
Move.

258
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,540
Oh, do we have our first challenger?

259
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,760
No.

260
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,510
Huh?

261
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,040
I already know that my man
can't beat your kid.

262
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,510
I was watching yesterday.

263
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,810
Then what do you want?

264
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,920
Interested in making some real money?

265
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,540
Meaning?

266
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,410
I know where you can make big bucks

267
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,550
instead of the pocket change
you're getting here.

268
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,640
You can make hundreds...

269
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,100
No, thousands of times more.

270
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,590
Are they moles?

271
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,710
Yeah, looks like we landed a big fish.

272
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,130
Huh? Fish?

273
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,460
Don't you mean moles?

274
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,200
Stop talking.
It doesn't matter!

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,580
Here we are.

276
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,780
Oh! I can feel the bloodlust.

277
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,730
The arm wrestling competition here
accepts all comers, and it pays out.

278
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,080
The spectators bet on each match,

279
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,130
and the winner receives ten
percent of all bets placed.

280
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,000
We're talking billions bet on each match.

281
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,870
That would mean millions with each win!

282
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,940
You could win even more...

283
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,620
I'll be taking fifty percent of your
earnings as my commission.

284
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,340
Fifty percent? Isn't that a little high?

285
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,730
You can't participate
unless I enter your name.

286
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,840
Besides, you can bet your own money.

287
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,670
You'll get great odds with that kid,

288
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,810
and earn back your stake
a hundred times over.

289
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,060
That's right! I'm in!

290
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,460
Go, Gon!

291
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,480
Huh?

292
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,780
Well? Any other challengers?

293
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,180
Got one right here!

294
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,490
This kid's up for the challenge.

295
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,680
Very well.

296
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,350
Sorry, but the arm wrestling is canceled!

297
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,920
We'll be doing some
conditional auctioning now!

298
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,300
Why was it canceled?

299
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,510
U-Uh, I don't know.

300
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,010
To win, you must play
hide-and-seek!

301
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,360
Hide-and-seek?

302
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,110
We'll start by passing out flyers!

303
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,650
Examine the pictures on the flyer.

304
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,410
Those seven people are your targets!

305
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,390
Hey, that girl with glasses was...

306
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,160
Yep, she arm wrestled me.

307
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,900
Hey, are they the ones responsible
for what happened last night?

308
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,470
Yeah, you mean the attack on the auction?

309
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,830
In order to win the bid,

310
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,430
you must capture and deliver a target to us.

311
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,960
For each target brought in,

312
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,810
you will receive a nice sum of 2 billion Jenny!

313
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,790
There is no time limit.

314
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,220
It doesn't matter if the
target is dead or alive.

315
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,190
Please contact us once
you've captured one!

316
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,350
Two billion each?

317
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,200
If we catch them all, we'd have 14 billion!

318
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,080
It'll cost you 5 million Jenny to participate!

319
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,420
We're joining in, right?

320
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,400
Yeah...

321
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,450
Yeah, that's right.
I'll fax you the information.

322
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,090
Search the Net for information.

323
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,020
We'll pay for anything concrete.

324
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,580
We need to hurry.

325
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,080
There's no rush.

326
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,850
They won't be able to catch our targets.

327
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,130
Huh?

328
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,750
After all, the Mafia's having
trouble handling them.

329
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,360
What do you mean?

330
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,890
This conditional auction is
nothing but a bounty hunt.

331
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,940
In other words,

332
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,490
the Mafia is admitting that, alone,
it can't capture these targets.

333
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,730
You have a point...

334
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,000
They were willing to suspend
everything to track them down.

335
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,500
I just heard that the underground
auction was attacked last night.

336
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,480
The underground auction?!

337
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,260
Was it them?

338
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,010
That's why there's a
reward for their heads?

339
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,720
Yep, they must be nuts to
steal from the Mafia.

340
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,520
And we already know who would
be crazy enough for that.

341
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,030
The Phantom Troupe!

342
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,880
Oh, right...

343
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
What's Kurapika up to?

344
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,430
Yeah, he should be in the city,

345
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,810
but he hasn't made contact.

346
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,790
I'll call him.

347
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,370
He isn't answering.

348
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,840
Is he working?

349
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,970
Working?

350
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,320
I heard that he's been
working as a bodyguard.

351
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,280
Probably for some VIP...

352
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,000
He's trying to track down the Scarlet Eyes,

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,330
so it must be someone in the underworld.

354
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,500
What if he was guarding that
person at the auction house,

355
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,460
and got caught up in the attack?

356
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,250
He wouldn't have been
caught up in the attack.

357
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,560
If the Troupe attacked, he'd be
actively tracking them down.

358
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,470
It's possible that he's already
captured two or three.

359
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,860
I hope you're right...

360
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,310
Alone?

361
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,580
I'm impressed.

362
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,570
Where do you want to die?

363
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,620
I'll humor any requests.

364
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,720
I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,
with no one nearby.

365
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,160
Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.

366
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,510
Uvogin has come to avenge his
capture and restore his pride.

367
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,540
And Kurapika has been waiting

368
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,210
for the chance to exact revenge
upon the Phantom Troupe.

369
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,500
Their battle is about to start.

370
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

371
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

372
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

373
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

374
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

375
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

376
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

377
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

378
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:19,460
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

379
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,230
Today, we introduce Squala.

380
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,990
One of Neon's bodyguards.

381
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,570
He's one of Neon's bodyguards!

382
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,410
He can control dogs with Nen.

383
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,460
A Manipulator who
controls his pet dogs.

384
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,300
He's a Manipulator.

385
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,230
He's actually dating Eliza-san, Neon's maid.

386
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,840
Meow!

387
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,790
Woof!

388
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,420
Next time: Condition x And x Condition.

389
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Explain the difference in thirty words.

390
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,840
A condition is a rule.

391
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,260
A condition is a covenant with yourself!
