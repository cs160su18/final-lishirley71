2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,980
They're coming.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,980
They are definitely coming!

4
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,030
Defend x And x Attack

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,820
September 1st.

6
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,440
The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,940
had chosen to reunite in Yorknew City.

8
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,040
On this morning, Gon and Killua

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,320
were visiting the Yorknew market.

10
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,660
Wow, there are so many people!

11
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,070
But this market's purpose

12
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,300
is to swindle people who
have come for the auction.

13
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,140
What?

14
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,290
This isn't the auction venue?

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,790
Obviously.

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,680
Yorknew's dream auction

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,190
is held once a year in the
world's largest auction house.

18
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,030
They say that, just during the
ten days of official bidding,

19
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,940
tens of trillions of Jenny exchange hands.

20
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,060
Tens of trillions?

21
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,370
Yeah, an item sold for ten thousand

22
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,570
can be turned around for a
hundred million the next day.

23
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,490
You can make a fortune instantly.

24
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,870
It's where dreams come true.

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,330
Wow...

26
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,310
Well, that's why a lot

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,420
of underworld auctioning
happens at the same time.

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,090
That's awesome...

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,310
Anyway, do you think Kurapika
and Leorio will show up?

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,290
They promised to meet us here.

31
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm sure they'll come.

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,080
Yeah.

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,220
They might try to contact us.

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,220
Hey, you have to buy a phone!

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,670
It's standard Hunter gear.

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,280
Ah, that's true.

37
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,360
Hey! Welcome!

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,880
This one's great...

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,460
It's the hottest current model!

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,420
Super-thin and no bigger than a credit card.

41
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,370
It has GPS, which comes in
handy for meeting with people.

42
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't bother.

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,370
Hmm?

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,630
That feature doesn't work in many countries,

45
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,180
and it isn't even waterproof.

46
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,630
That model is for people
who only make calls.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,790
Leorio!

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,790
Yo!

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,100
I would recommend...

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,800
this Beetle 07.

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,510
It's a little heavy and pricey,

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,420
but it includes a translator for the
two hundred languages used worldwide.

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,870
What? Seriously?

54
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,760
Go with this one.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,550
I'll buy one, too!

56
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,310
Yeah!

57
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Two, please.

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,320
Two will cost four hundred thousand.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
Four hundred thousand?

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,290
That's expensive, pops!

61
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,820
Thanks, Leorio!

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,640
But, damn, 110,580 Jenny apiece, huh?

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,180
It's a new model, so that's a
fair price in this market.

64
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,610
Still, talk about overkill.

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,790
I've never seen

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,960
a cell phone purchase greeted
with applause before.

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,830
But you really saved us.

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,610
Just so you know, that was nothing.

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,850
The serious dealing only starts
when the seller tells you to leave.

70
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,620
He's the last person you
would find at an auction.

71
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,640
No kidding.

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,170
So how are you guys doing?

73
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,290
What do you mean?

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,040
You've trained and gotten stronger, right?

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,980
What?!

76
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,260
You returned the tag to
Hisoka at Heavens Arena?

77
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,410
And you have to be pretty good
to make it to the 200s...

78
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,400
How strong have you gotten now?

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,290
Hey, did you learn Nen, Leorio?

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, you bet.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,380
Awesome!

82
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,470
Really?

83
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,910
Why would I lie to you?

84
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,330
It's the ability to build up a shroud
of aura, one's own life force...

85
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,510
That's Ten,

86
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,520
one of the four major
principles for learning Nen.

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,980
Eh? There's more to it?

88
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,490
Figured as much.

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,780
Greed Island ? What's that?

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,780
A legendary game.

91
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,710
We're trying to get a copy at the auction.

92
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,530
But why a game?

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,910
I think this game holds a
clue to finding my dad.

94
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,900
Huh?

95
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,190
The game holds a clue to finding your dad?

96
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,470
What do you mean?

97
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,890
Well, it's a long story.

98
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,200
Anyway, the problem is the cost.

99
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,180
How much are we talking?

100
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,300
The lowest starting bid is

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,050
8.9 billion Jenny.

102
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,980
8.9 billion?!

103
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,310
How much do you have?

104
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,920
We made some bad investments,

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,310
so we're down to 5 million.

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,470
Listen up, kids...

107
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,430
This event is held at Southern Piece,
the world's finest auction house.

108
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,640
The money you have won't
cover the entry fee.

109
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,650
But the game has a low difficulty rank
on the Hunter site's treasure list.

110
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,450
Really?

111
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,260
Because you only need
money to get a copy.

112
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,330
It always comes back to money.

113
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,990
This world runs on money!

114
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,210
Well...

115
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,670
That just means that a real
treasure can't be bought.

116
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,130
If you can't obtain an item
like this with ease,

117
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,180
you can't be considered
a pro Hunter, right?

118
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't need you to tell me that.

119
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,270
But first, we need money...

120
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,240
We'll need some starting funds.

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,180
Let's find a way to make
some money in Yorknew!

122
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,030
Yeah!

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,090
A simple fool.

124
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,950
Leorio's probably also an Enhancer.

125
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,450
Damn! What's wrong?!

126
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,330
I created a complete
duplicate of the program.

127
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,080
Why aren't any events being triggered?

128
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,210
Did Kil somehow trick me?

129
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,340
No... No way.

130
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,850
He isn't capable of creating a fake game,

131
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,770
and he's not stupid enough
to lie over a deal.

132
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,310
Was he tricked when he
obtained this card?

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,300
I want to know the answer.

134
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll do whatever it takes to
uncover this secret...

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,060
No matter how much I have to pay.

136
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,690
I have 12.7 billion left.

137
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,200
I'll need at least twice that amount

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,510
to guarantee a winning bid...

139
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,690
Dad, I want to make a deal.

140
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,820
I'll kill fifteen people,
so lend me 15 billion.

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,370
Got it.

142
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,400
Bye.

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,780
Autopilot engaged to Lingon Airport.

144
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,620
I think I was ten...

145
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,390
The last time I went outside.

146
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,600
Huh? Swap?

147
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
What does that mean?

148
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,260
"Swap."

149
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,010
An auction technique.

150
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,960
Slang for the exchange of goods.

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
Also see "Bind."

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,120
What's a bind?

153
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,270
"Bind."

154
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,890
The seller names a condition
besides money as their price.

155
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,170
The winning bid will be the
one that comes closest

156
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,950
to meeting that condition.

157
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,250
Condition?

158
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,750
No idea what that means.

159
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,720
So that's it...

160
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
There's another kind of auctioning...

161
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,400
Tonight, at 9 PM,

162
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,090
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.

163
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,340
Ivlenkov,

164
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Tocino,

165
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,350
and Baise,

166
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,070
you'll handle the bidding.

167
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,120
Will three people be enough?

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,700
Each group of bidders
is limited to three people.

169
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,230
You cannot bring weapons,
recorders, or communication devices.

170
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:35,240
All on-site security is handled by
the Mafia that runs the auction,

171
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,940
so there's rarely any trouble.

172
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,890
All it takes is one wrong move

173
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,120
to turn every Mafia member,
worldwide, against you.

174
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,750
This auction is built on trust.

175
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,070
Which is why the Mafia don't
use security cameras.

176
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,190
The unspoken rule is that

177
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,140
any grudges and the like are left outside.

178
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Which means

179
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,130
that if anything does happen,

180
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,310
their testimony will decide everything.

181
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,520
Their words are treated as gospel.

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,660
So it's imperative to make
a good impression.

183
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't start any petty fights.

184
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,910
Avoid talking to anyone
outside this group.

185
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
What about the rest of us?

186
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,410
Basho and Linssen

187
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,910
will cover the rear entrance.

188
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,920
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.

189
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,320
Squala and I will guard the lady.

190
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,050
And with that,

191
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,720
the mission begins.

192
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,140
Come on down!

193
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,600
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!

194
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,390
Here's what's up for bid.

195
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,150
A diamond worth three million.

196
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,530
Comes with the appraisal of the
store where I just bought it.

197
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,420
Arm wrestling will decide the winning bid.

198
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,530
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.

199
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,040
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.

200
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,040
Now, let's start

201
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
the auction!

202
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,780
Yeah! It's mine!

203
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm in!

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,960
Count me in!

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,460
Okay, don't push...

206
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,980
Form a line.

207
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,160
Adjust your strength to
match the opponent.

208
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,430
Every now and then,
pretend to be struggling.

209
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,360
Okay, you're first!

210
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,600
You need to pay the entry fee up front.

211
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,350
Here you go... 10,000 Jenny.

212
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,440
Thank you, step right up!

213
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,780
Okay, clasp hands.

214
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,160
Just follow my instructions.

215
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,920
Are you ready?

216
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,580
You get a single round!

217
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,080
Ready...

218
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,040
Go!

219
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,690
Uh-oh!

220
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,470
Will he do it?

221
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,030
You almost have it...

222
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,540
Hang in there!

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,770
Oh, so close!

224
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,160
Damn, I lost to a little kid...

225
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,660
Next, please.

226
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,590
Ready... Go!

227
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,670
I get it.

228
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,240
So this is how conditional
auctioning works.

229
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,920
But to reach 8.9 billion,

230
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,700
we're going to need 889,999 wins.

231
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,460
Damn...

232
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,920
And you lose!

233
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,430
Next, please.

234
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,580
You lose!

235
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,030
He's beaten a hundred and fifty people!

236
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,220
He's gotta be running out of steam.

237
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,780
He looks tired,
and he's sweating hard.

238
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,820
Don't lose before I get my turn!

239
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,250
I feel bad about tricking everyone.

240
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,710
I'm even breaking out in a cold sweat

241
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,330
at the idea of making so
much money so easily.

242
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,900
Okay, next person, please.

243
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,990
Well, we have our first
female challenger!

244
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,840
All right! Get him, girl!

245
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,420
Go easy on her, muscle boy!

246
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,590
How old are you?

247
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,350
Where are you from?

248
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,350
Huh? You're no fun.

249
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,460
Let's have a fair contest.

250
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,310
Oh, yes.

251
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,900
Ready... Go!

252
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,580
Oh, too bad! You lose!

253
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,980
Good job, girl!

254
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank you very much.

255
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,470
Oh, you're welcome.

256
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,990
A pity.

257
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,210
That was your full strength, wasn't it?

258
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,910
Yeah...

259
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,210
I wonder who she is...

260
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,990
The world champion arm wrestler?

261
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,670
Well?

262
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,150
I lost.

263
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,610
He's strong.

264
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,450
That little boy?

265
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,170
I sort of wanted that diamond.

266
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,430
You should've used your left hand.

267
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,180
Yes, why didn't you use
your stronger hand?

268
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,840
Oh, right...

269
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,460
He extended his right hand,
so I did the same.

270
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,190
I'd like to challenge him again.

271
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,370
You can't.

272
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,380
No time. We have our job.

273
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,780
Yes.

274
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,440
Besides, buying and
bidding would be wrong.

275
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,690
We're thieves.

276
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,450
If we want something, we take it.

277
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,780
No way! I'm going!

278
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,690
Can you hear me?
I'm ready to give up...

279
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes, her tantrum—

280
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,900
That is, her crying exhausted her,
and she's asleep now.

281
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,460
I don't know what will
happen when she wakes.

282
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,160
I vow to obtain the items she desires,

283
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,920
but her goal is to participate
in the bidding personally.

284
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,650
So she'll be disappointed

285
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,930
when she wakes up and realizes
that she missed her chance.

286
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,740
Very well.

287
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,060
I'll adjust my schedule and
head over personally.

288
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,540
For now, just be sure to get
that mummy princess,

289
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,440
so we can get Neon in a good mood again.

290
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,490
Understood.

291
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,200
It's me. How's it going?

292
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,450
Nothing unusual.

293
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,110
No changes visible from the outside.

294
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Understood.

295
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,770
We'll notify you if anything happens.

296
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,910
Still, they're being quite thorough.

297
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,400
Only Mafia security are allowed

298
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,420
within five hundred meters
of the auction house.

299
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,600
If they didn't do that, the surroundings
would be crawling with thugs.

300
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,390
They're practically announcing that
unwholesome practices are going on.

301
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,980
I suppose so.

302
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,850
Will the Phantom Troupe

303
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,740
really show up?

304
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,490
Hmm?

305
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,740
That's the same sound I heard earlier.

306
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,120
You see,

307
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,500
I happened to see you
leaving the Hunter agency.

308
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,010
When you walked past me,

309
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,820
your heart was playing a melody of rage.

310
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,080
May I ask you a question?

311
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,010
Yes.

312
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,940
Scarlet eyes.

313
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,980
Exactly what...

314
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,520
do they mean to you?

315
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,280
Why do you ask?

316
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,100
No real reason.

317
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,020
Curiosity?

318
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,540
When you saw the image
on the data card,

319
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,470
your heartbeat was even more fearsome.

320
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,330
It played a melody of boundless fury.

321
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,250
I suppose that I can't lie...

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,660
I am a Kurta.

323
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,090
Our eyes are normally brown,

324
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,330
but they're red when we're excited.

325
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,310
So I wear black contacts
to avoid discovery.

326
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,220
I am searching

327
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,910
for the eyes taken from my brethren.

328
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,080
I'll do whatever it takes to
return their eyes to them.

329
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,090
Will you report this to Dalzollene?

330
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,200
I will not.

331
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,190
I do not wish to be killed.

332
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,290
You could read my intention?

333
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,440
A heartbeat is always honest.

334
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,840
When you began to confess
your true nature to me,

335
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
your heartbeat was calm, but frigid.

336
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,810
The heartbeat of one

337
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,710
who is prepared to kill.

338
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,860
Your heart said that, though you would hold
no grudges, I was fair game if I talked.

339
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,400
Why did you take this job?

340
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,860
Why do you ask?

341
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,410
I'll probably lie.

342
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,630
I'll know if you're lying by your eyes.

343
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm also a pro Hunter...

344
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,140
A Music Hunter, I suppose.

345
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,140
I'm looking for a certain musical score.

346
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,810
You aren't lying,

347
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,080
but you are concealing
something important.

348
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,900
Well, let's just say that you're correct.

349
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,910
I'm looking for the Dark Sonata.

350
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,070
A solo said to have been
composed by the devil.

351
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,380
There are four versions...
For the piano, violin, flute, and harp.

352
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,610
If a human plays or listens to the piece,

353
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,460
it's said that disaster will befall them.

354
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,210
Isn't that just a myth?

355
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,110
I doubt something like that
could exist in reality.

356
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,970
I've heard the flute version.

357
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,210
One movement alone turned me into this.

358
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,210
My friend who played the piece died,
their entire body like this.

359
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,420
That friend learned a single
movement from someone

360
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,240
who said never to play the music.

361
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,970
That day,

362
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,950
we were drunk and giddy.

363
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,870
My body was destroyed, but I
gained this ability in return.

364
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,860
However, I wish to restore my body.

365
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,950
I'm willing to do anything.

366
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,240
I don't want anyone else
to end up like me.

367
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,580
So I'll find the score and destroy it.

368
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,040
I chose this job because

369
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,410
it will be more efficient to
work from the underworld.

370
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,010
It's time.

371
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,830
The underworld auction is about to start.

372
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,510
It's time.

373
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,700
Yes.

374
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,660
The Phantom Troupe prepares
to bare its fangs.

375
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,860
How will Kurapika, now a
Nostrade Family bodyguard,

376
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,580
deal with them?

377
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

378
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

379
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

380
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

381
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

382
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

383
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

384
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,460
Hunterpedia!

385
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:19,420
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

386
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,240
Today, we introduce Basho!

387
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,780
A Hunter hired as one
of Neon's bodyguards.

388
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,700
Watch for his Great Haikuist technique,

389
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,250
which manifests any haiku he recites.

390
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,460
His hobby is writing haiku,
a form of poetry from his home.

391
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,440
I'll try one.

392
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,110
"This segment is a

393
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,640
test of the heart and soul."

394
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,670
Too many syllables!

395
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,590
Next time: A x Shocking x Tragedy.

396
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,260
Shocking!

397
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,760
Shocking?

398
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,350
Shocker!
