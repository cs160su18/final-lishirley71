2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,530
Don't worry.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,160
We aren't here to get in your way.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,030
In fact, you could say we're here to help.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,530
Help?

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,070
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,810
If we get the top score on
the quiz and win the card,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,040
we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,270
That's only five percent of your reward.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,050
It's a reasonable price, yeah?

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,510
Oh, right...

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,000
They haven't heard about Battera yet.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,810
Sure, if you get the top score.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,840
Everyone else is here for the chance
to sell us the final card, too?

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,750
With the game ending,

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,320
they're all hoping to share in the reward.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,310
It looks like they're going
to take the quiz in teams.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,500
What should we do?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,320
What? We should do it by ourselves.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Yeah.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,760
Whoever scores lower gets penalized.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,210
Okay, I'm in!

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,960
Honestly... They've got guts.

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,750
They just came from a fight to the death,

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,970
and now they're facing the final event
in the game with such confidence.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,430
I bet those two enjoyed this
game more than anyone.

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,150
Keep it up.

28
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,060
Ging's Friends x And x True Friends

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,440
The quiz contest open to all players has begun.

30
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,260
Then I will now start the quiz.

31
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,400
Question one.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,820
What is the name of the elder

33
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,980
who gives an important hint
about #1, Patch of Forest?

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,330
A: Hira.

35
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,730
B: Hida.

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,250
C: Hiso.

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,690
D: Mayu.

38
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,830
E: Hima.

39
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,040
Damn! I'm stumped on the first one!

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,240
Five choices?

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,050
What is the condition to obtain
#17, Breath of Archangel?

42
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,850
I caught the Bomber.

43
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,360
#84,

44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,290
Paladin's Necklace, is offered as a prize
in a monthly tournament of what?

45
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,620
Yes!

46
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,620
B. Rock-Paper-Scissors
C. Two-Man Tug-of-War
D. Snowball Fight
E. Kick the Can

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,170
Okay!

48
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,130
And now for the final question...

49
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,340
What is the name of card #0?

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,150
A: Ruler's Banquet.

51
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,180
B: Ruler's Invitation.

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,500
C: Ruler's Reception.

53
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,890
Can't remember...

54
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,890
C. Ruler's Reception
D. Ruler's Welcome
E. Ruler's Blessing

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,650
The quiz is over.

56
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,650
I will now announce the player with the top score.

57
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,510
With a score of 87 out of 100 points,

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,040
our top scoring player

59
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,830
is Gon.

60
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,940
Yes!

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,550
We have all one hundred!

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,990
You did it.

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,500
I hate to say it, but you beat us...

64
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,420
Congratulations.

65
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,560
Thanks.

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,410
That means Killua gets penalized.

67
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,500
Damn...

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,140
How many points did I get?

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,870
Ruler's Invitation?

70
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,580
Ruler's Invitation
An invitation from
this island's ruler.
The envelope contains
a map that shows the
castle and a badge.
Player must have badge
to enter the castle.

71
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,580
Looks like only the one with
the badge is invited.

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,030
So Limeiro is the capital?

73
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,680
I have to go alone?

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,770
We'll wait for you by the castle.

75
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,910
Hey, he really got it.

76
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,110
That kid really collected all the cards.

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,930
Hey, let's have a contest with
all your cards at stake.

78
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,000
Sorry, but you don't have a choice.

79
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,470
Then I'll take an Accompany card.

80
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,050
Wait, that won't work.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,070
We haven't been to Limeiro before.

82
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,480
So we should use Drift...

83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,640
Since we've been to the other cities before.

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,180
Drift
Transports you to a
previously unvisited city.
(If all cities have been
visited, Drift is used,
without transporting player.)
[SR][NORM]

85
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,890
In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro,

86
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,250
then come back for you guys.

87
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,190
Accompany will work after that.

88
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,310
Drift on!

89
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,990
Bingo!

90
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,370
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Let's go, Gon.

92
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,370
Yep.

93
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,780
Accompany on!

94
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Limeiro!

95
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,250
Those kids are amazing.

96
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,790
They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.

97
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,780
Of course...

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,350
They even defeated the bombers.

99
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,350
It's true,

100
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,240
those boys are much stronger
than when I first met them.

101
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,610
But they're still weaker than
Genthru in raw power.

102
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,820
They must have executed a brilliant plan...

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
Well, no matter.

104
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,610
I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.

105
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,410
Magnetic Force on.

106
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,730
Chrollo Lucilfer.

107
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll head back to reality and
make a fortune exorcising Nen.

108
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,290
I wonder what he's feeling.

109
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,380
What he's feeling?

110
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,270
He might meet Ging, after all.

111
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,380
The father he's been searching for all this time.

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,320
Welcome to Greed Island Castle.

113
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,880
Come in.

114
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,950
This place is a dump!

115
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,520
I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun.

116
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,650
Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!

117
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,710
I hear you're Ging's son?

118
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,150
Why don't you have a seat?

119
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh...

120
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,370
Where should I sit?

121
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,450
Isn't there any open space?

122
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,540
Clear some space, then...

123
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,790
Like this!

124
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,780
Uh...

125
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,990
Wait, where did I put it?

126
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,920
Oh! Here it is!

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,230
There you go.

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,180
Ruler's Blessing
Castle awarded to the
winner of the quiz.
Comes with capital city
(population 10,000).
The city's residents
will obey any laws or
commands you give.

129
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,270
Ruler's Blessing,

130
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,180
the reward for the top scorer.

131
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,720
How about it?!

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,450
Isn't it cool?

133
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,640
Are you amazed? Well?

134
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,410
There are 10,000 people in this city.

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,320
One of them could be...

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,430
Wait, did I get your hopes up?

137
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,360
Well?

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,820
Or were you just thinking that
Ging could be the ruler?

139
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,420
I was not!

140
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,080
I never considered that Ging might be here.

141
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,900
Oh, really now?

142
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,390
That's good, then...

143
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,040
Since he's not.

144
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,750
Dwun-san, can we get to business?

145
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,050
Oh, my bad.

146
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,250
Listen up.

147
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,530
You've collected all one hundred cards.

148
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,680
Which triggers a new event.

149
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,560
Hmm...

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,560
Oh, here it is!

151
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,430
This is it.

152
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,530
Open it up.

153
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,390
You can place three restricted
slot cards in this binder.

154
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,750
You can then take those three back
for use in the real world.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,590
However!

156
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,990
You cannot take multiple
copies of the same card.

157
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:14,490
You must choose three different restricted
slot cards from the hundred in your binder.

158
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,220
Okay, you've reached the ending...

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,570
Do you want the normal ending,
or the ending just for you?

160
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,100
Just for me?

161
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,820
Yep, that's right.

162
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
Which one do you want? Well?

163
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,940
Then I'll take the normal one.

164
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,110
Why would you choose that one?

165
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,300
I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's

166
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,860
the normal ending, my friends
can watch with me, right?

167
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,430
I see...

168
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,540
Dwun-san?

169
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,870
Huh?

170
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,900
Would you stop teasing him?

171
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm sorry...

172
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
There's no such thing as an ending just for you.

173
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
What? Really?

174
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,630
However, there's a message we've been told
to give you only after you beat the game.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,330
Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.

176
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm List.

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,340
He's Dwun.

178
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,400
As you probably know,
we're friends of your old man.

179
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,340
This game was created by Ging
and ten of his friends.

180
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,330
The name "Greed Island" was created

181
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,310
from the first letter in each of their names.

182
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,910
Your father was in charge,

183
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,020
so we wanted a word that began
with "G," and settled on "Greed."

184
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,300
Have you met Razor?

185
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,780
He's the "R," and I'm the "L."

186
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,860
The girl who explains the game at the start

187
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,610
is the twin of the girl you see
when leaving the island.

188
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,120
Eeta and Elena.

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Both names begin with "E."

190
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,240
And then, we have "D"!

191
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,150
Wanna hear my story? Well?

192
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,840
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

193
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,150
Y-Yeah...

194
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,130
Okay, pay attention.

195
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,650
You see, that Ging...

196
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,890
was a totally mean guy!

197
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,430
Totally mean!

198
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,400
My name is Dwun!

199
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,170
What do you think is the first letter?

200
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,420
Huh? Isn't it "D"?

201
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,300
Even you, huh?

202
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,150
Of course you'd think so...

203
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,330
After all, you're Ging's son.

204
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,180
Weren't we talking about "D"?

205
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,700
It's "W!" "W!"

206
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,480
W-d-w-u-n-e.

207
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,450
Wdwune!

208
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,060
That was my name!

209
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,570
But even my oldest friends
thought it began with "D."

210
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,870
So when we decided on the
game's name, I was clear...

211
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,520
That my name began with "W."

212
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
What do you think Ging said?

213
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,650
Really?

214
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,240
Then, ditch the "W."

215
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,480
Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...

216
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,530
Dwun.

217
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,960
Can you believe him?

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,220
He changed my name without asking.

219
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,360
Just so the title of the game would work!

220
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,860
What's really amazing

221
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,970
is that Ging had legally changed
the name a minute later.

222
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,230
He only needed a phone and a computer.

223
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,230
What's worse is that he even removed
the "E" because he got confused!

224
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,890
But your luck has been better as a result.

225
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,900
I guess! Ever since...

226
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,040
Once I've chosen the three cards,
I'm supposed to go to the port.

227
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,030
Did they tell you about your father?

228
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,420
Yeah, but they don't know
where he is right now.

229
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,760
Oh...

230
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,470
So I guess the game didn't have any clues.

231
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,170
Well, that's what the starting message said.

232
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,190
Yeah, that's true.

233
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,600
So, what will you do for the three cards?

234
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,050
How about we each pick one?

235
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,930
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

236
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,540
Then I want Blue Planet!

237
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,410
This is still the best one!

238
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,690
I can't wait to see the real thing...

239
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,390
Which one do you want, Killua?

240
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,330
I'm still thinking.

241
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,780
Have you decided, Gon?

242
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,700
Yeah, I think so.

243
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,220
Really? Which one?

244
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,950
Let's see...

245
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,630
This one.

246
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,640
Which one?

247
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,480
Wait, why this one?

248
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,050
I get it.

249
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,690
That makes sense.

250
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,210
You're only allowed to take
restricted slot cards...

251
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,590
Yep, that sounds fun!

252
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,790
When did you have the idea?

253
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,090
The moment I saw this card.

254
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,910
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

255
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,340
But this one won't be enough.

256
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,360
Right, we also need this one.

257
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,100
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]

258
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,100
Eh?

259
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,250
Do you think this will work?

260
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,530
Yeah.

261
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,170
And this is the only way to do it!

262
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,700
Wait, what is this?

263
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,980
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,490
You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,490
Let me in on this!

266
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,460
Congratulations on clearing the game.

267
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,470
Please choose three restricted
slot cards from your binder.

268
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,720
You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,

269
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,700
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.

270
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,330
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

271
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,410
#81, Blue Planet,

272
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,050
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

273
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,480
and #84, Paladin's Necklace.

274
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,770
Are you sure these are the three cards you want?

275
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,600
Yep.

276
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,740
Then I will now return your ring.

277
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
Good work.

278
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,180
Thank you...

279
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,620
Uh, Elena-san!

280
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,760
You remembered my name?

281
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,870
Thank you.

282
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,180
Goodbye.

283
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,700
Welcome back!

284
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,620
Yeah.

285
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,020
We're back in the real world now?

286
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,010
I can't tell.

287
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,900
Well, the game was part of the real world.

288
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,450
Hey, hurry up!

289
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,150
Bring out your binder...

290
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,210
Book.

291
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,680
Gain!

292
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,840
This is it!

293
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
This is what I wanted!

294
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,540
The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!

295
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm so happy!

296
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,790
What should I name it?

297
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,830
Pla-chan?

298
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,220
Maybe Blue-chan?

299
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,270
Planet-chan?

300
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,750
Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!

301
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,920
So, are you sure about the two you picked?

302
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,770
Yeah, these are the best ones, right?

303
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,440
Yep.

304
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,820
Then let's give it a go!

305
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,950
Yeah!

306
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,180
Gain!

307
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,450
Give it to me, Killua.

308
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,690
Yes! It worked!

309
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,720
Okay!

310
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,350
I see.

311
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,030
You used Transform to make
Accompany a restricted slot card,

312
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,960
then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.

313
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,600
That's clever thinking...

314
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,870
But I'm surprised you'd do
all that for an Accompany,

315
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,990
rather than choose a restricted slot card.

316
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,750
Yeah...

317
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,240
Well, if I hadn't been the first
one of us to enter the game,

318
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,340
I probably wouldn't have noticed.

319
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,120
Remember when we played
rock-paper-scissors here?

320
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,780
Rock-paper-scissors?

321
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah.

322
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
I was the first to enter the game.

323
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,570
And while I was waiting for Killua,
no one else was around.

324
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,140
Which means the first person I met in the game

325
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,010
should have been the second
one to go in, Goreinu-san.

326
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,650
But when I checked my binder,

327
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,310
there was someone I met before him.

328
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,420
Nigg
Goreinu

329
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,530
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,910
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!

331
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,420
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.

332
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,040
He was probably trying to tell me this:

333
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,280
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,

334
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,080
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...

335
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,920
Your dedication is really something.

336
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,440
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?

337
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,370
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!

338
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,900
My best friend in the world!

339
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,300
Stupid! Cut that out!

340
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,650
It's embarrassing...

341
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,330
Really...

342
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,790
Stop it...

343
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,720
I can't take this!

344
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,210
It must be age.

345
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,560
It doesn't take much to make me cry...

346
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,350
Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?

347
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,330
No, I'll pass.

348
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,540
I'm not interested in men who already have kids.

349
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,770
Okay.

350
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,970
If I stay with you any longer,
I really will get too attached.

351
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,950
Well, take care, Bisky.

352
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,100
Yeah.

353
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,880
You, too.

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Thank you very much!

355
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,260
Osu!

356
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,770
Accompany on!

357
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,530
Nigg!

358
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,680
Bye-bye.

359
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,110
Gon has cleared the game his father created,

360
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,160
becoming much stronger.

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,720
Is the one waiting before him really Ging?

362
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:17,270
G.I. Tutorial

363
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,000
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

364
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,350
Today, we beat Greed Island.

365
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,360
We've introduced a whole bunch of cards.

366
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,500
I did all the introducing!

367
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,610
You just fooled aro—

368
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,190
Game over.

369
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,170
Killua Zoldyck                                        Gon Freecs

371

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,180
