00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,830
As Gon was dedicating all of his
power to finishing off Neferpitou,

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,950
Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,050
inside the west tower, where Komugi had been.

5
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,520
Once we're through here...

6
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,590
The west tower's second floor.

7
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,030
Once we've passed this area,

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
the King will never remember her!

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,040
As long as I don't give him
an opportunity to see her...

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,010
Flash x And x Start

11
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,540
Something is missing...

12
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,680
But what is it?

13
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,400
I don't know.

14
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,990
I know...

15
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,840
I won't say anything.

16
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,000
I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.

17
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,990
Ideally, he should stay as he is now.

18
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,850
I have

19
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,310
a feeling that something is
missing from this place.

20
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,860
Though it may just be a side
effect of my memory loss.

21
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
Exactly...

22
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,750
Your memory can be verified
through what you see.

23
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,620
Which means you can recover all
of the memories you need.

24
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,630
I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.

25
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,780
Yes.

26
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,150
However, that can be moved up.

27
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,240
By 9:00,

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,020
the remaining humans will be gathered
in the plain before the palace.

29
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,310
What is it?

30
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,790
I have not used my scales

31
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,890
on the humans still on their way in.

32
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,060
We don't want them to cause a commotion,

33
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,110
so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them.

34
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,260
What will you do, Youpi?

35
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,700
Right...

36
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,910
I'll look for Pitou.

37
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,120
Right now, I don't have the
strength to protect you.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,860
Pitou...

39
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,560
Did you just remember something?

40
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh, yeah... We haven't told
the King about Pitou yet.

41
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,820
Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?

42
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,280
Yes,

43
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,190
one of my three Royal Guards.

44
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,790
I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly,

45
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,350
it seems a mystery that I
didn't remember it until now.

46
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,520
So words can also trigger his memory,

47
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,980
not just images...

48
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,190
We cannot let him hear her name.

49
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,510
We must be very careful...

50
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,780
The key will be convincing Pitou.

51
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,580
I know...

52
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,330
Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?

53
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,230
There it is again...

54
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm counting on you.

55
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,240
Yes...

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,070
I...

57
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,300
asked Pitou

58
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,250
to do something for me.

59
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,600
Youpi.

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
Yes...

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,140
Bring Pitou to me at once.

62
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,980
Yes.

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,700
What will you do, Meruem-sama?

64
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,570
Enemies are still around.

65
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,610
Indeed...

66
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,900
As I search for Pitou myself,

67
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,900
I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.

68
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,590
This is bad!

69
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,450
Your Majesty, that would be...

70
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,820
It is merely for entertainment.

71
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,860
And I am sure these enemies
have useful information.

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,920
However, we won't be at your side,

73
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,020
and we don't know what enemies remain—

74
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,950
I want an honest answer,

75
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,930
Pouf.

76
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,510
Do you believe there is a chance

77
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,020
that these intruders could get the better of me?!

78
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,950
No...

79
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,720
Absolutely not.

80
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,400
Th-This exceeds my expectations...

81
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,110
The King...

82
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,230
Meruem-sama...

83
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,200
is the ultimate being.

84
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,790
That much is certain!

85
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,250
The overwhelming aura

86
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,090
left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed,

87
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,020
in total despair.

88
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:21,020
Th-This isn't something we can deal with...

89
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,940
To handle this, you'd need an entire
nation's military might.

90
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,610
Meleoron, we're making a run for it!

91
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,200
Seriously?

92
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,570
You bet!

93
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,260
We'll head back to Peijing under
the cover of this crowd!

94
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,950
What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?

95
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,560
There's nothing we can do!

96
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,380
If they can see that, they'll understand.

97
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,860
They'll run away, too.

98
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,770
That's the only option.

99
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,630
That isn't...

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,130
something we can handle.

101
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,010
But if you and I team up...

102
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,010
We could land one attack, sure.

103
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,140
And we could probably attach APR.

104
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,870
But...

105
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,530
APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!

106
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,020
If we're within fifty meters of him...

107
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,040
Do you think we'd last long
enough for him to go bust?

108
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,040
You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!

109
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,390
The situation's changed...

110
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,270
The enemy knows about our powers!

111
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,550
They can prepare for us.

112
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,030
I was an idiot.

113
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,950
We needed to notify the Association
right away of the chairman's defeat,

114
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,270
so they could immediately initiate
the next plan of action.

115
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,000
Hurry!

116
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,320
Revenge and duty...

117
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,270
The difference in motivations
between Meleoron and Knuckle

118
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,790
placed growing distance between
them as they walked.

119
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,080
At that moment...

120
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,040
Meruem's En lit up the palace and the
surrounding area in a literal flash.

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,860
Sensing there were two enemies nearby,
he began with Knuckle.

122
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,390
Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought

123
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,550
that he should activate his power
when he was knocked out.

124
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
Where's the King?

125
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,510
It disappeared!

126
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,770
I shall be interrogating them.

127
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,520
Once I am done, do as you like.

128
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,250
There were two other Nen users whose aura

129
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,780
reacted to my En.

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,760
One of them must be carrying
the unconscious Komugi.

131
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,420
What do I do? What do I do?

132
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,010
I must stop the King...

133
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,920
Your Majesty!

134
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,690
If your purpose is entertainment,
shouldn't you take your time?

135
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,000
It appears

136
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,460
that you have a proposal.

137
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,690
Yes... Would you be willing

138
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,450
to engage in a contest with us?

139
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,520
A contest?

140
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,520
Again...

141
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,700
A contest...

142
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,120
A contest...

143
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,080
A contest...

144
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,690
A contest...

145
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,660
What contest?

146
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,070
Youpi and I will search for Pitou,

147
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,620
while you search for the
two remaining Nen users.

148
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,290
A contest to see who locates their target first?

149
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:39,980
Yes.

150
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,420
But don't you need to go and spread scales?

151
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,740
Correct.

152
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,460
So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,

153
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,020
I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.

154
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,940
It is very clear

155
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,630
that the difference in power between you
and the intruders is insurmountable.

156
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,500
Finding and capturing them should
only take you a few seconds.

157
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,750
That cannot be called entertainment.

158
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,500
Meanwhile, we must find Pitou,

159
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,190
who has engaged an enemy that
seems capable of teleportation.

160
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,300
And Pitou's current location is unknown.

161
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,880
To make up for the difference,

162
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,110
we request additional time,
as well as one further handicap.

163
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,910
One further handicap?

164
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,540
What is it?

165
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,370
You are only allowed to use En once more.

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,740
How does that sound?

167
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,380
Amusing.

168
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,090
I accept this contest.

169
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,390
Thank you very much.

170
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,760
Perfect...

171
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,460
I can use the extra time to kill that woman!

172
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,400
As long as we are playing,
I have a proposal, as well.

173
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,660
If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish.

174
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,900
Yes, sir.

175
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,490
We are very honored.

176
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,910
And what if you win, Meruem-sama?

177
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,320
If I win,

178
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,420
you will tell me what you are hiding from me.

179
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,810
Your Majesty...

180
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,600
Silence.

181
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,960
I already told you...

182
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,320
You and I are united as one.

183
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:49,450
Did you think that I could not sense
the guilt that you now feel?

184
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,530
However, I sense that your feelings
of loyalty are stronger.

185
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,010
Otherwise, I would have sent
your heads flying long ago.

186
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,330
I am certain you have your reasons.

187
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,850
I shall not ask them...

188
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,260
Assuming that you beat me.

189
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,520
You will obtain what you desire,
and protect your secret.

190
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,490
You could not wish for better terms...

191
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,810
Assuming that you beat me.

192
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,380
Meruem-sama...

193
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,380
I shall immediately begin to spread
scales, and not waste a moment.

194
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,510
If we lose, we will tell you everything.

195
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,050
I swear it on my life.

196
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,270
You do not appear to be treating
this as mere entertainment.

197
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,210
Once Pouf finishes spreading his
scales and returns, I shall begin.

198
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,530
Is that acceptable?

199
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Yes.

200
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,160
Victory goes to whomever returns to
this room with their target first.

201
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,600
If Pitou should return,

202
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,450
you are to explain the objective of this contest

203
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,170
and order Pitou to hide.

204
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,170
As you wish.

205
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,830
I shall tell you that

206
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,790
the two Nen users my En registered

207
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,930
were an octopus and a human
carrying some sort of burden.

208
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,900
I must win.

209
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,880
No, victory is already assured!

210
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,820
The question is what to do
about Pitou and the woman.

211
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,440
Then...

212
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,080
Start!

213
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,560
Where do you think Pitou went?

214
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,590
It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!

215
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,270
Turn around and wait by the west
tower for Pitou's return.

216
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,090
Do not allow Pitou near the King!

217
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,450
You can't use clones while you
spread your scales, right?

218
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,480
Then you aren't buying us any time.

219
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
Trust me!

220
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,790
I'm begging you!

221
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,990
Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...

222
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,470
Those two are dead.

223
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,000
No,

224
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,790
they're still alive.

225
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,060
They were only knocked unconscious...

226
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,000
Where's Gon?

227
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,690
Killua's carrying him...

228
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,230
His hair is long?

229
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,300
Is it someone else?

230
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,590
No, those are the only two
figures in my crystal ball.

231
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,690
That is Gon!

232
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,940
Something must have happened
when I wasn't watching.

233
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,490
Where's Pitou?

234
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,610
In any case, don't come back here... Please!

235
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,030
Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...

236
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,970
Are they poisonous?

237
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,170
It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.

238
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,800
In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side.

239
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
I must get as far from my
previous location as I can...

240
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,800
After that En wave, I immediately used Wink Blue,

241
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,260
and the King appeared next to Pouf,
carrying Knuckle and Meleoron.

242
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,210
Only a few seconds had passed!

243
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,890
Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me.

244
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,960
The King could be standing behind
me at any moment...

245
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,240
I must hurry and get farther away...

246
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,580
Before the King uses En again!

247
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,180
I must go in there!

248
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,700
If I'm crossing the plain when he uses En, I won't be able to escape!

249
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,060
If I'm deep underground,
perhaps his En won't reach.

250
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,590
But I'm also trapping myself.

251
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,930
Should I escape outside the palace,

252
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,250
and hope that the King doesn't
make a move for a while?

253
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,180
There's no reason to expect him not to!

254
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,690
What should I do?

255
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,860
What is the right decision?

256
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,480
Ikalgo!

257
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
I thought you might come here...

258
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,370
Let's go in! Hurry!

259
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,710
Yes, but...

260
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,430
Hurry!

261
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,220
Isn't that why you came here?

262
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,830
If he uses En again, we're finished!

263
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,130
Where's Killua?

264
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,320
He went after Gon.

265
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,750
They're together now.

266
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,190
I don't know what happened to Pitou.

267
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,470
I see...

268
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,720
So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.

269
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,270
The King is on a whole other level.

270
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,770
Why do you think their lives were spared?

271
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,930
Um, well...

272
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,430
It's possible that I just want
to think that they're alive...

273
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,540
They're alive.

274
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,670
Probably so they can be exchanged.

275
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,680
You mean the way Killua discussed
exchanging hostages?

276
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,810
I'll set a trap...

277
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,590
I'm not going out without a fight.

278
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,710
First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!

279
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,980
A contest...

280
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,210
A contest...

281
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,760
Next time: Deadline x To x Live.

282
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,130
Killua...

283
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,580
Don't you dare speak his name!

284
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,390
You would never understand!

285
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,350
Killua!
