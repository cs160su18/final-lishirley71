Staff of Judgment
If player names a target,
while raising staff toward the sky,
disaster will befall either player or target,
depending on which has done more evil.

00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,430
Elder's Growth Pills
Each pill taken helps player grow 1 centimeter.
Each bottle contains 100 pills.
Not recommended for those under 20.

Fledgling CEO
If you warm this fledgling egg
in your hands 3 hours a day,
it will hatch in 1 to 10 years.
The feelings you put into warming
it will speed the process.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,250
Yes! Halfway there!

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,570
That makes fifty types!

7
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,040
15 x 15

8
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,590
Genthru and his men have a plan in mind,

9
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,620
as they prepare to trade
with Team Tsezgerra.

10
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,080
Let's get this over with, then.

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,990
Okay, trade complete.

12
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,070
No, hold on.

13
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,820
I cannot accept this.

14
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,610
This is an unfair trade.

15
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,620
What? Don't complain once it's done!

16
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,310
We gave you three cards!

17
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,720
What more do you want?

18
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,790
Wait a second...
That isn't what I meant.

19
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,870
I'm saying that it's unfair to you.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,480
It's too skewed in our favor.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,030
I dislike the idea of
benefiting from charity.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
And it will continue to bother me,

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
even if we clear the game first.

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,710
So I have a proposition.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,320
Right or left.

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
I'll give you one of these cards.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,170
One is worthless,

28
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,070
but the other is Breath of Archangel.

29
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,190
Good Luck

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,450
Okay!

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,310
Levy on!

32
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,170
Crap!

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,960
Return on.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,030
To Masadora!

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,750
Let's go after them!

36
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,700
Wait!

37
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,260
First, check your cards!

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,880
I lost one of the #80 cards
we were monopolizing.

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,140
As well as a #65.

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,230
Hey, what did you lose?

41
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,940
I lost #42 and #53.

42
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,500
I lost #29 and #24.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
They got me good!

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,660
I lost two of the #85
cards we were hoarding.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,900
All the ones they took were
restricted slot cards...

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,770
And they took both card types
that we were monopolizing.

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,490
Damn!

48
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,540
They must have used Risky Dice.

49
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,750
We're not with them!

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,970
They used items to change our faces!

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,650
Anyway, we have to pursue them!

52
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,730
No!

53
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,140
Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?

54
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,550
U-Uh, we don't know.

55
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,900
But he went like this with his hand and
blew the head off the guy I was with.

56
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,700
A power clearly meant for murder.

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,070
So he's a fighter.

58
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,480
It would be unwise to
fight them head-on.

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,330
But they took at least five
different card types from us!

60
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,890
They could have completed
their collection!

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,620
List on!

62
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,590
#2!

63
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore.
Currently, 0 cards in play.

64
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,560
We're still okay.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,300
They haven't found #2,
Patch of Shore, yet.

66
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,470
Our immediate priority

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,850
is to find #2 before they do!

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,110
We still have our voucher
for Breath of Archangel,

69
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,380
so we can still beat them.

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,730
Right, let's find it first, then.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,650
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

72
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,670
Accompany on!

73
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,320
To Soufrabi!

74
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,260
We did it... A big success.

75
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,820
The Risky Dice and Levy
combination paid off.

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,560
That puts us at ninety-three types.

77
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,010
No, we used one up to
change those faces,

78
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,170
so it's ninety-two.

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,310
The important thing is that we took
the cards they were monopolizing.

80
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,300
And for two of the others, we're just
waiting for someone to use Gain on them.

81
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,680
The biggest obstacle is #2.

82
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,310
But we know that it's in Soufrabi.

83
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,150
All right, we'll go after #72,

84
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,870
#21, and #9 in that order.

85
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,320
Then we'll make for
Soufrabi, to find #2.

86
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,020
For #75, we simply need to find
someone with it, then take it.

87
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,500
I think it's time we began thinking...

88
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,280
About the three restricted
slot cards we want to keep,

89
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,350
and how we want to spend the 50 billion.

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,390
Hey, Killua...

91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,440
Something's been bugging me.

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,340
Huh?

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,350
Aren't there hundreds of players?

94
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,060
Isn't it weird that we've been able

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,470
to turn all our items into cards?

96
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,470
What do you mean?

97
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,480
Even B-rank restricted slot types
have a thirty-card limit.

98
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,310
The players here before us should
have already collected them.

99
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,660
That's true.

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,610
But you can also see it this way.

101
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,120
Fewer than thirty teams in this game
are capable of making real progress.

102
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,870
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,980
Most players aren't worried
about getting restricted slot cards.

104
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,510
They're just struggling to find
a way out of the game.

105
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,260
It would suck if you got to Masadora,
and there weren't any Leave cards.

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,140
Yeah, that's why...

107
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,640
I get it...

108
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,750
Huh?

109
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,600
If you guys got to Masadora,
but there weren't any Leave cards,

110
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,650
what would you do?

111
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,380
Well...

112
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,150
I'd save money until a Leave showed up.

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340
Yeah.

114
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,010
Okay, then what if

115
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,880
you acquired a super rare
spell card while waiting?

116
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,530
Sell it and buy more spell
cards until a Leave came in.

117
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,470
Really?!

118
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,210
I would save it...

119
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,450
Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you
bought ended up being worthless?

120
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,040
If you saved it, you might be
able to trade for a Leave—

121
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,330
See?

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,810
Need a Leave?

123
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,270
Want to go back to the real world?

124
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,330
We've gotten four restricted
slot cards for three Leaves.

125
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,710
Okay, that makes a total
of fifty-four types.

126
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,720
Score!

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,900
So the cards that wouldn't fit in
our binders reverted to items.

128
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,070
We're running out of free pockets.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,100
Then we should organize them now.

130
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,020
We three have a total
of 135 free pockets.

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,840
We should each leave
around 5 pockets free.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,480
You keep the spell cards, Killua.

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,610
Bisky should also have
a few defensive ones.

134
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,860
Wait! I have to use spell cards?

135
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,570
No way! I don't know how they work.

136
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,490
The hell? Then learn how they work!

137
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,160
Okay...

138
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,010
Book.

139
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,680
We've been deliberately
avoiding other players,

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,660
but we'll have to take risks
to obtain the rarer cards.

141
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,630
Yeah.

142
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,140
Well, let's get what we can ourselves,

143
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,390
then negotiate aggressively
with any players we come across.

144
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,040
Sound good?

145
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,190
Yeah.

146
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,020
Yep!

147
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,000
See ya.

148
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,400
Hold on.

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,610
This is worthless.

150
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,280
It's a transformed Fake.

151
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,460
Sorry about that.
I gave you the wrong one.

152
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,750
Here's the real one.

153
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,290
Man, you can't lower your guard
around any of these guys.

154
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,610
No kidding...

155
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,410
Still, that necklace is quite useful.

156
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,180
Hey, this necklace can
remove curses, right?

157
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,390
Only from spell cards.

158
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,670
Oh, so it won't work.

159
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,180
Did you have an idea?

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,710
I was wondering if a curse
was behind the disease

161
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,110
that all those villagers
were suffering from.

162
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,800
Villagers?

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,320
Oh, those people...

164
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,240
The ones who took all your money.

165
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,560
But it won't work since
they aren't cards.

166
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,240
No.

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,110
It's worth a shot.

168
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,250
Will you trust us with your lives?

169
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,930
You freely gave us everything you had.

170
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,760
We will trust you!

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,860
Sick Villagers
Villagers struck by a
contagion passing
around the island.

172
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,940
Healthy Villagers
Healthy villagers who
recovered from the contagion
going around the island.

173
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,560
It worked!

174
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,870
Thank you very much!

175
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,950
This treasure has been
passed down for generations.

176
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,050
Please accept this
token of our gratitude.

177
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,710
Awesome!

178
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,710
Lucky Alexandrite
Owner will enjoy
once-in-a-lifetime experiences,
for better or for worse.

179
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,330
Lucky Alexandrite! Score!

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,600
Another player has used
Contact to reach you.

181
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,220
Yo, this is Kazsule.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,670
I'd like to talk to you.

183
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,100
Could we meet in person?

184
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,230
About what?

185
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,980
Some people are close
to clearing the game.

186
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,200
Huh?

187
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,350
It's a team of three,
led by someone named Genthru.

188
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,320
Genthru!

189
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,900
Thanks for coming, everyone.

190
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,160
Much appreciated.

191
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,910
Team Kazsule

192
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,910
As I mentioned via Contact,

193
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,910
Team Asta

194
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,760
Team Genthru is close
to completing the game.

195
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,170
Team Hanse

196
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,130
I just checked the ranking,

197
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,590
Goreinu

198
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,980
and they're currently
at ninety-six types.

199
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,670
Team Yabibi

200
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,250
We must figure out a way to stop them.

201
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,210
Can I ask something?

202
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,930
What is it?

203
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,440
How do you check the ranking?

204
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,100
Well...

205
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,680
You don't know how to do that?

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
If we answer all their questions,
we'll be here till dawn!

207
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,310
Just cut to the chase.

208
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,250
Now, don't be so mean...

209
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,570
We're all here to exchange information.

210
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,800
They could have information
you don't, Asta.

211
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,320
That's impossible.

212
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,700
Those kids are amateurs who don't even
know how to use the Trade Shop.

213
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,910
In the Trade Shop,

214
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,830
there's a ranking that lists
players and their total

215
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,330
restricted slot cards.

216
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,840
If you pay a fee, you can even learn
the numbers of their cards.

217
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,940
But getting a player's name from
the ranking still won't let you

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,750
use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,240
Not until you actually meet them.

220
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,740
Don't you feel smarter now, boys?

221
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,690
In other words, if we know
the members of a team,

222
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,900
we can determine how
many cards they have.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,680
And Team Genthru is only missing #0,

224
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,370
#2, #9, and #75.

225
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,030
#75...

226
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,800
There's a solid theory that #0 appears

227
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,910
in an event after the other
ninety-nine are collected,

228
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,250
so they only need three.

229
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,830
We propose to find one of those
three types before they do

230
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,760
and monopolize it, to prevent
them from clearing the game.

231
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,490
There's gotta be something else.

232
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,890
We could deluge them with spell cards.

233
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,150
They already have a Paladin's Necklace.

234
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,650
So Levy is the only
spell that will work.

235
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,650
Levy
Take 1 card at random from every
player within 20 meters of caster.
[SR][SP]

236
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,650
And they can block Levy if
certain conditions are met.

237
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,150
It's safe to assume

238
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,410
that Genthru is willing to reveal
that they have ninety-six types

239
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,910
Prison
All slotted cards on target page are
immune to theft or destruction via spell card
until removed.
(Only targets
pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

240
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,910
because their pages are
protected by Prison.

241
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,310
That's possible...

242
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,280
Genthru was collecting
a bunch of spell cards

243
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,550
with the others who tried to recruit us.

244
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,240
It's a reasonable assumption.

245
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,520
We could always take
their cards by force.

246
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,140
Would you be willing to lead the attack?

247
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,730
We don't know what kind
of abilities they have.

248
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,960
Finding a card type to monopolize
is the most practical option.

249
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,430
I assume no one has objections.

250
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,290
Then let's get to business.

251
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,150
We'll need everyone here to cooperate.

252
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,230
I'm fine with the proposed plan.

253
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,320
But I have a problem with these members.

254
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,750
Hold on, Asta.

255
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,510
I followed your condition...

256
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,890
Have over fifty types of cards.

257
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,950
These six teams met that condition.

258
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,990
I also said that they had to be
people who could contribute.

259
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,220
I don't see how these kids
can contribute anything.

260
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,470
You're the one being uncooperative.

261
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,710
You've got a smart mouth.

262
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,520
Then show me some proof
that you can be useful.

263
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,620
We know Team Genthru's abilities.

264
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,480
We have one of the three
cards they're missing.

265
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,180
Still dissatisfied?

266
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,810
No, that's good enough.

267
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,030
So tell us what their abilities are.

268
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,000
What about you?

269
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,620
Show us some proof you
can be useful to us.

270
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,610
We have seventy-one types
of restricted slot cards...

271
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,100
Significantly more than you.

272
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,130
I'll give you an A-rank card in
return for the information.

273
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,380
You shouldn't have a problem with that.

274
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,870
I have a problem.

275
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,390
We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.

276
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,880
So give us two S-rank cards or
equally valuable information.

277
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,450
Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing.

278
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,640
Don't get too cocky, brat!

279
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,710
Did you hear that, everyone?

280
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,410
These kids won't be any help.

281
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,260
They want two S-rank
cards from each team.

282
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,030
That's ten cards they'd take.

283
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,550
Don't be a fool.

284
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,060
I'm only taking cards from your team.

285
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,800
Huh?

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,700
I'm fine with giving information
to the other four.

287
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,660
I'll let them decide
what to offer in return.

288
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,650
But I won't tell you anything
until you meet my condition.

289
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,780
You are a stupid brat...

290
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,670
Throwing a tantrum because
I didn't baby you, huh?

291
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,600
Stop this, both of you...

292
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,550
We don't have time to
fight amongst ourselves!

293
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,300
I haven't agreed to
team up with them yet!

294
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,130
It's fine, Asta...

295
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,470
Give them two cards.

296
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,310
We need to move on.

297
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,490
What?!

298
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,620
I have no problem with
giving them cards!

299
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,310
But that kid's trying to pick a fight!

300
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,210
You're the one picking a fight!

301
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,390
Hey, let's leave.

302
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,590
I don't want to team
up with these people!

303
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,050
Come, now...
Though I admit I'm a bit peeved.

304
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,830
But given the circumstances...

305
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,260
Genthru has these two abilities,
Countdown and Little Flower.

306
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,840
So it's best to keep
your distance from him.

307
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,340
Seriously? He got me...

308
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,500
Same here.

309
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,240
He touched me when we
were making a deal.

310
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,590
Me, too...

311
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,760
Sounds like a bunch of
them might be victims.

312
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,720
A chance!

313
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,410
Isn't there any way to
disable his technique?

314
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,900
Yep, there is...

315
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,270
You have to touch Genthru and say,
"I caught the Bomber."

316
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,780
Stupid! Why did you tell them?

317
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,120
We could've gotten more
cards out of them!

318
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,490
That would have started another fight.

319
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,120
The bombs can't be armed until Genthru
explains how his ability works,

320
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,990
so if you keep away from him,

321
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,660
you should be safe.

322
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Did you know there are
two ways to cast spells?

323
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,470
Yep, I did.

324
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,130
A spell card is used up the
moment you say its name aloud.

325
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,760
But it's possible to
keep reusing a spell.

326
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,570
Huh?

327
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,230
For example, you know how a list

328
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,140
of players you've met appears if
you put Steal in your binder?

329
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,500
If you remove the card without
pressing the select button,

330
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,770
the spell card isn't used up,
so you can keep reusing it.

331
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,910
I never tried that.

332
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,530
Yeah.

333
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,660
You can buy all B-rank
restricted slot cards at stores.

334
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480
You simply need to buy from the
same Trade Shop over fifty times.

335
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,590
If you become a frequent customer,
they'll start making you offers.

336
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,900
Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?

337
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,040
Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?

338
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,550
Is that enough information

339
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,550
to satisfy you?

340
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,400
I'll give you another
card if you're not happy.

341
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,500
Nope, that's enough, thanks!

342
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,560
I'm up next, then.

343
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,490
I'm Goreinu.

344
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,560
Nice to meet you.

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,810
Thanks, everyone!

346
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,530
That was very educational.

347
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,030
The question now is which card
we should try to monopolize.

348
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,650
It's probably impossible to
monopolize the #75 we have.

349
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,210
Each team can only obtain one,
and the limit is twenty,

350
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,200
which is too high.

351
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,320
You obtained #75?

352
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
That's impressive.

353
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,220
List on!

354
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,700
#75.

355
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,470
Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
Currently, 6 cards are in play.

356
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,470
So five other teams each have one.

357
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,790
Monopolizing this one
will be impossible.

358
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,230
What about the other two?

359
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,140
List on!

360
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,910
#9!

361
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,260
List on.

362
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,240
#2.

363
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,950
No good.

364
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,180
There are three teams with #9.

365
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,320
No one has #2, Patch of Shore...

366
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,740
We can make it work!

367
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,010
Guide Post On.

368
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,780
#2.

369
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,250
I know where to find it...

370
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,750
Soufrabi.

371
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,150
I've been there before!

372
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,800
I have an Accompany card here.

373
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,500
Okay, let's go.

374
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,620
Accompany on!

375
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,590
To Soufrabi!

376
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,260
This is Soufrabi?

377
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,400
It's a pretty big city...

378
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,270
Soufrabi

379
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,740
Let's head in and snoop around.

380
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,230
Search every room, one by one.

381
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,400
Some characters may not
give you information

382
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,810
until you visit multiple
times, so pay attention.

383
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,970
Okay!

384
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,900
Hey!

385
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,550
I found someone with information.

386
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,660
Fast!

387
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,160
The pirates rule this city...

388
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,690
There's a legend about
an underwater cavern

389
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,670
called the Sea God's Grotto
located somewhere in this area.

390
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,680
Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.

391
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,520
A few years ago, having heard of the
legendary cavern and its treasure,

392
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,690
fifteen pirates arrived in this city.

393
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,690
Razor and the fourteen devils...

394
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,710
The city fishermen were
all tortured and killed.

395
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,490
The pirates murdered anyone who
knew about Patch of Shore.

396
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,990
If you get rid of the pirates,
I'll tell you what I know.

397
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,980
When we visited a few months earlier,
we couldn't find a single clue.

398
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,200
This must be information only
available at certain times.

399
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
Maybe an event that only
occurs at this time frame?

400
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,520
Razor and the fourteen devils...

401
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,830
It's possible that the event

402
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,210
was triggered by the
number of players here.

403
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,020
Huh?

404
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,920
There are fifteen pirates.

405
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,220
And it just so happens that
there are fifteen of us.

406
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,280
So the event won't start until you
have a party of fifteen or more?

407
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,760
But how would a game
character know that?

408
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,790
Oh, Accompany!

409
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,180
Yes, a group of fifteen or more must
reach Soufrabi with Accompany.

410
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,420
That's probably the
trigger for this event.

411
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Brutal...

412
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,400
Huh?

413
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,530
Oh, nothing.

414
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,580
Let's go to the pirate's base!

415
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,190
Gon and his friends stand before
some unpleasant looking pirates.

416
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,510
Will the fifteen allies be able
to obtain Patch of Shore?

417
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,300
G.I. Tutorial

418
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

419
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,100
Today, we introduce the card
Tax Collector's Gauntlet.

420
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:18,830
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)

421
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,970
If you turn this card into
an item and equip it,

422
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,880
you can steal random cards from others.

423
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,580
And you can keep reusing it!

424
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,460
Clunk.

425
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,970
Continue!

426
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,960
Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.

427
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,450
Go!

428
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,050
I can't say that!
