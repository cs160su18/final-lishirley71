00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,540
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,480
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,530
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,390
He was probably trying to tell me this:

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,670
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,650
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,510
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,630
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,970
My best friend in the world!

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,270
Accompany on!

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,020
Nigg!

13
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Reunion x And x Understanding

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,660
Is that

15
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,810
Gon's...

16
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,570
G-Ging...

17
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,770
I got a slot machine in my mouth!

18
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,510
It goes from 1 to 9.

19
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,940
Each number summons a different weapon.

20
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,930
This is my

21
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,540
Crazy Slots!

22
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,670
Crazy Slots:
Psychotic Clown

23
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,840
Give me something good...

24
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,680
4!

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,440
Damn, bad roll.

26
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,310
Shut up!

27
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,320
You should be grateful, you idiot!

28
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,000
An ant?

29
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,530
Are you hurt?

30
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,500
Is that Ging?

31
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,660
That isn't Ging...

32
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,880
Hey...

33
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
What was that about?

34
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,270
First you push us down, then you fire at us!

35
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,940
Enough fooling around!

36
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,570
Fooling around?

37
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,010
I was being dead serious.

38
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,440
If I hadn't opened fire,
you would have been attacked.

39
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,660
By what?!

40
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,970
The ant you shot?

41
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,360
Ow!

42
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,390
What is this?

43
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,890
Idiot!

44
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,020
That's no ordinary ant.

45
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,440
It's a Chimera Ant.

46
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,840
A Chimera Ant?

47
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,680
An aggressive, carnivorous insect,
currently under class-1 quarantine.

48
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,720
From time to time, they even attack humans.

49
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,110
You were standing right in front of their nest.

50
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,420
Had I not fired,

51
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,250
a Chimera Ant army would
have consumed you by now.

52
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,910
I feel like this has happened before...

53
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,840
Don't worry, it's not serious.

54
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,070
Apply this.

55
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,240
It's an antibiotic.

56
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,350
What? That's it?

57
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,610
Let's go nuts, man!

58
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,910
Shut up... Go away.

59
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,420
You should leave, as well.

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,350
Damn...

61
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,080
Because of this interruption,
I'll need to start over.

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,510
But the nest was destroyed.

63
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,390
Man, forced to take another life...

64
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,520
Ah!

65
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,260
Man, forced to take another life...

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,830
Are you...

67
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,580
Are you the one

68
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,040
who saved me back then?

69
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,860
Back then?

70
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,690
On Whale Island, after I stumbled into
the territory of a foxbear with its cub.

71
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,090
Whale Island?

72
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,770
That time, too,

73
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,810
you had to kill, in order to protect me.

74
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,450
Oh, yes. I remember now.

75
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,660
I never expected to run into you again here.

76
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,330
You've grown, Gon.

77
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,460
How do you know my name?

78
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,520
I heard it from your dad,

79
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,670
Ging-san.

80
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,880
Old man, you know Ging?

81
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,860
Old...

82
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,250
Yeah, my name is Kite.

83
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,840
Ging-san was my master.

84
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,080
Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,280
Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?

86
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,770
Call me Kite.

87
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,300
It's awkward being addressed
formally by my master's son.

88
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,670
Okay.

89
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,360
Then, you're one too, Kite?

90
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,990
Yeah, Ging-san was the one who
made me a top-class Hunter.

91
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,230
He was my teacher and benefactor.

92
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,470
If I hadn't met Ging-san,

93
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,050
I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum.

94
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,120
Wait up!

95
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,660
Damned brat!

96
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,790
He swiped the bread that
I'd managed to find...

97
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,040
He isn't escaping today.

98
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,480
My bread!

99
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,450
Bastard,

100
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,950
you won't get away today!

101
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,420
Ow!

102
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,830
What is this?

103
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,990
What are you doing?

104
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,120
Stop it...

105
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,700
You live with these guys?

106
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,650
That sounds fun.

107
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,120
That was how you met Ging?

108
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Yeah...

109
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,670
Ging-san said that good Hunters
are well-liked by animals.

110
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,890
He said I had potential, so I got interested.

111
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,880
And you became his student?

112
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,780
I had to force him to teach me.

113
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,420
He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...

114
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,500
So I was never his student officially.

115
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,190
But I was a stubborn one...

116
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,520
I kept bugging him.

117
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,570
Eventually, I started to develop my Nen,

118
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,570
and he began teaching me to hunt.

119
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,580
As a result, I was able to pass the
Hunter Exam with little difficulty.

120
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,210
But before Ging-san was satisfied,
I had to clear another hurdle.

121
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,960
Can you guess what it was?

122
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,470
I think I might know.

123
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,750
Oh?

124
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,220
No, I definitely know.

125
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,340
This is what Ging would have said...

126
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,980
"Try to catch me."

127
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,560
Exactly. You're right.

128
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
I knew it! I figured that was it!

129
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,740
But as far as I knew, he was
the world's greatest Hunter.

130
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,520
It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.

131
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,960
There were no clues or leads to begin from.

132
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,750
And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.

133
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,880
He'd managed to completely erase
his existence from this world.

134
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,110
Like a super-powered form of Zetsu?

135
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,760
So...

136
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,510
So what happened in the end?

137
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,990
I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,

138
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,020
so I went to his home.

139
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,400
To Whale Island.

140
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,610
That was when I met you, Gon.

141
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,590
But back then, I didn't realize

142
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,850
that you were Ging-san's son.

143
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,190
I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san

144
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,250
and told him about what had
happened on Whale Island.

145
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,780
That was my kid... His name is Gon.

146
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,090
Thanks for hitting him.

147
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,600
It's common sense to avoid

148
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,990
foxbear territory when they're raising young.

149
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,390
Ging-san wasn't surprised

150
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,830
that I went to Whale Island,
or that I met you there.

151
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,300
It was almost as though he'd expected it.

152
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,580
Looking back,

153
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,100
it may be that everything's gone
according to Ging-san's plans.

154
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,150
Are you saying he set all this up?

155
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,550
Well, I can't prove it.

156
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,140
You might be right.

157
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,040
Razor was waiting for me.

158
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,260
And Dwun and List.

159
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,790
Razor? Dwun?

160
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,530
Yeah, in a game called Greed Island...

161
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,420
It's a long story.

162
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,000
In the game, a guy named Razor was
waiting for me, at Ging's request.

163
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,480
My son will come here one day.

164
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,040
When that happens, give him a good beating.

165
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,520
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?

166
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,260
Don't get too cocky.

167
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,690
He is my son.

168
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,160
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

169
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,820
Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends

170
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,130
who helped him create Greed Island.

171
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,470
Oh, Razor was also one of them...

172
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,420
Anyway, those three were waiting for me.

173
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,780
When I learned that, I realized something.

174
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,530
If Ging planned for me to go to Greed
Island and meet his friends,

175
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:47,190
meeting Bisky and the others may have
been another part of his plan.

176
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,800
In that case,

177
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,640
it's possible that Ging also planned
that you'd meet Kite here.

178
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,470
Huh?

179
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,860
Oh, that's right!

180
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,000
You must have been to Greed Island before.

181
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,990
Me?

182
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,010
Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"?

183
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,010
Nigg?

184
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,670
No, I don't recall that name.

185
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,070
Wait...

186
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,830
I do remember Ging-san taking
me inside a game...

187
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,270
I knew it!

188
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,130
Greed Island...

189
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,400
Yes, I believe that was its title.

190
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,460
But I can't remember if I used an alias.

191
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,230
That must be it...

192
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,100
Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.

193
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,250
Damn! He tricked me!

194
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,470
You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?

195
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,730
Are you sure this was the right decision,

196
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
Ging?

197
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,410
Can you make it so that using
Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,

198
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,330
while using Accompany will send him to Kite?

199
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,220
I can...

200
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,950
Why do you want me to do that?

201
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,500
If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on
his own, I'm willing to meet with him.

202
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,660
But I can't meet him if he's so gutless
that he has to bring friends.

203
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,280
Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?

204
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't understand.

205
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,930
Never mind... Just do it!

206
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,470
You'd probably just be
embarrassed if he brought a crowd.

207
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,220
Shut up! Just do it!

208
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,400
He's so weird...

209
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,230
Shy and stubborn.

210
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,440
I feel sorry for Gon-kun.

211
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,490
I understand.

212
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,580
So the game Greed Island was
created to train you boys.

213
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,790
Only Gon, really.

214
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,500
I just tagged along for the ride.

215
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,880
That may have been part of Ging's plan, too.

216
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,850
Even me?

217
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,330
Nah, that's impossible.

218
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,260
However,

219
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,170
it appears that our meeting
here wasn't coincidence.

220
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,600
Yeah, I agree.

221
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,890
There must be a deeper meaning to this.

222
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,320
Meaning?

223
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,720
Razor waited inside the
game to make you stronger,

224
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,520
so one would think Ging must
have some role for Kite to play.

225
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,530
A role...

226
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,730
Your final test was finding Ging, right?

227
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah.

228
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
That sounds like a daunting task.

229
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,990
The best Hunters in this world

230
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,790
are masters of not only hunting,
but concealing themselves as well.

231
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,050
Yet you were able to find him.

232
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,120
Oh...

233
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,420
Yeah, that's true.

234
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,950
Once you cleared your final test,

235
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,680
Ging must have decided you were
worthy of handling this.

236
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,900
Handling this? Handling what?

237
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,670
Handling what? Basically...

238
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,820
Thanks for hitting him.

239
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,220
Say, Gon...

240
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,470
Want me to tell you Ging-san's
current whereabouts?

241
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,090
No, I'll find him on my own.

242
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,340
A good response.

243
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,760
Anyway, tell me about Ging.

244
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,520
Tell me everything you know!

245
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,550
How to help two-headed wolves breed?

246
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,740
Ging is involved in that stuff?

247
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,750
Sure, Ging-san is involved with a
wide range of Hunter activities.

248
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,160
He's never formally applied
because he doesn't want

249
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,060
to expend the energy, but he's as
qualified as a Triple Star Hunter.

250
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,810
Triple Star?

251
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,060
Stars are awarded to Hunters who
perform extraordinary tasks.

252
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,500
Those responsible for

253
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,260
historical discoveries or global
achievements receive three stars.

254
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,710
There are fewer than ten of
these Hunters in the world.

255
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,460
The title "Triple Star Hunter"
is reserved for the very best.

256
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,600
So Ging is as good as the best!

257
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,760
Kite...

258
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,100
A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.

259
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,350
Ging-san is also famous

260
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,800
for discovering the Lurka Ruins
and the Kongo gold vein.

261
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,990
Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!

262
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,430
Kite, student of Ging...

263
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,400
While his meeting

264
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,860
with Gon and Killua signaled the
beginning of a new adventure...

265
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,790
On the Yorbian continent, in the
southernmost of the Balsa Islands,

266
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,750
a prologue to unparalleled fear

267
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,430
was quietly but steadily unfolding.

268
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,530
Not enough.

269
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,770
These creatures are not enough,
no matter how many I eat.

270
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,810
But I cannot move...

271
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,940
Stay calm.

272
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,900
Focus on recovering my energy.

273
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,620
I must heal before I can take the next step.

274
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,000
I have a duty to fulfill...

275
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,500
I must give birth to the King!

276
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,290
I am the Queen!

277
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Next time: Unease x And x Sighting.

278
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,510
Are you uneasy, Killua?

279
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,420
D-Don't embarrass me!
