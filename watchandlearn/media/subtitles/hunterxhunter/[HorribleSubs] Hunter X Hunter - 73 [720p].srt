00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,230
Tsezgerra
Rodriot
Barry
Kess

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,230
Today is the tenth day.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,730
If they don't return, their data will be erased.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,680
Well, I guess we have to wait
for Goreinu to contact us.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,120
Yes! I got it!

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,740
Look, I've got this down pat.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,370
Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,450
No!

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,250
You might have it down, but you're
still off by a tenth of a second.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,940
Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,030
Now start!

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,380
Man...

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,140
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

15
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,060
Insanity x And x Sanity

16
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,920
It's Goreinu.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,290
What's going on?

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,060
Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,450
since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?

21
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,070
Yeah.

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,700
I can tell you now they won't be returning.

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,810
Why not?

24
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,080
Genthru's team is camping the starting point.

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,790
We decided beforehand that they
wouldn't return to the game

26
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,330
until I sent an all clear signal.

27
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,750
I understand.

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,390
But their card data will disappear.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,900
They'll notice if none of the four
have any important cards!

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,450
They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?

33
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah, in five more minutes,
their card data will be wiped.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
Essentially, they'll be out of it.

35
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,990
To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10.

36
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,450
But do you really think they've given up?

37
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,790
Absolutely.

38
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,620
Given that they took Battera and ran.

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,870
It was a desperate attempt to
keep us from the reward.

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,580
But they spent years collecting
those ninety-six cards.

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,730
Also, I'm wondering why Battera
would send his guards packing.

42
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,760
No idea... Guess something happened.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,030
No point in speculating about it now.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,770
Oh, it's 3:10.

45
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,540
Time's up.

46
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,250
Yay!

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,410
Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!

48
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,030
Fake?

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,390
Yeah,

50
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,410
we switched about thirty of their
ninety-six cards with fakes.

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm the one actually holding
the ninety-six cards.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,170
For such a cautious man, this is the
biggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life.

53
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,300
So I want to make sure it pays off.

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
help you face Genthru's crew.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,290
Understood.

56
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,660
When do you want us to give you the card?

57
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,270
I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.

58
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,190
Good luck.

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,310
Accompany
Warp all players within
20 meters of caster to city
(must have been visited)
or player of your choice
(must have been met
inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

60
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,310
Now it's time to go after those kids.

61
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,320
It wasn't in the plan, but we can
get Patch of Shore from them.

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,160
First, we need more copies of Accompany.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
Okay.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,870
They're on the move.

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,100
Where are you right now?

66
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,650
Near Soufrabi.

67
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,170
They're heading toward Masadora.

68
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,330
Once they're prepared, they'll come for you.

69
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,770
Are you ready?

70
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,270
Absolutely.

71
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,810
We have you guys to thank.

72
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,650
We need more time.

73
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,180
But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,460
Gon!

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Did you let our conversation
distract you and lose track?

76
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,230
Please explain what this is about.

77
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,990
I realize that I was being intrusive,

78
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,510
but I took a look.

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,910
Your daughter?

80
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,250
Or perhaps your granddaughter?

81
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,000
My lover.

82
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,140
She'd been hospitalized for a long time.

83
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,170
She was in a coma.

84
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,590
A few days ago,

85
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,130
she passed away in her sleep.

86
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,430
I suppose she didn't want people
thinking she wanted my money,

87
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,000
because she returned every gift I gave her.

88
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,880
But she loved

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,480
this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.

90
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,060
All we ever needed was one other.

91
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,540
We swore that we would never be apart...

92
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,020
Until the accident

93
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,190
that put her into a sleep from
which she'd never wake...

94
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,560
Indeed...

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,310
She appeared to only be sleeping...

96
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,820
That was when I heard about Greed Island.

97
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:39,710
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

98
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,500
If I beat that game, I could obtain the one thing

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,200
that I need most, like a dream come true.

100
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,050
I was prepared to spend my
fortune on copies of that game.

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,280
But it doesn't matter any longer...

102
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,390
It doesn't matter...

103
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,370
The kids have four copies of
Accompany among them.

104
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,540
We have six.

105
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,670
Shall we go, then?

106
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,520
Yeah.

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,110
Whenever you're ready.

108
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,220
I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,870
Assuming we need to resort to force.

110
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,830
Sub, take the slant-eyed kid.

111
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,340
Bara, you take the girl.

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,850
Accompany on!

113
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,510
Gon!

114
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,760
What do you want?

115
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,850
Don't be so hostile.

116
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,380
We're here to propose a deal.

117
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,750
A deal?

118
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,140
We aren't interested!

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,830
Right, don't let them notice

120
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,520
that we've been waiting for them,
completely prepared.

121
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,070
It's not a bad deal.

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,400
We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,530
What is it?

124
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,830
Interested now?

125
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,400
Stop! Talk from where you are!

126
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,880
Yes, that's good.

127
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,160
We must act like we're at a
significant disadvantage.

128
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,030
We have to convince them

129
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,170
that we're being forced into this position.

130
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,670
It's quite simple.

131
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,710
We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf,
then everyone returns to the real world.

132
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,180
And we'll split Battera's reward.

133
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,430
I find that hard to believe.

134
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,730
We've had a change of heart.

135
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,690
And Tsezgerra has already left the game.

136
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,680
But that doesn't prove that
he agreed to your offer.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
You have a valid point.

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,040
Then, what now?

139
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,440
Do you want to die?

140
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,830
Stop whining, and hand over your cards!

141
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,030
Otherwise, we'll slaughter you!

142
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,750
You've revealed your true colors.

143
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,600
Book!

144
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,910
Accompany on!

145
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,920
To Soufrabi!

146
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,420
Three more times.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,930
Two more times.

148
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,930
One more time...

149
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,930
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

150
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,470
Return on!

151
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,440
To Masadora!

152
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,940
Masadora?

153
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,490
Are they trying to obtain more spell cards?

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,940
They might try to escape to the
real world through the port.

155
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,540
Accompany on.

156
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,160
Gon!

157
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,380
They're not here.

158
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,700
Are they hiding and concealing their presences?

159
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,530
Check at the store.

160
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,920
We don't want to let them buy any spell cards.

161
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,410
They haven't been here.

162
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,960
Did they head for the port?

163
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,970
Tsk, guess we have no choice.

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,950
Accompany on!

165
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,640
Gon!

166
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,910
Don't lose sight of them!

167
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,060
We're out of Accompany cards!

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,820
Now why don't you give up,
and hand over your cards?

169
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,130
No way!

170
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,840
We'll never let you have them!

171
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,200
Everything's gone to plan.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,960
They mean to fight us one-on-one.

173
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,070
If we have to hand over our
cards, we'd rather fight!

174
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,460
Wait, Gon!

175
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,840
Damn...

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,420
Good.

177
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,470
Now we only need to separate them.

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,680
Bisky, you run for it!

179
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,840
B-But...

180
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,180
Just run!

181
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Wait!

182
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Hey, you aren't getting away.

183
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,550
I'm counting on you guys.

184
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,910
You're up against me!

185
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,160
You know that I'm the Bomber?

186
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,040
I heard it from Tsezgerra.

187
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,920
And who told you how my power works?

188
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,650
Incredible.

189
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,430
That moment was enough for him to know

190
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,280
what I'm watching out for and why...

191
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,300
This is the difference in experience between us!

192
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,970
There aren't too many people

193
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,690
who know about my power
and are still alive.

194
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,800
Book!

195
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,090
I can't let him control things.

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,440
I don't like people just taking
cards from other players!

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,950
So let's make a deal.

198
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,310
Whoever surrenders first has
to give up all his cards.

199
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,270
You seem to have the wrong idea.

200
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,090
You're in no position to make demands.

201
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,490
This is your last chance to make a deal.

202
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,050
Otherwise, you're nothing more than a thief.

203
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,180
I'd rather die than hand
over my cards to a thief!

204
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,430
You can kill me, but I still
won't take out my binder!

205
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,350
You're insane.

206
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,370
And I don't mean my kind of insane.

207
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,350
Very well.

208
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,700
You have a deal.

209
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,820
Book.

210
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,310
I'm holding one hundred thirty-one cards.

211
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,200
I have ninety-seven of the restricted slot cards.

212
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,120
I have one hundred and two cards.

213
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,330
And seventy-one of the restricted slot cards.

214
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,380
Book.

215
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,480
You have #2 and #75, correct?

216
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,740
Yeah.

217
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,370
Book.

218
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,300
That's all I need.

219
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,380
An excellent show of Ren...

220
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,280
But clearly, he has much
room for improvement.

221
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,920
Offense is the strongest defense.

222
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,440
You're strong enough that

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,360
a single explosion won't be
enough to finish you off.

224
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,120
So stay on the attack!

225
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,780
This kid has skill.

226
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,170
But his use of aura is sloppy at best.

227
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,420
Not sure why he was so confident.

228
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,870
At this point, you're nowhere near his level.

229
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,870
You won't be able to deal significant damage.

230
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,020
But continue to attack!

231
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,230
Because he will still defeat you.

232
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,240
You still haven't answered my question.

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,380
Who told you about my power?

234
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,070
Well, it isn't important now.

235
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,500
My point is

236
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,750
that I don't need my ability to deal with you.

237
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,250
All according to plan.

238
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,830
Once he's seen how much stronger he is,

239
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,680
we'll begin to lure him into our trap!

240
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,000
Osu!

241
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,120
That's how I'd like to respond...

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,390
But I don't like the idea of
being totally manhandled.

243
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,050
I'll make him use his power...

244
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,010
I'll carry out the plan afterwards!

245
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,790
Looks like you need a little more pain!

246
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,260
Use your power.

247
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,510
I have a surprise for you!

248
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,520
I see what you're thinking.

249
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,140
I won't use it!

250
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,660
Damned kid!

251
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,990
She's faster than I expected.

252
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,070
Book!

253
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,500
She should be out of teleportation spells.

254
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,240
What's she doing?

255
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,000
She used Transform to hide
it as a different card?

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,860
Accompany on!

257
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,950
To Soufrabi!

258
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,370
Accompany?

259
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,380
Why?

260
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,020
I don't get it...

261
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,780
Why would you go to all this
trouble to be alone with me?

262
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,010
One reason...

263
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,820
Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.

264
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,850
Huh?

265
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,980
I have no idea what you're talking about.

266
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,200
You're such a fool...

267
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,580
I'm telling you that I'm stronger.

268
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,270
Damned brat!

269
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,900
Your attacks are too weak...

270
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,730
You can't defeat me!

271
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,540
I won't hold back...

272
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,990
So don't blame me.

273
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,800
That's what I was going to say.

274
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,630
I was being nice, so I let you hit me once.

275
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,590
Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.

276
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,620
And I end up killing my opponents!

277
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,730
Oh, you're alive?

278
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,170
I'm impressed.

279
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,730
Why would you...

280
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,180
hide your power?

281
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,570
Two reasons...

282
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,260
The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...

283
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,670
And more than anything, I hate the way I look.

284
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,040
Too macho!

285
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,990
Don't you agree?

286
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,330
He can't hear me anymore?

287
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,920
I have a slight advantage in martial
skill and physical strength.

288
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,690
But he has me beat in aura capacity.

289
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,610
I probably won't be able to hurt
him with any normal attack.

290
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,490
Which makes him perfect to experiment on.

291
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
Damn...

292
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,570
I felt that hit inside my head.

293
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,990
I can't afford to fool around.

294
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,460
Wrong.

295
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,760
Experiment #1...

296
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,350
Lightning Palm!

297
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,220
Lightning Palm

298
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,040
Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.

299
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,750
But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.

300
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,810
Okay.

301
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,480
Experiment #2...

302
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,980
A yo-yo?

303
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,490
Let's do this.

304
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,490
What's he up to?

305
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,160
What's that thing made of?

306
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,630
This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.

307
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,130
It weighs around fifty kilograms,

308
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,390
so it packs quite a punch!

309
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,890
Whoa!

310
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
Damn...

311
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,760
Between the weight and centrifugal
force, that really hurts.

312
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,830
He always leaves his right side exposed

313
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,510
when I attack a certain way!

314
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,950
If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed,

315
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,870
he'll make the same mistake!

316
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,550
My chance!

317
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,530
There!

318
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,420
Yes!

319
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,050
Time to crush you!

320
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,010
Oh?

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,690
Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?

322
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,450
Wow, you're still conscious?

323
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,150
Did you know that

324
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,360
when you kick me, you raise your
guarding arm on the other side?

325
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,700
You're creating your own blind spot.

326
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,590
He used my blind spot to pull
out a yo-yo and attack?

327
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,210
Then your defensive habit...

328
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,720
Was a fake to make you
kick me with your left leg.

329
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,050
And when you released your first yo-yo...

330
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,850
I knew you picked up something to throw at me.

331
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,720
Why did you use Accompany to
draw me away from the others?

332
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,980
To make you focus on a one-on-one chance,
so you'd lose track of your surroundings.

333
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,330
I don't believe it..

334
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,490
You set three traps during that brief exchange?

335
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,700
Three?

336
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,500
You must be joking...

337
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,870
Every move I made was a trap.

338
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,910
Experiment complete!

339
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,280
Both work.

340
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,130
Why won't you accept your fate?

341
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,500
You can't beat me.

342
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,610
No way.

343
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,770
I...

344
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,800
I haven't lost yet!

345
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,900
I was mistaken.

346
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,130
I take back what I said.

347
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,870
You are strong...

348
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,890
I will show you my power.

349
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,080
This battle is mental, not physical.

350
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,860
I must crush his will.

351
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,670
His will to fight, his will to stand,

352
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,670
his will to resist.

353
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,510
Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat...

354
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,900
To win, I must swallow my
pride and play it smart.

355
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:38,110
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!

356
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,690
Here he comes.

357
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,620
The devilish man has unleashed his true power.

358
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,830
Can Gon emerge victorious?

359
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,110
G.I. Tutorial

360
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,840
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

361
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,700
Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel.

362
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:19,160
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

363
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,900
A card that can cure injury and disease.

364
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,690
Mito-san used this all the time.

365
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,310
Huh?

366
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,870
Boo-boos, begone!

367
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,290
Continue!

368
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,420
Next time: Victor x And x Loser.

369
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,260
Ow! That hurts...

370
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,380
What's wrong, Killua?

371
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,200
My tooth hurts...

372
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,390
Good kids always brush their teeth.
