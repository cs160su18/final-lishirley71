2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,670
This is a bullet casing.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,910
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,450
So the underground rulers of NGL

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,520
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,140
But judging by this...

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,250
It wasn't done by a human.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,000
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,050
The x Fight x Begins

10
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,310
The Chimera Ants continue their
rampage throughout NGL.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,780
And they've finally struck against the don

12
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,210
who ruled this country from the shadows.

13
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,400
It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,190
have assumed control of NGL's interior.

15
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,080
The question is if we can reach their nest

16
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,080
before the Queen births the King.

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
More!

18
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,080
More!

19
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,310
I need much more.

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,500
I need more food of high
nutritional value for my child.

21
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,020
Over a hundred a day?

22
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,460
Yes, the Queen has requested

23
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,380
more food, to aid the King's growth.

24
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,290
We've been providing fifty a day.

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,870
Just when we'd managed

26
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,390
to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...

27
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,390
If the Queen commands,

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,390
we will double or triple our quota.

29
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,980
We should increase our ranks...

30
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,720
No.

31
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,260
Increasing them would be simple, but it
would disturb the chain of command.

32
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,710
We must start by instilling more discipline.

33
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,640
We'll increase our ranks afterwards.

34
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,720
First, we must eliminate sedition in all—

35
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,140
Don't make me laugh!

36
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,670
That isn't going to be necessary.

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,670
The rare human I captured has the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones.

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,830
One with the value of a thousand?

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,430
What are you talking about?

40
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,860
You didn't know?

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.

42
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,110
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.

43
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,970
Rare?

44
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,970
These special humans each have the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones?

45
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,950
That's right.

46
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,120
Impossible!

47
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,210
No such human could—

48
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,950
They do exist...

49
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,330
I saw and fought one.

50
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,420
And then, I accidentally took a bite!

51
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,740
Pike!

52
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,800
The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.

53
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,790
Oh, yeah.

54
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,140
You're right.

55
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,990
Don't spout nonsense!

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,310
Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama.

57
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,680
I spoke nonsense? When?

58
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,540
You weren't the one who
captured the rare human.

59
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,440
I did.

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,440
Remember how you praised me
for the wonderful job I did?

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm the one who disabled him!

62
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,450
But I'm the one who held him in place—

63
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
Enough.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Make yourself scarce.

65
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,230
F-For...

66
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,840
Forgive me!

67
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,300
Was that story true?

68
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,330
Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama...

69
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,310
Yes, there really was a rare human.

70
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,560
Not that!

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,810
Did you really take a bite?

72
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,880
No, I took a bite of the normal
human, not of the rare—

73
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,620
It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.

74
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,330
Consuming the Queen's food

75
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,530
is not permitted.

76
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,540
I'll never do it again,

77
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,880
so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!

78
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,560
Hold it! Come back here!

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,550
Bihorn.

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,610
Have you ever seen a rare human?

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,280
No, I've only heard about them from Zazan.

82
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,100
Zazan,

83
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,480
could you provide more detail
about this rare human?

84
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,110
Sure.

85
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,050
Arrows of light...

86
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,200
I understand.

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.

88
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,210
Yes, that must be it.

89
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,120
One mystery has been solved.

90
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,030
While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers,

91
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,560
an officer like Pike can see them.

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,130
See them and stop them.

93
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,330
In other words, officers can capture them.

94
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,390
Yes, like I did.

95
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,840
That one was clearly different from
the other humans we've captured.

96
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,400
Its whole body appeared to
be shining with life energy.

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,090
That's how I knew

98
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,310
that it would have the nutritional
value of over a thousand humans.

99
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,910
More than ten days' worth in one human?

100
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,410
If that's true, we're saved.

101
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,330
It'd be far easier than carrying

102
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,420
a hundred humans around each day.

103
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,520
If we find one on the first day,
we can rest the next nine.

104
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,490
Fool!

105
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,410
They're rare because they're hard to find!

106
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,180
What? Again?

107
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,540
Understood.

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,090
Is something wrong?

109
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,630
Rammot is acting without my permission again.

110
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,270
Damn!

111
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,960
Why am I stuck eating horses?

112
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,990
Damn...

113
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
This is all Colt's fault.

114
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,820
I want to eat humans!

115
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,890
First, I have to deal with Rammot.

116
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,880
Otherwise, it sets a bad example.

117
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,240
What is this presence?

118
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,420
Could it be?

119
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,540
No one's here.

120
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,880
Say...

121
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Something smells.

122
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,740
Coming from over there.

123
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,310
It's like a morning sacrifice.

124
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,370
A ritual practiced by birds
called bull-headed shrikes.

125
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,930
They impale their prey on sharp
objects, such as branches.

126
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,420
Hey!

127
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,230
Wha?

128
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,130
Wh-What is that?

129
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,060
They're capable of concealing their presence?

130
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,090
Trash.

131
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,400
Those are mine!

132
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,760
Ow!

133
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,550
This guy is strong.

134
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,590
Fighting him won't be easy.

135
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,040
Gon... Killua...

136
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,300
You two must deal with him yourselves.

137
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,000
That is a Chimera Ant soldier.

138
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,180
We will encounter many more like him.

139
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,940
I won't be able to help you during combat.

140
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,650
If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave.

141
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,440
You'll just be in my way.

142
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,530
Weren't you listening, Kite?

143
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,430
We are also pros!

144
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,490
Don't treat us like kids!

145
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,750
What trick is this?

146
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,570
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.

147
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,420
Time to test it!

148
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,470
Thunderbolt

149
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,470
Thunderbolt!

150
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,270
First comes rock...

151
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,980
Rock...

152
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,530
Paper...

153
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,370
Rock!

154
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,320
Yes! Just enough!

155
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,020
Bastards!

156
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,050
I'm gonna eat you!

157
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,560
I will! Remember this!

158
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,780
Our attacks...

159
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,750
They didn't work.

160
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,410
That guy's smart.

161
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,040
He let his soldier do the fighting,
so he could learn our abilities.

162
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,810
Are you coming?

163
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:12,210
There's no need to feel down.
Your attacks weren't that bad.

164
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,250
You just need experience now.

165
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,030
If you wish to become stronger,
this is a perfect opportunity.

166
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,660
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.

167
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,450
Whether we win or lose,

168
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,440
hell lies ahead of us.

169
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,740
We're coming.

170
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,290
Yeah.

171
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,020
That hurts...

172
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,850
Damn...

173
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,930
Don't lay a finger on them.

174
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,610
I'm gonna get my revenge.

175
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,490
I'll kill them...

176
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,490
I'll eat them all!

177
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm willing to let you kill them.

178
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,500
But you may not eat them.

179
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,500
Bodies brimming with so much life
energy provide the finest nutrition.

180
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,760
They must be fed to the Queen.

181
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,800
No way! Killing them won't be enough!

182
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,270
I have to tear them to shreds,
fill my belly with them...

183
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,770
Crap on their skulls, and crush them!

184
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,770
And even still...

185
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,980
That still may not be enough to quell my fury!

186
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,780
I won't be satisfied with just killing them!

187
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,120
Don't get above yourself.

188
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,670
This is an order.

189
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,410
You would defy your leader's command?

190
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,020
It isn't just Yunju's team.

191
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,300
The other teams do it all the time.

192
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,260
Cheetu and Hagya's teams
do whatever they want.

193
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,550
Their leaders enjoy the hunt!

194
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,340
Is that true?

195
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,310
Yeah!

196
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,300
They chase humans, kill them,

197
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,310
then leave the dead bodies there.

198
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,530
None of the other squadrons just haul
bodies back like industrious little drones,

199
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,540
my dear leader Colt.

200
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,670
I'll transfer to a different squad if
that's what it takes to kill them.

201
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,630
Damn, it hurts!

202
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,200
A reason?

203
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,090
Because it's fun, of course.

204
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,780
It's good that humans know how to speak.

205
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,100
That way, we know what
they think as they die.

206
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,390
I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.

207
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,390
Yep, it's great!

208
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,500
Once you've tried it, you can never go back.

209
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,110
Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?

210
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,730
You're wrong about one thing...

211
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,620
Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.

212
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,270
We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.

213
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,250
However...

214
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,220
You shouldn't waste the Queen's
precious food for sport.

215
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,390
Precious food?

216
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,130
Don't make me laugh.

217
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,190
There are more of them than she'll ever need.

218
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,720
They're trash!

219
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,860
I'm just taking out the trash.

220
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,240
Got a problem with that?

221
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,050
Not at all!

222
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,650
Do you know about the rare humans?

223
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,540
Rare humans?

224
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh...

225
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,280
The ones that are overflowing with life energy?

226
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,160
I haven't seen one yet.

227
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,530
If you do, capture it alive and bring it back.

228
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,460
Fine.

229
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,680
I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.

230
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,080
Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down.

231
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,690
I'll take that as a promise.

232
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,510
Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?

233
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,770
Let's find a rare one and eat it.

234
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,980
Let's eat!

235
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,330
How's Rammot doing?

236
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,330
Tonight will be critical.

237
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,450
But his anger and stamina
should see him through it.

238
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,480
Still, our army seems to have
too much personality.

239
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,720
Having multiple perspectives helps,

240
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,040
but too many are self-centered.

241
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,810
We're meeting our quota, so there's
nothing to worry about.

242
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,490
You're one to talk.

243
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,900
Are you counting the humans you capture?

244
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,420
Hmm... Kind of.

245
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,500
That doesn't count.

246
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,410
Perhaps we should have everyone
assemble to discuss this.

247
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,890
No, we operate at different times now.

248
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,260
Assembling everyone is impossible.

249
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,750
I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.

250
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,250
What about the Queen?

251
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,530
She's busy nourishing the King.

252
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,680
We can't distract her.

253
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,570
I'll handle this.

254
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,590
Sounds tough.
Don't ruin your health.

255
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,000
If you're honestly concerned,
try to control yourself.

256
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,990
This is ugly...

257
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,780
The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.

258
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,340
Look at this.

259
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,350
So this is the hidden side of NGL.

260
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,720
I suppose so.

261
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,980
Killua... Kite...

262
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,590
The silence of the drug factory
overtaken by the Chimera Ants

263
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,200
further intensifies the chill in the air.

264
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,370
What awaits Gon and his friends there?

265
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,400
Next time: Kite x And x Slots.

266
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,940
Start the slots!
