00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,730
Th-Thank you very much...

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,240
Why did you not call for help?

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,240
Here...

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,400
And here...

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,990
You're covered in blood!

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,640
What is this creature?

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,530
What do I want

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,620
to do with her?

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,090
Taking Stock x And x Taking Action

11
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,990
One day remains before the selection.

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,730
The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning.

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,610
Good morning.

14
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,390
You boys are up early.

15
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,120
We have nineteen hours until
midnight strikes on selection day.

16
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,160
Tonight, we finally make our move.

17
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,120
Let's do one final check.

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Once inside, Gon and I

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,020
immediately head up the central stairway,
toward the throne room.

20
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,440
Yep.

21
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,880
Ikalgo will take

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,600
the northeast elevator down to the
basement, to search for Palm.

23
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,320
If you find her, escape without us.

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,140
Right.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,350
If the King and his three Royal Guards
are in the throne room,

26
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,150
we proceed with the plan.

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,530
The problem is, what if they're not there?

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,500
You're really hung up on that...

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,390
What are the chances of that happening?

30
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,900
Well, it's highly unlikely.

31
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,450
But the unusual happens pretty often.

32
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,540
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

33
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,320
We researched the enemy's behavior extensively
before deciding on a day for the attack.

34
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,430
When you're waiting for someone to be
in a certain place, at a certain time,

35
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,800
that's typically when the unexpected happens.

36
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,500
In my old job, I saw this all the time.

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,470
The unusual always happens
on the day you've chosen.

38
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,050
In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,570
to ensure my success.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,100
But this time, that isn't an option.

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,370
We can't wait.

42
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,330
Once we move, there's no turning back.

43
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,720
A moment's hesitation can mean death!

44
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,080
So we should take time now to decide

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,460
how we'll act in different situations.

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,070
Even if they aren't in the throne room,
if they're still in the palace, it's okay.

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,790
Pitou's En is enough to cover the palace and
its surrounding courtyards, and then some.

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,100
So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,390
we'll know that they're there.

50
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,510
From there, we just follow that
sinister aura to where it feels densest,

51
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,470
and they'll be at its center.

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,680
The question is what we do if
we don't sense Pitou's aura.

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,360
In other words, what we do
if they aren't in the palace.

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,450
Or if they're in the palace,
but they aren't using En.

55
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,450
Would they be in the palace,

56
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,120
but not using En to guard the King?

57
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,500
That's what happened when
Knov-san infiltrated the palace!

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,510
Huh?

59
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,390
Yes, that's what I can't make sense of.

60
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,890
According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura.

61
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,070
The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.

62
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,570
So if Pouf was there, the other two were
also in the palace with the King.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,220
Then, why did Pitou stop
using the puppets and En,

64
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,060
leaving Pouf to handle security,

65
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,640
which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?

66
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,590
I believe the reason has to do with
how Pitou's power works...

67
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,600
Then we should ask Colt.

68
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,720
Yeah.

69
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,510
I'd guess that during that time,
Pitou was healing someone.

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,800
Healing?

71
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,060
I told you that Pitou was the
one who restored Kite, yes?

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,060
Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou
used En during that period.

73
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,120
Thus, healing must require a
great deal of concentration.

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,320
So while healing someone,

75
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,570
Pitou cannot use En or the puppets.

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
Now it makes sense.

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,870
Which means that someone,

78
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,300
most likely the King or one of the
Royal Guard, was injured and

79
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
required healing, so the En
and puppets disappeared.

80
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,710
But hold on...

81
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,710
Who would have been able to
injure one of those monsters?

82
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,110
True...

83
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,960
An internal dispute?

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,870
Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,220
No, that's impossible.

86
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,860
There is no chance that Pitou
would endanger the King

87
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,590
by removing that En to heal someone else!

88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,800
I guarantee it.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,320
Which means that the one injured...

90
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,130
...was the King!

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,990
I see... What you're saying makes sense.

92
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,500
But then the bigger question
is who injured the King.

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,330
The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.

94
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,750
But other soldiers could never put
so much as a scratch on him.

95
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,260
Yep, so our conclusion was...

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
The King injured himself?!

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,320
Under what circumstances
would that have happened?

98
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,760
We don't know why, but it's the only explanation.

99
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,550
I'll admit that I didn't question our
sudden stroke of luck too much...

100
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,610
But that chance was only possible
under abnormal circumstances.

101
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,590
Are they starting to lose control?

102
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,260
That isn't good...

103
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,760
I'm starting to think something's
going on inside the palace.

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,170
We will now begin moving to the palace.

105
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,910
Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in
Diego Plaza at once.

106
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,610
The citizens of the other sectors
should prepare to move out.

107
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,980
Oh, they're starting to file out.

108
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,630
They've begun their march...

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts.

110
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,890
In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,060
five million humans will fill the palace grounds.

112
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,520
Has the situation in Peijing changed?

113
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,010
I thought it was only one skilled enemy,
but now there are a bunch.

114
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,190
So there are reinforcements.

115
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,650
They may try to use the celebration
as cover to approach us.

116
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,800
Then the danger will be greatest
during the selection.

117
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,630
Yes, since the King will be
participating in the selection.

118
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,010
Our greatest concern is

119
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,810
the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,650
Assuming that they have a Nen
user capable of translocation,

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,920
and that that person can use the ability
to isolate the King somewhere else...

122
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,090
That means at least one of us must stay

123
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,720
by the King's side during the selection.

124
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,710
The King won't allow it.

125
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,490
As it is, he's been upset by how
close we've stayed to him.

126
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,730
Then we guard him secretly,
without his knowledge.

127
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,780
We need someone to stay just close
enough to monitor his surroundings

128
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,140
while still carrying out his own role in the selection...

129
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,650
Whose size won't attract attention,

130
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,000
who won't get absorbed in an amusing task...

131
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,760
Very well, I am the best choice for this.

132
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,720
Strictly by process of elimination, of course...

133
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,320
What's wrong?

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,510
Their presences have completely disappeared.

135
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,380
I can't sense any residual aura.

136
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,050
They must be using Zetsu to hide
among the marching humans.

137
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,210
Hey.

138
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,580
There are so many people...

139
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,460
Around a hundred per building.

140
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,900
They must have been packed inside.

141
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,470
Then if we conceal our presences,

142
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,500
they can only assume that we're
hiding among the citizens.

143
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,220
Maybe they'll cancel the march?

144
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,720
No way.

145
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,970
That would mean delaying or
even canceling the celebration.

146
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,230
Which would imply the King had
accepted defeat and compromised.

147
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,460
The Royal Guard won't let that happen.

148
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,340
The celebration will begin as scheduled,
no matter the cost.

149
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,670
Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!

150
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,500
And that won't change.

151
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,050
Once the humans began to move,

152
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,410
my puppets could no longer tell them apart...

153
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,090
Should I recall them?

154
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,260
No, giving the enemy free
rein would be dangerous.

155
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,570
Have the puppets join the soldiers that
are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent.

156
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,070
'Sup?

157
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,820
As expected, the puppets have joined the march.

158
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,520
In another hour, those sectors will be deserted.

159
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,170
There are six entrances to the
rooms that lead to the palace.

160
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,090
We'll avoid the entrances in front of the
palace, where security will be tighter,

161
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,320
and wait by entrances A, B,
and C, behind the palace.

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,510
Once we've entered the rooms,

163
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,480
the only exit will lead inside the palace.

164
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,860
What? You scared?

165
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,060
Don't be absurd.

166
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,110
I merely want to be sure we're prepared.

167
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,530
Waiting by the entrances involves
quite a lot of risk.

168
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,350
But if we enter the rooms too early,
we won't be able to exit until midnight.

169
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,290
True...

170
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,840
If we receive any useful information,

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,130
we want to be free to act on it...

172
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,450
And we can't use cell phones near the palace,

173
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,240
since the Ants will pick up on the signal.

174
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,830
I think it's dangerous to spend hours
waiting inside the rooms,

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,770
not knowing if there have been
accidents or changes in the situation.

176
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,240
But you're the one who said it was
risky to wait outside the palace.

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,150
Yes...

178
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,340
You shouldn't take their security net lightly.

179
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,680
I'll take care of it.

180
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,910
I'm the only one who can freely
enter and exit these rooms.

181
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,460
If anything happens, I'll tell you.

182
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,590
For now, you should rest here.

183
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,300
Will you be okay?

184
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,270
I shouldn't have any problem
investigating the area...

185
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,430
Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long
as I'm out of range of Pitou's En...

186
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,190
But you should be careful.

187
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
Pitou doesn't use a standard circular En.

188
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,030
It changes shape like an amoeba,
giving it extended range.

189
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,820
That's what Kite came in contact with.

190
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,860
And it was probably deliberate...

191
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,710
It's a fighter's instinct to want to know
how strong the opponent is.

192
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,850
And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.

193
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,240
In some areas, that En can
stretch two kilometers.

194
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,600
Make sure you stay out of range.

195
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,890
Don't worry about it.

196
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,930
In this room, I'm the one who most fears them.

197
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,350
I won't do anything crazy.

198
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,150
I promise you that.

199
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,380
We will now head to the palace.

200
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,950
Any person who leaves their line
will be shot on the spot.

201
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,450
Move out!

202
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,420
Pitou...

203
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,300
You knew that Komugi was being attacked?

204
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,480
Yes, I was monitoring the area with En.

205
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,560
However,

206
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,570
I determined that there was no threat
to Your Majesty, so I ignored it.

207
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,440
From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,

208
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,780
and deal with any threats at once.

209
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,200
Yes, as you command.

210
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,720
Tens of thousands of people are marching

211
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,390
in a line toward the King.

212
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,370
Like ants... No, lemmings.

213
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,910
A march of death.

214
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,230
It will be dark soon.

215
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,180
I can tell Morel and the
others to come out...

216
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,550
What is

217
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,010
that?

218
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,220
Wing scales?

219
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,630
The wind is carrying the scales of
his wings toward the citizens...

220
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,170
That means...

221
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,300
As I thought...

222
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,780
They all look completely vacant and dazed.

223
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,630
Those scales have a hypnotic effect.

224
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,690
Stay in line as you advance!

225
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,740
Stay in line!

226
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,810
Once you reach your position, wait for orders.

227
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,370
Do not move!

228
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,370
Simple orders delivered repeatedly,
while tanks roll in the background

229
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,030
can easily seep into a mind exhausted
from hours of marching...

230
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,380
It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!

231
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,150
Once the selection begins,
and blood starts to fly,

232
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,470
they will continue to quietly stand in place.

233
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,710
Until it's their turn.

234
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,230
Hypnosis? I see...

235
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,180
If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run.

236
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,110
But this works out for us.

237
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,070
Eh?

238
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,330
If we make a lot of noise,

239
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,600
we won't have to worry about citizens panicking.

240
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,620
Ah!

241
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,830
There won't be any stampede of humans
falling over each other to escape.

242
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,880
That's a big boon.

243
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,360
Assuming that over half of the people
will be in place at midnight,

244
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,790
we would have expected a stampede to
leave tens of thousands of casualties.

245
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,520
Our biggest concern has been addressed.

246
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,270
We can go crazy.

247
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,900
Six hours to go.

248
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,450
Everyone's here.

249
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,830
Have you heard from Palm?

250
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,150
No.

251
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,950
Oh...

252
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,900
We'll keep waiting until half
an hour before go time.

253
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,960
If we knew what's inside before
going in, it'd be very different...

254
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,070
Yeah.

255
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,000
They both look composed.

256
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,780
Killua, in particular, shows

257
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,220
none of the mental weakness he
displayed when we fought.

258
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,320
I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.

259
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,830
But for some reason,

260
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,470
he seems on the verge of fading away.

261
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,770
No, I don't have time to worry about others.

262
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,870
I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.

263
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,760
The fate of humanity rests on me...

264
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,380
Colt is a good guy...

265
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,880
Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.

266
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,390
It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants.
Everyone has a heart.

267
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,900
That's what I want to believe.

268
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,890
Hopefully, the King also has one.

269
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,520
But some of them must be killed...

270
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,760
If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,490
Kite, it's almost time.

272
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,530
I promise to turn you back...

273
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,320
By defeating that Ant.

274
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,090
He's fired up...

275
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,040
I'll focus on providing support.

276
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,290
So no one can interfere in your battle...

277
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,510
Using my new Kanmuru technique.

278
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,500
My body feels heavy.

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm suffering from days without rest...

280
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,180
On a scale of 1 to 100, my current
condition would be 40...

281
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,890
No, 35...

282
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,330
But I can't be whining now.

283
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,480
With Knov out, I'm the only one left.

284
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,990
I was hoping to fight at full strength,

285
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,810
but it's easier to accept my fate this way.

286
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,750
I'll focus on playing the decoy and
drawing my target from the King.

287
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,390
I'm sorry, Morel and everyone...

288
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,750
But I can't bring myself to go.

289
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,850
I'll take a look outside.

290
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,030
So two minutes is the longest
I can hold my breath...

291
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,240
Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit
will probably be, at most, half that.

292
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,270
Good enough...

293
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,990
One minute is more than enough time!

294
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,300
Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn.

295
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,750
A few days ago, I couldn't have
dreamed of such a life.

296
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,750
Thank you, Killua.

297
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,480
I promise to carry out my mission for you!

298
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,300
Tomorrow will be my birthday!

299
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,280
I am the King.

300
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,370
But who am I?

301
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
Why was I brought into this world?

302
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,430
Time's up... Let's go!

303
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Palm...

304
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,870
Ten minutes remain until
they enter the palace.

305
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,140
Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.

306
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,180
It's so cold, Gon...

307
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,970
They said Admiral Winter is coming!

308
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,260
I think you mean General Winter.
