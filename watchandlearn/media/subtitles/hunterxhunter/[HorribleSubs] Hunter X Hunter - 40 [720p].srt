00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,720
There are six distinct categories of Nen users.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,110
Enhancer.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,030
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,960
Transmuter.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,740
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,220
Conjurer.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,140
Emitter.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,460
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,860
Manipulator.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,440
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
Specialist.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,690
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,720
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,030
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled Nen user.

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,830
There's one month before the auction begins.

18
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,600
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,

19
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,040
and bring it here.

20
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,560
If you are successful, you will be hired,

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,020
and begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.

22
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,270
The man talking was, most likely,
not the actual employer.

23
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,990
That only illustrates the distance
between the boss and me...

24
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,290
I shall reduce that distance to zero,

25
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,590
until the employer feels that he
can trust me with his secrets...

26
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,860
I will pass this test.

27
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,070
First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,080
Nen x Users x Unite?

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,410
Hmm? The door won't open.

30
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,840
I forgot to mention one thing.

31
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,430
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...

32
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,990
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,070
Dowsing Chain
The Guiding Ring Finger Chain

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,020
That's impressive.

35
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,940
He used a chain to catch the bullets?

36
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,540
Three with guns.

37
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,480
Six with swords.

38
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,300
Two more with swords above.

39
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,030
You guys did a good job
of concealing your presences,

40
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,350
but you're too weak.

41
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,930
I don't even need to use my Nen...

42
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,360
Now I understand.

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,650
So that's what's going on.

44
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,670
He's the one.

45
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Stop them.

46
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,530
I'll give you three seconds.

47
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,040
One...

48
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,680
Two...

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,290
Okay.

50
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,310
I get it.

51
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,080
Wh-What's going on?

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,440
They really were made from Nen.

53
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,150
I could tell when I landed a punch,

54
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,440
that I was hitting aura shaped like a human...

55
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,530
However,

56
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,170
I didn't realize it was his Nen.

57
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,310
How did you know?

58
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,580
You were always careful to stand
next to others for camouflage.

59
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,290
But when I observed from above,
everything was clear.

60
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,420
You were the only person not under attack.

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,960
I realized something was wrong

62
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,430
when assailants appeared on the second floor.

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,100
After I jumped on the chandelier,

64
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,590
they just stood there, swords swinging

65
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,730
in a futile attempt to reach me.

66
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,280
I assume they received the following order:

67
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,480
Attack the nearest enemy.

68
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,870
The assailants were given
simple instructions,

69
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,740
so their attacks were also simple.

70
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,120
However, it would take a skilled Nen user

71
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,420
to control eleven human-sized
auras simultaneously.

72
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,210
A Nen user who would most
likely be a Manipulator.

73
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,900
Given the size of auras involved,

74
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,720
the Manipulator had to be
within a few meters.

75
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,430
Which meant that the Nen user

76
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,930
was inside this room.

77
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
You nailed it.

78
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,840
My name is Shachmono Tocino.

79
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,620
I'm actually a Hunter.

80
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,890
I work for the boss here,

81
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,740
so I will have seniority over you.

82
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,610
Now that everything's clear,
could you drop the knife?

83
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,840
Judging by those chains,
you must be a Manipulator...

84
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,120
Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge.

85
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,940
I was just following orders from the boss.

86
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,710
"Test them by trying to kill them."

87
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,480
But I never expected you to
pick up on me so fast.

88
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,500
Well, the four of you together

89
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,680
should be able to escape this mansion.

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,860
Good luck.

91
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,360
Four?

92
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,300
Is there another plant in the room?

93
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,620
I'll assume that was meant as a diversion.

94
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,500
But either way, it was a mistake.

95
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,170
I shall determine if there
are any other plants,

96
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,180
before we all start becoming paranoid.

97
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,430
There.

98
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,460
You are a plant.

99
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,420
Th-That's ridiculous!

100
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,150
What makes you say that?

101
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,910
Your chain just started swinging.

102
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,030
That is dowsing.

103
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,410
Huh? What's that?

104
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,040
Dowsing was originally

105
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,000
a technique for locating water
or metals underground.

106
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,380
But it was also used in divination.

107
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,180
I've heard of the technique being
employed as a lie detector.

108
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,020
That still doesn't

109
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,180
provide concrete proof that I'm a plant.

110
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,770
He's probably right.

111
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,440
Your heart began to pound as
soon as he pointed at you.

112
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,620
If you were innocent,

113
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,660
your heart rate would have slowly increased,

114
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
due to the stress of being wrongly accused.

115
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,330
But your heartbeat immediately sped up,

116
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,570
before gradually slowing down.

117
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,420
The typical melody of a liar...

118
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,010
Coming from both of you.

119
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,790
I'm convinced.

120
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,180
Both of them accuse you.

121
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,110
That's two of the remaining five.

122
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,300
Wait! Hold on!

123
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,150
That doesn't make it true.

124
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,530
It's possible

125
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,080
that three out of five are
applicants and two are fakes.

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,070
I can confirm

127
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,580
that he is not a plant.

128
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,960
Excuse me?

129
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,790
I think you meant "she," not "he."

130
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,710
And it appears that you
are not a plant, either.

131
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,770
My point is that we can't trust you!

132
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,010
You two could be working together.

133
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,400
A-Anyway, this is a waste of time.

134
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,970
We won't get anywhere by standing around.

135
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,730
No other choice, then.
I will have to settle this
matter on my own.

136
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,000
"Everything that comes
into contact with my fist
will completely burn."

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
Huh?

138
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,210
This is my special power...

139
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,750
Great Haikuist!

140
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,010
Great Haikuist
Wandering Haiku Poet

141
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,060
Damn it all to hell.
It didn't burn very well.
That was a failure.

142
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,240
That was a haiku,

143
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,510
the prized literary art of my homeland.

144
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,240
When I read a haiku, it happens.

145
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,720
There's your explanation.

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,610
Back to the subject at hand.

147
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,940
"Any person who
responds untruthfully to
my question will burn."

148
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,850
In other words, liars will burn in hell.

149
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,980
Here is my question.

150
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,100
Are you a plant?

151
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,980
No.

152
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
What about you?

153
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,730
I am not.

154
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,740
And you?

155
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,490
No.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,020
Are you a plant?

157
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,250
Yeah, that's right.

158
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,750
Think carefully before you answer.

159
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,700
Are you a plant?

160
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,610
Give me your answer!

161
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,020
My answer is yes.

162
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,850
Impressive.

163
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,810
I'll reward you with some information.

164
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,920
My name is Squala.

165
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,290
I don't have an official license,

166
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,310
but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills.

167
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,740
I've used my Manipulator abilities

168
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,290
to instruct something to
follow a certain order.

169
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,720
You managed to unmask me,

170
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,180
but that doesn't mean you'll
be able to escape alive...

171
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,290
What was the something,
and what was the order?

172
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,460
This wouldn't be much of
a test if I just told you.

173
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,540
Fool.

174
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,690
Even if you torture me, I won't talk.

175
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,280
Huh?

176
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,830
This is my power, Instant Lover.

177
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,220
I am also a Manipulator.

178
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,880
Anyone I kiss becomes my slave.

179
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,640
M-M-Mistress...

180
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,580
Take that, and that, and that.
And that... And that!

181
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,990
More!

182
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,850
Please step on me more...

183
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,240
Now, answer my question!

184
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,130
What did you use your Nen on,
and what was your command?

185
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,300
Talk, quickly.

186
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!

187
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,990
I'll talk! I'll talk!

188
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,670
I am just a l-lowly dog trainer...

189
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,100
That is...

190
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,640
A fearsome power.

191
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,920
I used my Nen on the dogs

192
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,270
that run around this mansion.

193
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,990
For example, the Maltese were told to nip

194
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,050
at a target's feet, to slow them.

195
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,260
That's when the St. Bernard is to use
its large body to smother the target.

196
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,970
At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in

197
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,030
and finish off the target...

198
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,180
If the target still escapes,
the bulldogs will—

199
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,490
That's enough...

200
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,790
Release the Nen you used on them!

201
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,200
A-At once!

202
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,500
So the dog tamer has been
reduced to a pet, huh?

203
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,020
Don't say that...

204
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,060
I only did it to make him talk.

205
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,190
If I wanted a man as a pet,
I'd be more picky.

206
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,160
That reminds me,

207
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,260
I never did catch your name.

208
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,450
I'm Basho.

209
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,760
As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer.

210
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,640
I am Baise.

211
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,890
Melody.

212
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,640
It appears you can hear heartbeats.

213
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,210
What category do you fall into?

214
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,960
Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.

215
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,710
Playing coy, huh?

216
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,470
What about you?

217
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,430
I'd like to know your name.

218
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,780
Would you tell us?

219
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,360
I refuse.

220
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,810
We do not know if we'll
be working together.

221
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,030
Yeah, that's true.

222
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,240
We cleared the first test,
escaping the mansion,

223
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,010
but the real test has just begun.

224
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,940
We must locate one of the designated items,

225
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,370
or we can't get the job.

226
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,030
If we're all interested in this job,

227
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,700
we're bound to run into one other again.

228
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,450
What is your opinion of this group?

229
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,370
This particular group looks promising.

230
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,350
More promising than him, at least.

231
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,680
I will not require him for a while.

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,020
Put him away for now.

233
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,330
I trust you can handle that, Squala.

234
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,070
Y-Yes...

235
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,270
If I find one of the objects
and earn the contract,

236
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,280
I will have passage to the
Yorknew City auction.

237
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,800
Yes, I absolutely must attend!

238
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,990
The Phantom Troupe will be there...

239
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,010
The band of thieves

240
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,840
that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.

241
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,660
Our eyes burn a deep scarlet.

242
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,100
Those thieves were willing to
murder to obtain those eyes,

243
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,790
considered one of the world's
top seven beautiful things.

244
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,080
I will never forgive that act.

245
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,970
I shall track them down

246
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,110
and utterly annihilate them!

247
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,370
Hmm, so this is Greed Island.

248
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,490
Looks like the memory card that
Kil found is the real deal.

249
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,130
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?

250
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,870
You bet I can.

251
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,110
I'll strip down the code,
and clear the entire game.

252
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,100
I'll put an end to the legend,

253
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,140
winning fifty billion Jenny in the process.

254
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,760
Oh, right.

255
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,880
This was a trade...

256
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,900
I have to tell Kil the URL for
the Hunter-only website.

257
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,210
If I break my end of the bargain,

258
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,760
he might start talking about breaking
my precious figures again.

259
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,180
There it is, Killua.

260
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,190
Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew.

261
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,860
We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there.

262
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,450
I can't wait!

263
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,450
You're jumping the gun...

264
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,190
We still have two weeks before
we're supposed to meet.

265
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,670
Oh, you're right.

266
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,200
It's been six months since we
saw them, so I'm getting excited!

267
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,260
Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed

268
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,210
that we would come to Yorknew
for a reason like this.

269
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,990
Until we meet again.

270
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, that'll be...

271
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,800
September 1st, in Yorknew City.

272
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,670
The auction begins on September 1st.

273
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,360
We'll have to gather as much information
on Greed Island as possible beforehand.

274
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,850
Yep, there might be information about Ging.

275
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,230
He left a memory card with his message.

276
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,850
There must be a connection.

277
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,740
Anyway, once I get the URL

278
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,610
for the Hunter website from my brother,
we can check it out.

279
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,380
This is it.

280
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,760
My brother sent the URL.

281
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,460
Great!

282
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,950
Let's get started.

283
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,970
Yeah!

284
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,300
Driven by their various goals,

285
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,280
Gon and Killua prepare for September 1st.

286
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:49,080
What will they discover when the
Yorknew City auction begins?

287
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

288
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,400
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

289
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

290
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

291
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

292
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

293
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

294
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,480
Hunterpedia!

295
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:19,750
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

296
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,260
Today, we introduce Melody!

297
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,300
She's a Music Hunter!

298
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,030
Has acute hearing.

299
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,330
She can read your state of mind by your heartbeat.

300
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,830
Able to determine a state of mind
by listening to the heartbeat.

301
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,120
She must have incredible senses.

302
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,230
Hey, Killua. Did you eat my chocolate?

303
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,750
Female.

304
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,880
Nah.

305
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Your face says you're lying.

306
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,060
Next time: Gathering x Of x Heroes!

307
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,540
Killua, I can tell fortunes.

308
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,150
Really?

309
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,360
Everyone who watched
Hunter x Hunter today is happy!
