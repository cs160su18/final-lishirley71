2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,200
You didn't know?

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,420
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,740
Rare?

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,300
What trick is this?

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,090
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,080
Thunderbolt!

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,420
Thunderbolt

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,590
First comes rock...

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,680
Rock...

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,300
Paper...

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Rock!

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,120
If you wish to become stronger,

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,100
this is a perfect opportunity.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,230
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,580
Whether we win or lose,

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,950
hell lies ahead of us.

19
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,040
Kite x And x Slots

20
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,610
Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced

21
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,570
deep within NGL, in search
of the Chimera Ant nest,

22
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,620
and have arrived at a cliff
with peculiar openings.

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,330
This is the Chimera Ant nest?

24
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,630
No.

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,990
They don't make their nests in holes.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,820
They use mud and feces to build them.

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,940
Let's go.

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,920
You'll understand once we're inside.

29
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,120
There's no telling when or
from where they will attack.

30
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,240
Be on your guard.

31
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,950
Yeah, got it.

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,970
That other Chimera Ant

33
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,930
completely concealed his presence.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah.

35
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,240
Let's go.

36
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,260
Is this place...

37
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,030
Yes, it is NGL's hidden side.

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,200
A drug factory.

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,630
Exactly.

40
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,290
This factory produces the ingestible drug D²,

41
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,350
which is spreading throughout the mainland.

42
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,900
There are probably nearby bila trees,
which produce its main ingredient.

43
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,890
Ironic given their claims as preservationists.

44
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,280
They're making more than drugs.

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,700
Look.

46
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,420
It's the same as the others.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,100
I assume that only the NGL leaders
know the truth of this place.

48
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,430
The other members

49
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,930
joined because they honestly loved nature.

50
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,060
So this facility is the center
of NGL's underground.

51
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,940
If it's empty...

52
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,870
Then Chimera Ants have wiped
out the NGL underground.

53
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,950
And a bunch of amateurs with guns
won't suffice to deal with them.

54
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,020
What about their boss?

55
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,310
He either escaped or was eaten.

56
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,830
Either way, it's bad news.

57
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,920
Huh? What do you mean?

58
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,690
Shh!

59
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,590
A few are around.

60
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,910
They're slowly approaching
through the middle tunnel.

61
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,440
There are more in the left and right tunnels.

62
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,270
En...

63
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,730
How far away can you search?

64
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,370
Everything within a forty-five meter radius.

65
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,630
F-Forty-five meters?

66
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,740
Depending on physical and mental condition,
I can increase that by a few meters.

67
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,500
Here they come.

68
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,110
Keep it down, you two.

69
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,150
Who are you guys?

70
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,160
How dare you intrude on my turf?

71
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,500
Help... Please help us!

72
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,470
Stop talking, Spot!

73
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,580
You're just a damned dog!

74
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,120
Oops, didn't mean to do that.

75
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,490
Oh, well.

76
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm getting bored with these guys.

77
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,750
Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too.

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,720
When you beg like that,
I just want to kill you more.

79
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,190
Stop!

80
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,320
Kite...

81
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,820
Don't move carelessly.

82
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,400
There's more than one enemy.

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,330
They want you to rush over.

84
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,080
Bye-bye.

85
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,020
H-Hel—

86
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,350
Don't look away.

87
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,990
If they shoot a projectile your way,
you won't be able to see it.

88
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,670
I've got it.

89
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,540
You three will be my new dogs.

90
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,150
Chimera Ants have always been aggressive,

91
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,130
but it seems consuming malicious humans
has made them even more evil.

92
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,200
Huh? What do you mean?

93
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,760
Phagogenesis.

94
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,780
If we don't deal with them here,
many more will die!

95
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,560
Capture them!

96
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll take the one in back.

97
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,950
You boys will have to deal
with the two rushing us.

98
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,980
Right!

99
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,660
Got it.

100
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,360
Do not hesitate.

101
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,790
You must fight to kill.

102
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,780
Bring it!

103
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,230
Ha, take this.

104
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,900
My unblockable Thousand Punches!

105
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,500
That was close.

106
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,380
You have more power than I expected.

107
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,790
These guys are really tough.

108
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,890
They have the hard shells of insects,
combined with human agility...

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,890
What's on your mind now?

110
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,640
He's right.

111
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,140
I can't hesitate!

112
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,570
First comes rock...

113
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,430
What?

114
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,250
Little boy, do you want your new
name to be Spot or Rover?

115
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,750
Don't hesitate to kill.

116
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,810
You'll be roving around the land of the
dead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!

117
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,310
Been a while since I flipped my switch on.

118
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,970
Snake Awakens

119
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,230
Damn you!

120
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,820
Curse you!

121
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,210
Take this!

122
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,840
Fool!

123
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,120
This is the poisonous one!

124
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,780
Well?

125
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,440
How does it feel as the poison
spreads through your body?

126
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,780
Does it feel good?

127
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,960
Very effective.

128
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,510
Once I drug him enough,
we'll have a human dog.

129
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,020
Are you done over there?

130
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,720
Oh, not yet?

131
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,050
How...

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,980
My body is immune to poison.

133
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,890
Ah, I see.

134
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,370
If you behave, I'll kill you fast.

135
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,260
Oh, well...

136
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,090
It just means that I was weaker.

137
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,890
She let that cheap act fool her.

138
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,660
What is this power flowing from his body?

139
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,640
Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage.

140
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,530
But...

141
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,410
What's wrong?

142
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,030
Are you getting scared?

143
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,660
If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!

144
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,900
The source of his power

145
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,500
is his fist!

146
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,990
He's preparing to launch an attack many...

147
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,680
No, dozens of times stronger than the last.

148
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,170
Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?

149
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,760
No, he's definitely going to use his fist.

150
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,870
Then I have no choice.

151
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,510
I'll sacrifice my eight left
legs to block his punch,

152
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,270
while using the right eight to grab him.

153
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,650
Then I can bite him and inject my venom!

154
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,380
Let's run a simulation...

155
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
This will work!

156
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,990
It's just a punch.

157
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,330
No matter how strong it is,

158
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,010
if I'm prepared, I can take it!

159
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,250
Hey, we should get started soon.

160
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,770
Wait a little longer.

161
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,380
Screw that!

162
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,900
You don't have a choice in the matter.

163
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,400
Now, entertain me.

164
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,570
Very well...

165
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,660
What...

166
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,620
Why are you here?

167
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,440
This is my castle.

168
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,980
A king needs no reason to be in his castle.

169
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,650
There are many drugs here
that emit strong odors.

170
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,670
I would expect you to avoid this place.

171
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,370
Shut up... I like this place!

172
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,900
What happened to the head of NGL?

173
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,140
He would have been here.

174
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,340
Beats me!

175
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,340
He's probably inside the Queen's belly.

176
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,550
I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.

177
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,020
Then I'll take control of the whole world.

178
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,640
That will be impossible for a
boor who amuses himself

179
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,420
by making dogs of humans.

180
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,350
Really now?

181
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,800
I can't wait to strip you down and
put a collar around your neck!

182
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,020
Damn!

183
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,170
Huh?

184
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,180
Hey! Get down here!

185
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,510
You only summon me when you're in trouble.

186
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,970
You'd better watch it.

187
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,130
I don't have time for small talk.

188
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,380
Hurry it up.

189
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,890
Oh, really?

190
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,220
You're so impatient.

191
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,220
Are you insulting me?

192
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,300
Forget about turning you into a dog!

193
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,980
I'm gonna kill you!

194
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,440
4!

195
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,560
Four, huh?

196
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,850
Damn, bad spin.

197
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,070
What was that?

198
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,640
I have no bad spins, bastard!

199
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
Die!

200
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,280
I'll pretend to attack,

201
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,520
while I block his punch.

202
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,620
Then I grab him and bite.

203
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,190
Here I go!

204
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,230
Rock... Paper...

205
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,490
Just as I thought!

206
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,660
Block!

207
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,250
Scissors!

208
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,410
What?

209
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,420
A-A sword?

210
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,940
Impossible...

211
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,930
Where was he hiding that?

212
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,840
But this could be perfect.

213
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,870
I can pretend I've been defeated,

214
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,900
then wait for an opening to bite him!

215
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
You can't relax after dismembering them.

216
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,330
The head and body can survive

217
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,520
an entire day after they've been separated.

218
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,480
You must crush the head.

219
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,030
And preferably, you'll kill
them quickly and quietly.

220
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,270
Oh, it's him!

221
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,110
The thing that shot us.

222
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,180
I got a slot machine in my mouth!

223
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,230
It goes from 1 to 9.

224
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,350
Each number summons a different weapon.

225
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,220
This is my Crazy Slot!

226
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,390
Don't forget the name!

227
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,140
Just go away.

228
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,120
That's a strange power...

229
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,400
It talks by itself?

230
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,010
Apparently.

231
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,620
If it uses a slot machine,

232
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,270
doesn't that mean you can't
choose your weapon?

233
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,970
Yes, and I cannot

234
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,440
change or get rid of the
weapon I receive until I use it.

235
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,790
It's very aggravating.

236
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,890
In that case...

237
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,030
Why did you come up with this power?

238
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,040
We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.

239
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,040
Were they killed?

240
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,880
The signal indicated three enemies,

241
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,430
and that they looked tastier than the others.

242
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,160
They must be rare humans.

243
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,060
And we have cause to fight.

244
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,840
Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?

245
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,200
So the rare humans should
still be near the factory.

246
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,810
Let's go! Tonight, we feast!

247
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,640
Feast!

248
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,080
Both of your powers are much
easier to use than mine.

249
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,780
Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.

250
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,840
Yeah.

251
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,890
Gon, you appear to have incorporated
Enhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter

252
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,720
abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors.

253
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,730
Yep, but my natural affinity
lies with Enhancer abilities.

254
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,920
Killua used lightning.
Are you a Transmuter?

255
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,480
Yeah, but it's not that strong,
and I lose energy fast.

256
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,280
You'll have the chance to improve.

257
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,990
Let's hurry.

258
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,950
The nest is close.

259
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,540
I don't get it...

260
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,570
I can feel power rushing into me.

261
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,480
My body is overflowing with energy!

262
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,000
What is this?!

263
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,040
What's wrong?

264
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,480
A signal from one of my soldiers.

265
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,290
Rammot is acting strangely.

266
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,630
Rammot?

267
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,860
Well?

268
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,610
Look at this!

269
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,660
I feel reborn!

270
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,240
Can you see that light, Peggy?

271
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,070
What tremendous life energy...

272
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,110
A Chimera Ant has finally
discovered the power of Nen.

273
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,390
Next time: Inspiration x To x Evolve.

274
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,590
I want inspiration to evolve!

275
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,660
When will you evolve?

276
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,960
Now!
