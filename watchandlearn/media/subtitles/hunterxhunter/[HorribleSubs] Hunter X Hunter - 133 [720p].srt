00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,190
After challenging Meruem to a
contest in order to buy time,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,050
Pouf was now scattering scales on the
citizens who were not yet hypnotized.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,490
I must hurry or Meruem-sama
will remember that woman...

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,590
We haven't moved forward at all.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,000
What's going on up ahead?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,170
Shh, no talking!

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,990
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,430
The soldiers are held up in the back.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,480
I heard all their commanders have
collapsed, one after another...

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,780
Like puppets whose strings have been cut.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,070
There haven't been any warnings
about stepping out of line anymore.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,990
I keep hearing loud noises
coming from the palace...

14
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,020
Something is weird!

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,020
Maybe...

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,200
It's a coup d'état?

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,700
After giving the King 6/7 of my body,

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,120
I've lost a lot of my power.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,520
The scales aren't scattering well.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,720
And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,010
Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,140
Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,480
The boy didn't look to be that strong.

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,250
I cannot use my clones while
I'm scattering my scales.

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,500
But I need to hurry and kill the woman.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,130
Whatever it takes...

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,740
This is my final chance!

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Deadline x To x Live

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,020
Palm, take the four women still here with you.

30
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,230
They didn't run away?

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,320
No.

32
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,530
Use duct tape to bind their
hands and cover their eyes.

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,910
If they see me, it'll take too long to explain.

34
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,490
That's true... I understand.

35
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,590
Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?

36
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,130
A messenger?

37
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,650
You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard

38
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,600
that the woman is in the underground warehouse.

39
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,140
Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.

40
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,450
Once that's done, you're free.

41
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,140
It's probably a trap, right?

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,650
That's what I'll tell the King.

43
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,580
If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me.

44
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,900
Yeah.

45
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:25,260
Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the
enemy's bidding may anger the King.

46
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm not gonna dig my own grave.

47
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,920
Fine, I'll try it.

48
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,030
Can you drive?

49
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,550
Better than you.

50
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,430
It's important that he carries out his mission.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,350
Perhaps I should keep an eye on him,
even if it means losing Pouf...

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,120
Palm.

53
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,440
It's okay.

54
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,300
Welfin,

55
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,520
once this is over, you're free.

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
Go and see Gyro.

57
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,780
Don't get too cocky!

58
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,340
I'll kill you!

59
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,250
Don't you dare speak his name!

60
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,840
You would never understand!

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,090
I understand, Zaikahal.

62
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,780
How...

63
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,990
How do you know

64
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,640
my former...

65
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,350
I didn't tell anyone.

66
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,650
I probably won't ever remember my former name,

67
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,870
but we were buddies.

68
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,240
Buddies?

69
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,880
Before we were Ants.

70
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,830
They're our enemies.

71
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,560
Enemies of NGL.

72
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,540
Am I wrong?

73
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,990
Brovada has forgotten his past,

74
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,110
but he was also one of us.

75
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,320
Take him with you.

76
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,640
Ikalgo...

77
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,490
How do you know?

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,010
What do you mean?

79
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,410
You told me to go see Gyro.

80
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,020
You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.

81
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,350
Yeah, that's true.

82
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,020
But...

83
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,270
I don't know that he's alive.

84
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,520
I just can't believe otherwise.

85
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,030
Since we all "survived."

86
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,030
He couldn't have just been digested.

87
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,540
Damn it... Damn it!

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,810
Damn it!

89
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,960
Are you sure about this, Pouf?

90
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,140
Ten minutes have passed, and I don't
see any sign of Pitou returning...

91
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,090
Get out.

92
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,300
Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.

93
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,310
Once you're outside, you'll understand
the current situation.

94
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,760
I hate to admit it...

95
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,650
But Ikalgo's right.

96
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,360
Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.

97
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,020
Which means they're the enemy.

98
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,440
I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.

99
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll be his messenger!

100
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,290
Stop!

101
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,660
Youpi-dono?

102
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,520
I already found a Royal Guard.

103
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,950
Youpi-dono...

104
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,820
I have a message that must be
taken to the King immediately.

105
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,090
The underground warehouse?

106
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,960
Yes.

107
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,430
And they're looking to exchange

108
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,350
the woman for their allies that
have been taken hostage?

109
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,280
Yes.

110
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Please tell the King at once.

111
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,470
Got it... I'm on it.

112
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,470
Right...

113
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,870
We're having a contest, so I
don't need to tell the King.

114
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,040
If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one.

115
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,600
You can go.

116
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes, sir.

117
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,580
Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf.

118
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,010
Still, what's Pitou doing right now?

119
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,940
Chimera Ants are the enemy.

120
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,650
Gyro's enemy...

121
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,580
Our enemy!

122
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,670
Youpi-dono!

123
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,050
I have a question!

124
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,700
What is it?

125
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,740
Do you have any memories of your former life?

126
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,700
Memories from before you
became a Chimera Ant?

127
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,960
No, of course not.

128
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,210
I am the Royal Guard Youpi.

129
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,570
I've never been anyone else.

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,470
Don't ask me stupid questions!

131
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,300
Youpi-dono...

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,560
Hey! That's enough—

133
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,500
If you attack me, I'll fight back.

134
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,110
I have a few questions for you.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,560
You have five seconds to answer.

136
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,230
Don't get too cocky, you little punk!

137
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,570
Contest...

138
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,410
Contest...

139
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,600
Something is missing...

140
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,050
Marshal

141
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Marshal

142
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,060
Marshal

143
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,700
Yes...

144
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,990
I was

145
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,700
battling someone.

146
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,580
Someone

147
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,430
that I have yet to defeat

148
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,690
a single time...

149
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,760
That took much longer than expected.

150
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,760
By now, Pitou must have returned...

151
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,010
I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.

152
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,940
Where's Youpi?

153
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,560
Where has Youpi gone?

154
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,240
What's that?

155
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,840
Youpi?

156
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,540
I-It can't be...

157
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,200
We're okay now...

158
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,330
What do you mean, Palm?

159
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,530
King! Meruem-sama!

160
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,370
Youpi has been killed.

161
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,570
There are still skilled enemies around!

162
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,330
Where's Pitou?

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,330
Oh, Pitou hasn't returned...

164
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,040
Then...

165
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,740
I can now begin, yes?

166
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,460
W-Wait, Meruem-sama!

167
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,340
The situation has changed...

168
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,750
It's too dangerous! The contest is—

169
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,250
The contest is off?

170
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,650
That means I have won.

171
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,820
Tell me everything you know.

172
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,990
Is that acceptable?

173
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,110
We're okay now?

174
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,460
What do you mean, Palm?

175
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,320
Killua deduced that she is special to the King.

176
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,380
But the Royal Guard is divided...

177
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,900
That is because

178
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,880
Pitou tried to save and protect her,

179
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,150
while Pouf tried to kill her.

180
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,070
In other words,

181
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,560
she is a double-edged sword for the King.

182
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

183
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,550
I find that hard to believe.

184
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,160
It's impossible

185
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,570
for the Royal Guard to bicker
and defy the King's will!

186
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,140
Is it?

187
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,870
Then why are you and I here now?

188
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,080
Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants

189
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,750
to side with humans?

190
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,580
Adding humans to the gene pool

191
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,960
has led to many events that would be
impossible for normal Chimera Ants.

192
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,500
Can you be certain that I'm wrong?

193
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,650
Sorry...

194
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,020
My point is that

195
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,740
the division among the Royal Guard
may not necessarily contradict

196
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,610
their loyalty to the King.

197
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,880
There is a human that the
King cares deeply about.

198
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,010
"We must protect that human."

199
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,090
"We must kill that human."

200
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,620
Both reactions make sense.

201
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,380
For now, I'll concede that point to you.

202
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,560
Why does that mean we're okay now?

203
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,880
Twenty minutes have passed
since the initial wave of En.

204
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,180
But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.

205
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,810
I don't get it...

206
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,650
What's going on here?

207
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,800
When the En was used, I was carrying this girl.

208
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,420
If the King had noticed,

209
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,660
he would have come straight to me.

210
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,910
He didn't because I had
concealed her within my hair.

211
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,910
It's possible that he didn't realize
I was carrying another person.

212
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,130
Are you following me?

213
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,130
It seems logical, so I can't argue that...

214
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,680
But I still don't see your point.

215
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,060
If she's covered up, the King
can't find her with his En.

216
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,880
Are you suggesting

217
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,190
that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die,
rather than make an exchange?

218
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,770
Of course not...

219
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,330
We'll offer to make an exchange.

220
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,640
But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.

221
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,890
To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place

222
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,700
where the King cannot find her.

223
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,920
Buy time? How long are we talking?

224
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,730
Until the King dies.

225
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,990
What is she talking about?

226
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,940
Until the King dies?

227
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,120
Sure, he has to die sometime...

228
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,290
But if we knew when he'd die,
we wouldn't have a problem!

229
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,140
Why are we okay now?

230
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,090
Give me a proper explanation!

231
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,000
The King will die, and it will happen soon.

232
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,530
Within the next few hours,

233
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,350
the King will die!

234
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,280
We need to go deeper...

235
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,950
Yes, we must put her in a place
where only we can find her.

236
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,230
That should do it.

237
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,810
All that's left is to negotiate,

238
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,380
without going far enough to make the King snap.

239
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,790
I know...

240
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,250
What we're doing is cruel.

241
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,210
We are no different from them.

242
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,530
No...

243
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,330
We are far worse!

244
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,350
Pitou... Pitou...

245
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,310
Where are you?

246
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,940
Pitou!

247
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,680
Next time: The Word x Is x You.

248
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,030
And it isn't "Killua."

249
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,270
And that's all there is to it.
