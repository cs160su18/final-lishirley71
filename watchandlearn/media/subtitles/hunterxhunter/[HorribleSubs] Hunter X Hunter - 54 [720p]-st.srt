00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:15,030
Fortunes x Aren't x Right?

3
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,690
Ready, go!

4
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,670
Kurapika!

5
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,100
This is great.

6
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,940
Huh?

7
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,590
The spiders are dead,

8
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,930
so you can finally focus on your main goal.

9
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,680
You have to find the eyes of your people.

10
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,410
Gon...

11
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,090
Yep.

12
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,580
If there's anything we can do to help—

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,700
Hey!

14
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,930
You did it first.

15
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,940
I was getting revenge!

16
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,690
But I didn't do it on purpose.

17
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,950
You did it deliberately!

18
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,790
Why are you so upset?

19
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
We sold that piece for 355 million Jenny!

20
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,210
It could have sold for more...

21
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,630
We got a decent price!

22
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,850
No, we could have gotten over 400
million if we'd sold at a different time.

23
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,100
We had bad luck...

24
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,170
You sure take this seriously.

25
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,820
It isn't like you would've gotten anything
if we'd gotten a better price.

26
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,640
That's not the issue here.

27
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,610
If we run with the money,
we'd each get a 170 million cut!

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,620
Are you really friends with Gon and Killua?

29
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,260
I was joking.

30
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,860
Hello?

31
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,270
Oh, Kurapika!

32
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,800
It's been a while since we
were all together last!

33
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,700
Yeah.

34
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,440
Where's Zepile-san?

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,080
He wanted to validate our check

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,770
and find more hidden gems to sell.

37
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,340
Anyway...

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,780
What?

39
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,770
You've got this intensity about you...

40
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,400
You seem a little more intimidating now.

41
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,690
Really?

42
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,710
You don't seem to have changed much.

43
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,940
And you're more annoying, too!

44
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, I heard that you defeated
a member of the Troupe.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,130
Having only just learned Nen,
how did you manage that?

46
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,980
If you're looking for advice
on catching the spiders,

47
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,170
then stop.

48
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,360
That's not the only reason.

49
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,070
We want to master Nen.

50
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,590
Because we'll definitely
need Nen in the future.

51
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,390
Then you don't want my advice.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,280
It won't do you any good.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,190
Why not?

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,940
My power can only be
used against the Troupe.

55
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,750
Huh?

56
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,700
Restraint and vow?

57
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah.

58
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,710
Nen is strongly affected by your mental state.

59
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,630
The stronger your resolve,
the more power you receive.

60
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,710
However, you also incur a
big risk at the same time.

61
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,830
In return for Nen power,

62
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,870
I vowed to use it against the spiders alone.

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,970
I established a rule for myself.

64
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,900
What's the rule?

65
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,730
If I use my chains on one who isn't a spider,

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,480
I will forfeit my life.

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,920
Huh? What do you mean?

68
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,420
There is a Nen blade pointed at my heart.

69
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,440
If I break the rule,

70
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,120
that blade will pierce my heart, killing me.

71
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,890
This is the rule that shows my resolve.

72
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,870
Restraint and vow.

73
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,080
My power is the product of pure hatred.

74
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,010
It only works on the spiders.

75
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,010
I'm telling you because I trust you.

76
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,160
Don't tell anyone else.

77
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,840
Why...

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,770
Why would you tell us something so important?!

79
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm not sure.

80
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,780
With their leader's death,
I must have relaxed.

81
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,110
It'll be fine if we keep our mouths shut.

82
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,030
It's too dangerous.

83
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,780
One of the surviving members can read minds.

84
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,660
If they find out, Kurapika won't
be able to beat them!

85
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,490
But she didn't learn anything last time.

86
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,490
That's because we didn't know
Kurapika was the chain user.

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,750
Then we just have to stay away from them.

88
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,040
They've already checked you,
so they think you're clean.

89
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
But there's also a guy called Nobunaga.

90
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,540
He's especially dangerous.

91
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,100
He's looking for Kurapika,

92
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,470
and he's still trying to chase us down.

93
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,570
Is he aware that you guys know Kurapika?

94
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,190
No...

95
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,090
Then it's okay!

96
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,750
As long as no one around the mind reader

97
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,740
knows Kurapika, then you're safe.

98
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,330
Well, I've also been in
contact with Hisoka.

99
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,080
What?!

100
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,710
Hisoka?

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,090
He knows that I am the chain user.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,330
We made a pact,

103
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,470
but his target, the leader of
the spiders, is now dead.

104
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,390
So I don't know what he'll do.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,540
What do you mean?

106
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,610
We're leaving?

107
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,810
I mean exactly what I say.

108
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,860
We're departing tonight.

109
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,110
We'll take the rest of the treasure tonight.

110
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,370
That will be the end.

111
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,240
It isn't.

112
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,360
What else is there?

113
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,100
We have to find the chain user.

114
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,860
You seem obsessed.

115
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,500
Yes, I am.

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,510
We're going to scatter
without avenging Uvo?

117
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,730
Uvo will be bored in the next
world if we don't send

118
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,890
the chain user to join him.

119
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,990
Cut it out, Nobunaga.

120
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,530
The boss has issued an order.

121
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,140
Yeah, and an order from
the boss is absolute.

122
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,250
But is that really an order from our boss,

123
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,380
Chrollo?

124
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,180
Nobunaga, watch yourself...

125
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,220
Shut up!

126
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm talking to Chrollo!

127
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,290
Before I can answer your question...

128
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,040
Nobunaga,

129
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,530
I need you to answer my question.

130
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,140
Nobunaga,

131
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,390
I need you to answer my question.

132
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,020
What's your date of birth?

133
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,450
Huh?

134
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,020
What day were you born?

135
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,770
September 8th, 70.

136
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,530
Blood type?

137
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,470
B.

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,150
Name?

139
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,990
Nobunaga Hazama...

140
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,330
You already know that!

141
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,510
The hell is this about?!

142
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,290
What do you want next?

143
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,640
No, that's enough.

144
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,030
Write all of that on this sheet of paper.

145
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,290
Why didn't you tell me to
do that in the first place?

146
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,290
Huh? What's this?

147
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,760
A one hundred percent accurate
fortune written in verse.

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
The ability to see the future.

149
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,950
I stole this power from Nostrade's daughter.

150
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,950
One hundred percent accurate?

151
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,710
Each of the four verses predicts
what will happen in that week.

152
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,090
The calendar loses a precious component.

153
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,200
The remaining months gather to mourn.

154
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,980
The first moon, having missed his opportunity,

155
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,530
continues to pursue the eleventh moon alone.

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,910
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

157
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,170
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

158
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,550
But the spider does not stop.

159
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,440
Even after losing half its limbs.

160
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,270
This is the fortune his
daughter gave me yesterday.

161
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,080
Is the precious component of the calendar...

162
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,830
Uvo.

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,360
That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.

164
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,860
In other words, she predicted our attack

165
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,990
on the Mafia auction.

166
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,850
And there were fans of her
fortunetelling among the Ten Dons.

167
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,630
I get it.

168
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,980
That explains why the merchandise

169
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,630
had already been moved the
first time we attacked.

170
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,230
What does Nobunaga's fortune say?

171
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,370
The pen writes by itself.

172
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,080
I don't know what was written.

173
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,860
Ask Nobunaga.

174
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
Well, Nobunaga?

175
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,500
Next week, five of us will probably die.

176
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,230
Which five?

177
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,260
No idea...

178
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,130
I can't interpret this.

179
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,770
I kind of understand the second verse.

180
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,010
The spider loses half its limbs.

181
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,480
The spider would be us?

182
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,730
Yeah.

183
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,130
And the limbs would be the members,

184
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,020
so half would be six.

185
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,150
That means five more after losing Uvo.

186
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,600
The same line was in my fortune.

187
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,150
Let me see.

188
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,160
Boss, can you tell my fortune?

189
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,820
The calendar loses a precious component.

190
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,050
The remaining months gather to mourn.

191
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,690
You join your ally as an offering,

192
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,790
to keep him from being lonely.

193
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,370
You will find eternal rest

194
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,840
in a room filled with black merchandise.

195
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,800
Beware solitude above all.

196
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,850
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.

197
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,160
I thought so.

198
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,550
I'm going to die next week.

199
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,290
Seriously?

200
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,140
Yep.

201
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,210
Because I only got two verses.

202
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,870
And Pakunoda and Shalnark will die, as well.

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
How do you know that?

204
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
It seems the numbered months
here refer to Troupe members.

205
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,340
November is the eleventh month.

206
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,860
Uvo was member #11.

207
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,070
Exactly.

208
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,260
The chrysanthemum is the
flower of September.

209
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,010
It blooms in August, the eighth month,

210
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,420
and it withers in June.

211
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,890
This refers to members #6, #8, and #9.

212
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,270
And since the word "falling"
is used, it implies death.

213
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,900
I'm not certain to whom "Scarlet Eyes" refers.

214
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,480
It isn't one of us.

215
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,780
I'm guessing it's the chain user.

216
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,860
Scarlet Eyes...

217
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,340
I remember now.

218
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,460
The clan whose eyes turned red.

219
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,800
Then there was a survivor?

220
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,040
So it seems...

221
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,550
Will he also die?

222
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,070
Hard to say.

223
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,670
It could just mean that he's covered in blood.

224
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,420
Nobunaga, this means we'll
suffer serious casualties

225
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,380
if we fight the chain user!

226
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,560
We'll lose half our members.

227
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,020
You and I have abilities that
can be easily replaced,

228
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,060
but Shizuku and Pakunoda have rare powers.

229
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,690
The Troupe can't afford to lose them.

230
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,750
Today is Saturday of the first week.

231
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,370
If we return home today,

232
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,710
we won't run into the chain user next week.

233
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,460
The advantage of being able
to predict the future

234
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,710
is that we can avoid undesirable prophecies.

235
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,490
If we leave this place without
fighting the chain user,

236
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,940
this fortune is one hundred percent
certain to not come true.

237
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,030
Nobunaga, you and Uvo were
the Troupe's attackers.

238
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,970
To die is just part of your job.

239
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,490
I believe that you both chose
that role voluntarily.

240
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,370
Yeah, that's right...

241
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,130
Shizuku, Paku, and Shal collect intelligence.

242
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,300
They provide our support.

243
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,760
You could say they're our lifeline.

244
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Isn't it your job to serve as their shield?

245
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
Yeah, it is!

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,510
Wait...

247
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,470
You should tell some of the
other members' fortunes.

248
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,460
Perhaps we could gather additional
clues for avoiding the prophecy.

249
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,730
What do we do?

250
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,910
Now that we know Kurapika's secret,

251
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,110
it's dangerous to wait around.

252
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,250
If Nobunaga captures either Gon or me again,

253
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,370
we probably won't be able to escape.

254
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,350
But we have Kurapika with us now.

255
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,980
We should take them out

256
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,420
before they have a chance
to recover and escape.

257
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,050
We know where their current base is.

258
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,650
If we take too long, they might get away.

259
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,950
We need to move fast.

260
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,640
They could be making an
escape as we speak.

261
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,060
We don't have time for too much thought.

262
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,390
The woman you mentioned
is certainly a threat...

263
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,310
But since their leader is dead,

264
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,410
I'll do as Gon says, and focus on
recovering my brethren's eyes.

265
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,790
Seriously?!

266
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,740
Yeah.

267
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,430
You're sure about this?

268
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,000
Kurapika's made up his mind.

269
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,010
We can't force him to change it.

270
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,040
Sorry, Killua.

271
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,260
Thank you for the valuable information.

272
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,320
It's from Hisoka...

273
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,620
The dead bodies were fakes.

274
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,430
Kurapika?

275
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,180
The dead bodies were fakes...

276
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,970
Huh?

277
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,820
You mean the dead bodies
of the Troupe members?

278
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,920
Yeah, the dead spiders were fakes!

279
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,710
It would be possible for a
Conjurer to accomplish that.

280
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,250
Damn!

281
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,880
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

282
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,720
The situation's changed.

283
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,840
What now?

284
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,210
We're here to help.

285
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,470
Uh-huh.

286
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,720
Yeah.

287
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,010
Hello?

288
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,970
Kurapika, it's me.

289
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,560
Melody?

290
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,570
What is it?

291
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,430
The community has called off the hunt
for the remaining Troupe members.

292
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,460
What?

293
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,850
We've learned that they
came from Meteor City.

294
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,860
The Troupe comes from Meteor City?

295
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,020
The Ten Dons gave the order directly.

296
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,620
The reward has been rescinded.

297
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,630
The reward has been rescinded?

298
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,240
Seriously?

299
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,910
The Troupe comes from Meteor City.

300
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,140
Makes sense...

301
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,540
That explains why their
identities are still unknown,

302
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,390
and why the cops haven't
been able to catch them.

303
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,290
What's Meteor City?

304
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,370
A city populated by people who,
as far as society is concerned, don't exist.

305
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,150
There's a city like that?

306
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,420
Yeah.

307
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,350
Officially, it's unpopulated,

308
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,910
but it's said that ten million people live there.

309
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,560
It began as a dump over 1,500 years ago.

310
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,840
People began to live off the garbage

311
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,050
that was dumped there.

312
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,030
You're allowed to dump anything there.

313
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,480
From garbage to weapons, and even people.

314
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,140
And the residents

315
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,250
will accept anything left there.

316
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,370
I've heard that Meteor City
residents share a bond

317
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,770
thinner than that between strangers,
stronger than that between family.

318
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,520
Actually, there are those
who provide Meteor City

319
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,010
with weapons and precious metals
under the pretext of garbage.

320
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,290
That would be the Mafia community.

321
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,770
What do you mean?

322
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,910
But the Mafia is hunting the Troupe!

323
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,680
In return, the Mafia recruited
people from Meteor City.

324
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,710
People who didn't exist, as far
as society was concerned.

325
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,680
Perfect for committing crimes.

326
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,870
The Troupe destroyed the
normally intimate relationship

327
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,930
between the Mafia community and Meteor City.

328
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,520
But the Mafia has decided to
prioritize that relationship.

329
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,830
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,

330
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
half angel, half death-bringer.

331
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,520
You would do well to sell
the calendar's secrets.

332
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,310
He will be especially pleased to
learn the eleventh moon's secret.

333
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,580
The customer will return on a hot day,

334
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,530
leaving you alone with a man
bearing St. Peter's cross.

335
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,260
The false fourth moon will be
torn away from the calendar.

336
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,300
Only six pages remain.

337
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,820
What does your fortune say?

338
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,200
Let me see.

339
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,160
I don't recommend it.

340
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,710
It'll give you a shock.

341
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,580
Just let me see it.

342
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,040
Very well.

343
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,290
Look at this, everyone!

344
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,690
"A red-eyed customer will visit..."

345
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,570
"The calendar's secrets..."

346
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,980
That would be our secrets, right?

347
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,850
Hisoka, what is this?

348
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,340
Lemme see!

349
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,070
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,

350
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,970
seeking to make a trade.

351
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,870
The customer will use the
sword of law upon you,

352
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,370
taking the calendar's secrets with him.

353
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,270
The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,

354
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,870
losing five more legs.

355
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,430
Do not leave your temporary shelter,

356
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,340
for you are one of the remaining legs.

357
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,340
Hisoka...

358
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,100
Did you sell him out?

359
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,100
Sell out Uvo?!

360
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,760
Hisoka's fortune changed when
it was passed to Pakunoda.

361
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,120
What could that mean?
