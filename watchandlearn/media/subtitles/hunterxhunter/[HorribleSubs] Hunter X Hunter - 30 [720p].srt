2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:11,490
Shroud

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,980
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,500
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,810
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,770
Sorry, Wing-san.

23
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,480
But I'm itching to fight right now!

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,490
Fierce x And x Ferocious

25
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,480
Gon is in his first 200s match,

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,160
but he's been caught off guard
by the unexpected nature

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,820
of his opponent's attack.

28
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,670
He's been hit from behind by another top!

29
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,930
Gon is in big trouble,

30
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,650
after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!

31
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,620
Clean hit and knockdown!

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,850
Two points!

33
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,580
Gido has already earned four points!

34
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,450
Can you continue?

35
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,220
You bet!

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,340
There are too many tops for me to track.

37
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,220
Damn...

38
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,220
What should I do?

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,310
M-Master...

40
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
Is he using Nen?

41
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,450
Yes, that is a form of Hatsu.

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,730
He's projecting his aura into the tops.

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,160
That allows the tops

44
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,160
to move with more strength and
speed than normally possible.

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,930
Manipulating a small object requires
only a small amount of aura.

46
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,250
A large object requires a
larger amount of aura.

47
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,000
Gido is also using Nen in other ways here.

48
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,690
Those tops couldn't be so strong

49
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,010
were he simply using his aura to spin them.

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,530
It can only be accomplished

51
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,680
because he cares deeply about his tops.

52
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,190
Objects respond well

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,980
to those who are compatible.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,360
I can't follow them with my eyes.

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,200
Nen is powering the tops!

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,860
I can sense it.

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,450
Yeah, I can sense them.

58
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,040
My Ten is fading!

59
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,270
Another direct hit!

60
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,300
Gon is completely helpless!

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,770
He's been knocked out of the ring!

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
The score is now 6-0!

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,610
He's dug himself a big hole!

64
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,520
It won't work...

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,830
If I focus on sensing the tops,

66
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,800
my Ten shroud will dissolve.

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,010
What should I do?

68
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,150
A top was knocked outside the ring?

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,290
But it isn't attacking me...

70
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,800
What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?

71
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,030
Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.

72
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,820
If you're not in the ring within a ten-count,
I'll rule you the loser!

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,540
One!

74
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,940
Now that I think about it,

75
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,460
the Nen in this top didn't feel hostile.

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,430
What about the others?

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,260
They're spinning around,
bumping into each other.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,560
Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?

79
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,790
Four!

80
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,950
Why are you standing outside the ring?

81
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,810
If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!

82
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,540
Five!

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,740
Just as I thought...

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,820
This is like a game of sumo tops!

85
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,430
It's impossible to command tops
to move with precision.

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,700
It's likely Gido simply commands the tops

87
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,700
to strike anything in their way.

88
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,140
They spin around, striking whatever

89
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,960
happens to cross their paths.

90
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,240
Seven!

91
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,590
In that case, I don't need to fear the tops.

92
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,140
I can ignore the tops, and attack him!

93
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,360
Heh, you may have figured out my tops,

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,810
but you still can't land an attack!

95
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,960
There it is!

96
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,980
Gido's special technique,
combining offense and defense!

97
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,690
Tornado Top!

98
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,030
Tornado Top

99
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,860
He lands a strong counter on Gon!

100
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,370
Three points!

101
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,030
The judge has awarded a
critical hit and knockdown!

102
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,500
Gido has nine points!

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,100
Gon is on the verge of losing!

104
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,960
I turn myself into a top to protect myself,

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,760
while using my Dancing Tops to attack.

106
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,660
My strategy might be boring,

107
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,350
but it's effective for racking up points.

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,820
There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.

109
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,160
You can attack him until

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,860
he tires, and his Ten begins to fade.

111
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,230
You can use Hatsu that overpowers his defense.

112
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,740
Both methods require a large amount of aura.

113
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,640
However, Gon-kun doesn't know Ren,

114
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,370
the technique to instantly generate aura.

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,870
Learning how to quickly
create large amounts of aura,

116
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,030
and how to channel it into attacks,

117
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,380
requires endless training and
combat experience to learn.

118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,380
He'd need five more years
before he could fight Gido.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,330
I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.

120
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,750
What should I do?

121
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,760
What will it take to prolong this match?

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,500
If he scores one more point, it's over.

123
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,300
But I want to keep fighting.

124
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,910
What can I do right now?

125
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,660
That would be...

126
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,660
Gon!

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,420
He released his Ten?

128
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,320
That's reckless!

129
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,070
But he didn't simply release it.

130
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,180
That's...

131
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
Zetsu...

132
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,280
The technique for concealing your presence!

133
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,020
Your aura also disappears because
your micropyles are sealed.

134
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,910
Any aura that normally escapes
your body is also nullified,

135
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,570
so he has no Nen protection!

136
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,440
I didn't teach him Zetsu use!

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,030
Did he learn it on his own, before we met?

138
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,280
In that case, he wouldn't realize
that this is Zetsu.

139
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,770
He must have learned it while

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,770
attempting to track a beast or other target...

141
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,520
The boy certainly has incredible potential.

142
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,030
But why would he use it now,
in this situation?

143
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,380
Idiot!

144
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,730
If you're hit by a Nen attack, without protection,
you'll be totally messed up!

145
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,580
I know that.

146
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,200
But in order to track the tops' complex
pathing with only sensations to go on,

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,810
I must focus all my senses...

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Could it be that

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,710
he never expected to win?

150
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,490
He's risking his life...

151
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,060
Risking his life to train?

152
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,340
You don't want to live, kid?

153
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,840
Then I'll help you die!

154
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,260
What?!

155
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,020
Amazing!

156
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,020
It's the first time Gon has managed
to evade an attack!

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,790
I can feel them...

158
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,020
I know where they're heading!

159
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,920
This is all I can do right now...

160
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,810
Concentrate on dodging
my opponent's attacks!

161
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,410
I can still fight!

162
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,580
Your right radius and ulna were both broken.

163
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,150
Fractured humerus.

164
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,200
Three broken ribs.

165
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,410
Twelve other minor fractures.

166
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,150
Four months before you're
completely healed up.

167
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,420
You moron!

168
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,700
Sorry.

169
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,770
An apology won't help!

170
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,810
Do you have any brains in there?

171
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,100
Didn't you see what happened
to those who'd suffered

172
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,930
the traditional Nen greeting?

173
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,810
One wrong move, and you could
have ended up like them!

174
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,180
You're lucky not to be

175
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,720
hurt any worse.

176
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,770
Man, why do you think
Four-Eyes was training us?

177
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,190
Still...

178
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
I had a feeling I'd be okay.

179
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,390
I took a few hits,

180
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,990
but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long
as he missed my vital spots...

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
Come in.

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,350
Four-Eyes!

183
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,680
Uh, sorry...

184
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,440
An apology won't help!

185
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,440
What were you thinking?!

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,060
Didn't you see those who'd suffered
the traditional Nen greeting?

187
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,830
You could have ended up just like them!

188
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,750
Oh, that's what I just told him.

189
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,370
Honestly...

190
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.

191
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,340
Wing-san, I really am sorry.

192
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
No, I won't let this one slide.

193
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,990
Killua-kun,

194
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,070
do you know when Gon-kun will
have recovered completely?

195
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,020
The doctor said it would take two months.

196
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,020
I understand.

197
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,810
Thank you, Killua.

198
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,730
In that case,

199
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,890
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!

200
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,240
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, Nen.

201
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,400
If you don't abide by these rules,

202
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,270
I will never teach you again.

203
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,240
Well?

204
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,440
I understand. I'll do as you say.

205
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,740
Give me your left hand.

206
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,840
This is a promise thread.

207
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,790
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.

208
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,640
Killua-kun, a moment, please.

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,270
Killua-kun,

210
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,020
what is the true objective
you two are pursuing?

211
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,650
Well, we don't really have an objective.

212
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,900
Before running into Zushi and you,

213
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,160
my plan was to earn some quick cash.

214
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,590
Gon's here to train hard,
so he can defeat a guy named Hisoka.

215
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,830
That's it, really.

216
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,170
Looks like the others in the 200s
want to reach the top floor.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,190
Battle Olympia, was it?

218
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,930
I'm not too interested.

219
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
Oh, Gon is...

220
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,140
Well, I'm not sure...

221
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,430
He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.

222
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,630
But after seeing his match yesterday,

223
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,940
I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...

224
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,970
How long will this exchange continue?

225
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,470
There are nearly fifty tops flying
around the ring!

226
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,120
Gon is evading the frightening
whirlwind of tops!

227
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,270
Gido has used up all of his tops,

228
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,680
and can only watch with the rest of us!

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,390
Not that way!

230
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,650
There's nowhere to run...

231
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,030
You say that he was enjoying a situation

232
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,400
that could have cost him his life?

233
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,890
Yeah.

234
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,480
I know because I've felt the same way.

235
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,540
Although I take circumstances
into consideration, too.

236
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,260
Once he's in the zone,

237
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,210
he loses sight of everything else.

238
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,960
Oh!

239
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,800
But he isn't the type to break a
promise twice, so you needn't worry.

240
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,870
Perhaps I have...

241
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,810
It's too late.

242
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,560
Because Gon and I already know.

243
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,870
If you regret teaching us
and decide to back out,

244
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,520
we'll find someone else,
or we'll learn it ourselves.

245
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,080
You don't have to feel responsible.

246
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,280
My brother and Hisoka can both use Nen,

247
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,520
so Gon and I were bound to
discover it eventually.

248
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,720
I understand.

249
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,840
And I mean to finish what I started.

250
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,340
There are many things I must tell you.

251
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,090
Zushi is waiting in my lodge.

252
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,490
You can train with him.

253
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,370
No, I'll pass.

254
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,360
Huh?

255
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,110
I won't leave Gon behind.

256
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,130
If he keeps his promise,
I'll start training when he does.

257
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,860
Tell Gon-kun this...

258
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,620
I will allow him to practice the other "Nen"!

259
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,900
Tell him to practice "Ten" daily!

260
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,530
Hey, Gon.

261
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,200
Master...

262
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,780
I may have

263
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,730
awakened an incredible beast...

264
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,250
Master?

265
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,650
What do you mean?

266
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,390
You found the agency on your own,

267
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,440
so you must be sharp.

268
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,440
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.

269
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
I have no problem with your lack of experience.

270
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,320
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.

271
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,490
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.

272
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,930
What do you mean?

273
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,720
I said that I have a Hunter License!

274
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,420
But your exam hasn't ended yet.

275
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,210
I can tell.

276
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,420
What?

277
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,270
Can you see anything?

278
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,220
Eh?

279
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,710
Next to me.

280
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,480
You can't see a thing, right?

281
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,480
Once you've learned to see,

282
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,280
return.

283
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,540
That's the bare minimum.

284
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,980
What does she mean?

285
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,030
What is it that I cannot see?

286
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,800
You can't see it, but you can sense it.

287
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,520
Why did you do that?!

288
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,780
This?

289
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,350
Well, I was just playing with you.

290
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,230
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.

291
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,570
Consider this advice from a veteran...

292
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,780
You didn't notice when I stole this,

293
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,080
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.

294
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,830
Bastard... Return my Hunter License!

295
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,130
Can a newbie who knows nothing

296
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,340
of Nen defeat me?

297
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,770
Nen?

298
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,190
Wanna give it a try?

299
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,100
Understand now?

300
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,610
You still lack something.

301
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,620
I...

302
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,830
I need...

303
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,710
Enough power to fight on my own!

304
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,990
Come with me.

305
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,210
I'll be your teacher.

306
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,140
The real exam has only just begun.

307
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,850
Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.

308
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,160
And Kurapika has also encountered

309
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,780
a new power that will help propel him forward.

310
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

311
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

312
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

313
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

314
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

315
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

316
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

317
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,240
and Killua's

318
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

319
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:19,750
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

320
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,960
Today, we introduce the Hunter Agency!

321
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,160
A place that helps Hunters
find work.

322
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,500
This place helps pro Hunters find work.

323
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,540
The receptionist must be a
Nen practitioner,

324
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,130
It was hard to find the office Kurapika visited.

325
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,750
who turns away those
who can't use Nen.

326
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,700
You must be able to find the agency

327
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,960
before you qualify as a pro Hunter.

328
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,890
Next time: Destiny x And x Tenacity!

329
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,110
So who is Four-Eyes, anyway?

330
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,050
Hmm, I wonder who the Floor Masters are.

331
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,620
C-Could it be?
