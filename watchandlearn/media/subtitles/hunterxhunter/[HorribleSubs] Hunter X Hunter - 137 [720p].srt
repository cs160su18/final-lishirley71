00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,220
Chairman Netero gathered the top
leaders of the Hunter Association,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,470
the Zodiacs, for the purpose of
electing the next chairman.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,850
The Zodiacs...

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,730
Twelve Hunters whose abilities
the chairman had recognized.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,750
In emergencies, he entrusted
them with leading the Association.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,250
When nothing was happening, they
accompanied him in leisure activities.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,500
Each Zodiac is assigned a code name...

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,650
And most members, out of
adoration for the chairman,

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,270
made moving efforts to embody their code names,

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,510
such as changing their names or personas.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,010
However, there are exceptions.

13
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,020
Debate X Among X Zodiacs

14
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,020
Chairman!

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,470
Mizaistom (Ox)

16
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,490
I thought we had all the Zodiacs present,

17
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,270
but the Rat is missing.

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,730
Piyon (Rabbit)

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,420
The Vice Chairman is very busy,

20
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,150
even at a time like this.

21
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,690
Geru (Snake)

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,410
It's because it is a time like this.

23
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,290
He's scrambling to secure votes for himself, I'm sure.

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,640
Ginta (Sheep)

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,830
Chairman!

26
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,250
Ginta... You're loud, annoying, and you smell!

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,250
Cluck (Chicken)

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,740
Saiyu (Monkey)

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,660
Even the habitual slacker Ging showed up!

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,760
Guess the Rat's just a scumbag.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,210
Ging (Boar)

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,900
What do you mean, "even" I showed up?

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
I'll kill you, monkey.

34
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,640
Go ahead and try it, dumbass.

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,130
Botobai (Dragon)

36
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,830
I can't accept this.

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,020
Why didn't the chairman call us to help?

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,470
Kanzai (Tiger)

39
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,840
Agreed.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,170
Morel and Knov were above that kind of job!

41
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,520
"Above" is not the word you're looking for.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,100
Cheadle (Dog)

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,150
You wanted to hunt the Ants yourself, did you not?

44
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,520
The chairman wanted all of us together for this.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,150
Saccho (Horse)

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,530
Let's wait for him to arrive.

47
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,430
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,030
Pariston (Rat)

49
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,040
My apologies!

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,600
Everyone is in a frenzy over what's
going on with East Gorteau.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,180
It's a big problem.

52
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,760
Just sit down.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,250
Oh, sorry about that.

54
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,860
Then let's begin this meeting on the
election of the next chairman.

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,270
Hold on!

56
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,690
Why are you leading the meeting?

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Huh? Is there a problem?

58
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,440
Don't boss us around after you showed up late.

59
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,760
Pariston, you're irritating!
You're a creep! Get lost!

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,670
Well, I wasn't sure if I should take the lead.

61
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,330
But you know, I'm the Vice Chairman.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,930
I outrank the rest of you, and I'm
good at coordinating these things.

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,650
I'm sure you all want to finish this quickly.

64
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,960
That's why.

65
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,960
If we rank by age, Botobai-san should lead.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,470
Judging by ability to foster progress,
Cheadle-san should lead.

67
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,820
Both are better suited to the task than I.

68
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,470
Would one of you be willing to take over?

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,980
I'll refrain. You'd probably give me a hard time.

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,980
I concur.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,670
Forget it. Just lead the meeting.

72
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,240
Just come out and say you
want to do it, scumbag.

73
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,170
In that case, if anyone objects
to me leading this meeting,

74
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,910
raise your hand.

75
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,600
I object! I object! I seriously object!

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,640
I see four objections...

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,950
The majority says I should continue.

78
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,870
Of course, we can discuss any
complaints as they arise.

79
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm ready to step down anytime.

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,020
Then, I have a proposal.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,890
I will run for the position of chairman,

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,270
so let's not bother with an election.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,620
I'm gonna kill you, brat!

84
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,210
Scary... Everyone calm down.

85
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,530
My point is that we'll waste time and money.

86
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,540
We already know the results.

87
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,960
No one here will vote for you.

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,290
That's eleven votes.

89
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,340
Together, you can only muster eleven votes.

90
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,800
Do you know how many Hunters
are in the Association?

91
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,440
The late Chairman Netero was too strong...

92
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,930
So he couldn't understand
the feelings of the weak.

93
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,430
The same can be said for all of you.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,060
However, I can understand the weak!

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,320
That is the kind of Chairman I seek to be!

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,130
The weak end up becoming slaves
and working as intermediaries.

97
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,330
How much have you made off
them, Prince of Kickbacks?

98
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,740
Please, you have it wrong. I'm asking
them to contribute to the pool.

99
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,330
It's meant to help the Association expand.

100
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,530
Eighteen people.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,640
Do you know what that number represents?

102
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,010
The number of Hunters who've
gone missing in the three years

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,630
since you became Vice Chairman.

104
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,450
As professionals who risk our lives,

105
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,270
we're obligated to be aware of the
situations our trusted associates are in.

106
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,480
A missing Hunter is more bizarre than
a Hunter's unexpected death.

107
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,120
Before you became Vice Chairman, the
average was 0.6 Hunters missing per year.

108
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,240
It's increased tenfold.

109
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,750
Do you have anything to say?

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,250
That number is tragic... It pains me greatly.

111
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,310
Once I become Chairman,
the number will surely decrease!

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,430
I'll run for Chairman.

113
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,530
I'm going to carry on the old man's will.

114
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,190
Don't want to vote for either of them!

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,820
Ging-san, I hear something
happened to your son...

116
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,920
Sounds like it.

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,890
Should I visit him?

118
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,210
Sure, he'd probably be thrilled.

119
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,580
Would he even realize I was there?

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,230
I heard he's in critical condition.

121
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,320
Maybe I shouldn't go after all...

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,810
If he dies after I do, I'll have wasted my time.

123
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,080
Go visit him.

124
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,340
He isn't going to die.

125
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,570
Uh, can I ask a question?

126
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,980
First, shouldn't we reevaluate
the process for running?

127
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,480
You're the one who started it!

128
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,490
What's wrong with your head?!

129
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,280
I only offered to serve in hopes
of saving us money and time.

130
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,620
If we can't avoid the process,
let's first decide how to go about it.

131
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,370
There we go!

132
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,380
When he controls the pace,

133
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,250
everything becomes more complicated.

134
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,510
In that case, we can draw lots.

135
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,960
Screw that!

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,260
How can we have our leader chosen by chance?

137
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,510
Are you a scumbag, too?

138
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,520
I'll give a sheet of paper to each of you.

139
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,140
Hey...

140
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:28,060
I want each of you to write what you believe to be the optimal election process,

141
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,650
with the prerequisite of achieving
at least 95% voter turnout.

142
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,410
And a third party will pick one
of the proposals at random.

143
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,420
A third party?

144
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,910
I'm guessing she means Beans.

145
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,330
Each proposal has a 1 in 12 chance.

146
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,040
So there won't be any hard feelings.

147
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,210
That's true...

148
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,830
Not a bad idea.

149
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,170
That's fine, since I won't lose.

150
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,310
But we should write down our names,
so we know whose idea is chosen.

151
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,480
She said the odds are 1 in 12, but that isn't true.

152
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,980
If the ten of us write something
that puts Pariston...

153
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,510
and Ging, if possible...

154
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,490
at a disadvantage, our odds will be 5 in 6.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
If we record how each person votes,

156
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,870
Pariston will have an advantage.

157
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,480
Should we use anonymous ballots to allow
for dividing points among candidates?

158
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,590
Would our intermediaries then
betray us with no guilt or fear?

159
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,300
So here we are, Beans-san.

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,650
There are twelve sheets of paper inside.

161
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,660
Please pick one.

162
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,310
It will determine the rules
we will use for the election.

163
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,210
You want me to pick one?

164
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,670
This is an important task.

165
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,260
Then I will draw one.

166
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,090
The chosen proposal is Ging-san's.

167
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,730
Ging's rules...

168
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,990
He's no Pariston, but he's still trouble.

169
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,890
Rule #1.

170
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,500
"All Hunters are both candidates and voters."

171
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,050
Rule #2.

172
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,010
"If the winner of the first election fails
to receive a majority of votes,

173
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,120
the top sixteen will have a runoff.

174
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,090
If a majority is still not achieved, there will
be another runoff with half the candidates."

175
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,580
Rule #3.

176
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,520
"If the turnout for any given vote is under
95%, that vote must be redone."

177
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,180
Rule #4.

178
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,780
"Voters must write their name on the ballot.
Anonymous votes will be invalid."

179
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,450
What are you thinking?!

180
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,910
Why force people to sign them?

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,100
Are you an idiot? A total idiot?!

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,640
You are the idiots.

183
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,690
When everyone knows who voted for whom,

184
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,670
it's a lot more entertaining.

185
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,440
There's his problem...

186
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,560
He only cares about having fun!

187
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,370
Rule #5.

188
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,550
There's more?!

189
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,440
"The election committee chairman
will be Ging Freecss."

190
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,600
I didn't think of that!

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,730
I didn't include such a rule...

192
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,650
That was a mistake.

193
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,900
I was too focused on the actual rules.

194
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,100
This is what Ging really wanted.

195
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,930
Now he can control the election as he pleases.

196
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,270
May I say something?

197
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,480
This drawing was to determine how the
election would be conducted, correct?

198
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,070
Rules one through four are fine,

199
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,680
but the chairman should be chosen separately.

200
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,460
I can live with that.

201
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,430
You can?

202
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,600
This is a Hunter.

203
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,640
Frightening...

204
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,320
Two Days Ago

205
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,110
Ging-san!

206
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,330
Yo.

207
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,140
What brings you here so early?

208
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm surprised you actually came.

209
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,330
Yeah, I happened to be in the area.

210
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,700
That can't be true...

211
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,280
Thank you very much.

212
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,490
I saw the old man's video.

213
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,220
Oh, that pen and notepad...

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,260
Huh?

215
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,510
Can you leave one by the phone
in the conference room?

216
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,610
Oh, there should already be one.

217
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,890
Oh, never mind, then.

218
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,660
Is there also a trashcan like this one?

219
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,490
Yes.

220
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,290
Why do you ask?

221
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,870
Four...

222
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,120
No, eight.

223
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,260
Read this.

224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,110
These are rules for the election, yes?

225
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,450
Yeah.

226
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,590
What is this for?

227
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,980
In a few days, the Zodiacs will gather here.

228
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,570
Most likely, there will be a drawing.

229
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,190
Why would you say that?

230
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,560
If we tried to hold a vote or come to a
consensus, it would take too long.

231
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,270
Plus, Pariston will be there...

232
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,430
As far as he's concerned,

233
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,510
1 in 12 odds would be acceptable,
as long as it might give him an advantage.

234
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,280
Either way, it's a win for him.

235
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,300
And everyone else will think
their odds are 5 in 6...

236
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,530
That basically guarantees a drawing.

237
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,920
I expect Cheadle will propose it.

238
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,450
Saccho may protest.

239
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,140
Piyon would be a long shot.

240
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,560
Kanzai would be a really long shot...

241
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,810
And they'll ask me to hold the drawing?

242
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,290
There's no one else.

243
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,360
Everyone else in this building supports Pariston.

244
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,410
If these rules look acceptable, fold it three
times, and keep it until the meeting.

245
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,180
If they don't ask for you or if
I fold my paper differently,

246
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,230
I'll look at the floor, and you should
burn that piece of paper.

247
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,210
In my opinion, if you're willing
to become Chairman...

248
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,910
No, that won't happen.

249
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,360
Zero chance.

250
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,380
Sorry.

251
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm not doing this because I
want to change the result.

252
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,770
All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.

253
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,350
I'm not looking for any trouble.

254
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,860
But what about Rule #5?

255
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,380
That's a decoy.

256
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,480
If I leave that as Rule #5, it'll give people pause.

257
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,680
And if I agree to concede that rule,

258
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,110
they'll be more ready to accept the rest.

259
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,170
This is how criminals con people.

260
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,620
It's nothing special.

261
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,150
If Rule #5 passes, I'll resign.

262
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,500
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want

263
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,320
to change the result?

264
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,000
That's a strange question to ask.

265
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,590
If I can get my target to move as I want,

266
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,630
I've succeeded as a Hunter.

267
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,050
I just want to enjoy the process.

268
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,420
That's all.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,150
The election committee was composed
of the twelve Zodiacs.

270
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:16,660
Cluck, one of the Zodiacs,
sent ballots to every Hunter.

271
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,250
The election for the 13th Chairman...

272
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,610
The Hunter Association has 661 members.

273
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,930
Which means that is the number of candidates.

274
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,420
Each Hunter must bring their own ballot.

275
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,350
Ballots may only be entered when at least three

276
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,650
committee members are present,
and identification has been verified.

277
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,820
The voting takes place in the Hunter
Association headquarters.

278
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,240
As long as three or more
committee members are present,

279
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,210
absentee ballots may be entered
at a different location.

280
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,610
The vote will take place

281
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:07,010
from 12:00 AM on August 8th
to 11:59:59 PM on August 8th.

282
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,470
This will not change.

283
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,640
Any voting that occurs away from headquarters
must follow this schedule.

284
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,300
Votes will be tallied the same day.

285
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,970
And it is now August 8th, 12:00 AM.

286
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,880
The vote begins.

287
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,490
May I put it in?

288
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,750
This is a surprise.

289
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,110
I wouldn't think

290
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,310
a murderer would be interested
in such an ordinary event.

291
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,140
Eighty-five points.

292
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes, I'm not interested.

293
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,770
See? It's blank.

294
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,900
Then why are you here?

295
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,280
Ninety points...

296
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,520
Is someone named Ging here?

297
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,930
I'd like to speak to him.

298
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,530
He's already gone...

299
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,260
He said the next time we see
him here will be at the runoff.

300
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,510
Why don't you take your paper and leave?

301
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,170
Seventy-seven points.

302
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,710
Okay.

303
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,940
Heart is Valuable

304
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,280
You're bothering us!

305
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,330
Get lost! Aren't you done here?

306
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,700
He's here to assess the goods.

307
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,850
Ten points, twenty points, forty-five points.

308
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,210
Ten points, two points, fifty points, thirty points.

309
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,920
I guess pro Hunters are still nothing special...

310
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,970
If I want someone to fight,
it'll have to be a Zodiac.

311
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,250
Ninety-five points!

312
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,000
Ah, I have the results for the
13th chairman's election.

313
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,210
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 249 (37.6%)
2) Cheadle — 42
3) Ickshonpe — 26
4) Botobai, Mizaistom — 17
6) Saccho — 14
7) Ginta — 13
8) Morel — 12
9) Piyon, Cluck — 11
11) Cutie, Sanbica — 10
13) Teradein — 9

314
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:57,550
Valid votes, 580. Invalid votes, 48.
And absentees, 33.

315
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,760
14) Bushidora — 8
15) Ging — 7
6) Linne, Tsezguerra, Biscuit — 6
19) Knov, Loupe — 5
21) Kite, Geru, Kanzai, 2 others — 4
26) Satotz, Menchi, 7 others — 3
35) Hisoka, Saiyu, 9 others — 2
46) Gon, Hanzo, 25 others — 1

316
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,860
None of the candidates received a majority.

317
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,710
The turnout was 87.7%.

318
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,890
As the conditions were not met,
the vote must be redone.

319
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,410
Hey!

320
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,580
Can't I take a look?

321
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,460
No.

322
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,150
I'm just curious!

323
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,550
I won't allow anyone to view the ballots.

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,130
Since I was designated election chairman,

325
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,660
this is my decision to make.

326
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,320
It's no fun if I can't see who voted for whom!

327
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,910
Scrooge! Baldy!

328
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,910
Moron.

329
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,410
Are you bored?

330
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,170
And yourself?

331
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,460
So, Hisoka...

332
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,920
You probably don't watch the news.

333
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,680
The election was held because
Chairman Netero died.

334
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,210
Rumors say he died alongside
the mutant Ant he was fighting,

335
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,820
and the Association received
a lot of land in reward.

336
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,870
Ants?

337
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,280
As I thought.

338
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,690
A lot's happened around the world,

339
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,700
while you were chasing Chrollo.

340
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,620
If you'd stopped to think for a moment,

341
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,030
you could have fought the
chairman or the Ants.

342
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,460
That would require stopping to think...

343
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,590
Maybe you can become my manager?

344
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,340
Gon and Killua also joined the Ant hunt.

345
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,840
Gon's on the verge of death, and Killua's
gone to speak to our father.

346
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,950
What did you say?

347
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,100
At this rate, they both will die.

348
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,780
Both of them?

349
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,870
I can't have that happen.

350
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Illumi, explain clearly.

351
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,700
There is actually another
younger Zoldyck brother...

352
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,770
I want to get rid of him.

353
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,410
Illumi, Milluki, Killua, Kalluto...

354
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,410
Who is the fifth brother they share?

355
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,040
Next time: Plea x And x Favor.
