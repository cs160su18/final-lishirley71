2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,020
Midnight

3
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,980
Monster x And x Monster

4
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,820
The moment Killua entered the palace...

5
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,020
I knew it!

6
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,490
...was his reaction.

7
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,700
He couldn't sense Pitou's En at all,

8
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,010
and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had
expected to encounter on the first floor.

9
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,070
Despite the fact that they were now

10
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,390
in a situation that was utterly
unforeseen in their planning,

11
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,020
Killua's experience helped him stay calm.

12
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,860
Who are these guys?

13
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,530
Where did they come from?

14
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,530
From Youpi's perspective, too,
his current situation was an impossibility.

15
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,720
Youpi immediately ceased all thought.

16
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,680
I am a shield.

17
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,200
I protect the King with my body.

18
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,140
Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was
created from Magical Beasts, not humans.

19
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,450
Perhaps that was why

20
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,010
he lacked the self-preservative
nature of the other two Royal Guard.

21
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,710
However, that lack also gave him strength.

22
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,160
The moment Youpi changed
forms with a belligerent smile,

23
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,180
Shoot froze at once.

24
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,980
However, it wasn't because
Shoot was slow to react.

25
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,990
If I move any closer, he will attack.

26
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,740
And if his attack happens to connect with
the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...

27
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,500
In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,

28
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,270
he began to move his cage and floating arms...

29
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,620
And then it happened.

30
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,870
This is Dragon Dive!

31
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,320
Then the old man's friend is...

32
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,680
Only Killua understood what was happening,

33
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,590
and it momentarily froze him.

34
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,390
The shock was even greater to those
who didn't know what was going on.

35
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,660
There were only two present,

36
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,840
Gon and Youpi, who remained focused
on the enemy that faced them.

37
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,340
No way!

38
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,100
Has he lost it?

39
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,120
You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...

40
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,120
No, wait.

41
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,810
Realization came a moment later to Killua,

42
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,900
and still a few moments later to the others.

43
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Seriously, even in this situation,

44
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,380
how did he realize that, and so quickly?

45
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,910
If Meleoron and Knuckle were to
be pierced by a Dragon Lance

46
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,470
while God's Accomplice was
active, and die instantly,

47
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,390
would their invisibility cease?

48
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:22,350
Or would the Nen remain, leaving them to
decompose without anyone ever knowing?

49
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,650
No one knew the answer.

50
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,620
Assuming the latter, confirming whether they
were still alive would be impossible.

51
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,420
Meaning that, in the worst-case
scenario, someone else would

52
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,660
have to deal with Youpi.

53
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,920
That should have been my job...

54
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,670
Gon!

55
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,170
Shoot did nothing wrong.

56
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,350
Even I was later than Killua
in noticing and reacting.

57
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,430
Shoot, don't blame yourself...

58
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,790
Pull yourself together!

59
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,190
If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,

60
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,380
you're left with Pitou!

61
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,340
However,

62
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,400
Shoot was feeling a completely
different emotion at that moment.

63
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,660
Gon!

64
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,340
I want to tell the entire world...

65
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,820
"This is Gon!

66
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,290
A boy less than half my age,

67
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,060
to whom I owe my life."

68
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,580
I've always gone to any lengths
to avoid facing danger and risk,

69
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,320
hiding myself within a safe cage,
where no one could hurt me.

70
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,980
I hated myself for it...

71
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,870
But I couldn't change myself.

72
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,080
Friends and teachers encouraged me,

73
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,730
but I never truly listened,
considering it the logic of the strong.

74
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
Yet somehow...

75
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,840
A boy with less than half my strength

76
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,470
managed to break my cage!

77
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,640
Shoot did indeed tend to shrink
back weakly from opportunity.

78
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,650
I will survive...

79
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,400
So that I can thank you!

80
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,320
However, even he didn't realize that

81
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,460
such unique turns in his train of thought
made him shine in the face of adversity.

82
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,140
Good!

83
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,540
Knuckle and Meleoron...

84
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,940
...are alive!

85
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,700
What?

86
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,550
Who was it that just attacked me?

87
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,440
I couldn't see a thing...

88
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,580
Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?

89
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,300
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!

90
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,930
Naturally, they had already tested
to confirm that God's Accomplice

91
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,770
would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.

92
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,310
As long as God's Accomplice stayed active,
Youpi would be unable to see APR.

93
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,870
Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question

94
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,880
what had just happened, rather than
concentrate on the enemies before him.

95
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,730
I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.

96
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,990
Which means my focus right now should be...

97
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,140
So far, everything had proceeded
according to the Hunters' plan.

98
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:00,130
However, after a successful first strike,
Knuckle could only shudder.

99
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,640
Seriously?

100
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,600
It's like his aura is unlimited!

101
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,510
After surviving over five thousand battles,

102
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,980
Knuckle had the experience and intuition
to quantify his opponent's strength.

103
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,620
It was not uncommon for him to
face enemies who were stronger

104
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,550
than previous opponents he had encountered.

105
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,270
However, there was no comparing
the power he now faced

106
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,570
to that of the opponents who had come before.

107
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,930
A monster with an immense amount of aura.

108
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,110
Five times what the boss has?

109
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,570
Ten times?

110
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,520
More?

111
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,550
I can't tell!

112
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,750
He had never experienced anything like this.

113
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,940
Assuming he's ten times stronger,

114
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,620
with 700,000 aura,

115
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,740
how long will it take before he goes bust?

116
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,270
The King!

117
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,140
That was when

118
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,740
the Hunters felt

119
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,490
the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.

120
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,540
Youpi immediately noticed
that momentary hesitation.

121
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,030
Your Majesty!

122
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,680
Your Majesty!

123
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,340
Since Pitou lacked wings,

124
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,010
the only option was to continue free falling.

125
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,570
This was actually a stroke of luck.

126
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,720
Had there been unlimited courses of action,

127
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,710
Pitou would have joined Pouf and
rushed straight toward the King,

128
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,430
a Royal Guard's natural reaction.

129
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,220
In that scenario, it's unlikely
that Pitou would have had

130
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,040
the presence of mind to use En.

131
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,870
As a result...

132
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,080
The guest room on the second
floor of the west tower...

133
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,460
The King is with the woman with closed eyes.

134
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,950
They're also using En to locate the King!

135
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,660
This was when Pitou realized the
seriousness of the situation.

136
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,300
In that instant, Pitou crouched like the
four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,

137
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,950
with upper legs tensing like steel

138
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,470
until they were twice as large as they'd
been before the attack on Kite.

139
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,320
In order to reach the King

140
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,190
before the enemy could.

141
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,900
But a second later...

142
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,430
A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination

143
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,960
was strong enough to make
Pitou regret the decision.

144
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,540
This is...

145
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,950
the King's...

146
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,450
The aura coming from the King

147
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,930
was so unmasked, his current state
of mind was plain to read.

148
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,620
As a result, Pitou could only conclude

149
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,590
that the situation had grown
even worse than previously thought.

150
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,500
The main stairway had collapsed!

151
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,180
When the King looked down,
time began to move again.

152
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,820
However, time remained frozen for everyone else.

153
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,630
The intruders, who had come for the King's life,

154
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
were holding their breath and standing still

155
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,210
because of the girl covered in blood.

156
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,960
And because the grotesque
creature holding her body

157
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,440
was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.

158
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,490
Pitou.

159
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,490
Y-Yes, sir.

160
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,030
The expression on the King's face
had returned to normal.

161
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,850
This only increased Pitou's concern.

162
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,500
Heal Komugi.

163
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm counting on you.

164
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,760
The two veterans continued to stand by,

165
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
silently watching their enemies,

166
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,480
out of respect.

167
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,120
This was an act of love for a life.

168
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,580
Should they infringe upon that act,
their cause was lost.

169
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,670
It would have been inhumane.

170
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,580
This isn't what I was given to expect.

171
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,110
For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.

172
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,960
Netero felt the same way.

173
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,590
Not here.

174
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,260
Let us go elsewhere.

175
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,510
I believe that a different location

176
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,440
would be to your benefit, as well.

177
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,360
Netero had spent a great deal of money
to enlist Zeno to help separate

178
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,880
the King from the Royal Guard.

179
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,250
He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.

180
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,110
However...

181
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,040
Well, I suppose.

182
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,890
He could not help but feel
he had lost the initiative...

183
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,540
Doctor Blythe.

184
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,890
The moment Pitou's ability was activated,

185
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,680
the two men thought that their decision

186
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,550
to lower their guard would prove fatal.

187
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,360
Because the King was able to walk
between them with ease.

188
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,910
Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster.

189
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,920
Next time: An x Indebted x Insect.

190
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,070
Gon, what are you eating?

191
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,530
Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects.

192
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,850
I-Insects that are candy?
