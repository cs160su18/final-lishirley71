2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:11,490
Shroud

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,200
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,700
Yes, that truly was impressive.

23
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,220
I can see the progress you've made

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,530
from these last two fights.

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,630
Feel free to pick a time and place...

26
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,660
I shall be your opponent.

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,670
The x True x Pass

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,410
Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,

29
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,960
so he continues to train hard in Nen to prepare.

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,590
Today, we will finally begin to train in Hatsu.

31
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,810
Act

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,810
Once you master Hatsu,

33
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,660
you will have learned the basic Nen principles.

34
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,150
After that, you will need to work

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,850
on developing your individual Nen style.

36
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,200
Osu!

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,970
Hatsu is the technique
by which you control your Nen.

38
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,430
It is the culmination of Nen,

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,210
and there are six distinct categories.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,670
Enhancer

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,210
Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,970
Emitter

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,470
Emitters can propel their aura.

44
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,470
Transmuter

45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,970
Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,260
Conjurer

47
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,720
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,230
Manipulator

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,330
Manipulators can use their aura
to control objects and creatures.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:39,400
Specialist

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,780
Specialists are those with a
special aura that doesn't fall

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,010
within the other five classes.

53
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,780
The key is to find the power that suits you.

54
00:03:42,090 --> 00:04:32,750
Enhancer
Emitter
Transmuter
Conjurer
Manipulator
Specialist

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,450
The power that suits you?

56
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,670
Nen is linked to individual ability,

57
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,580
with two areas of particular prominence.

58
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,810
The first would be your natural potential.

59
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,590
The second would be potential
refined later in life.

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,550
Gon-kun, for example,

61
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,090
was born with a flexible, springy body.

62
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,100
His acute senses were the product
of a childhood spent in nature.

63
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,360
From the moment of birth, your Nen aura

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,700
falls within one of the six categories.

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,560
While rare, it is possible for your
Nen aura to later change types.

66
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,100
If you attempt to learn an ability

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,690
that does not fit your inclination,

68
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,730
you will find it very difficult.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,640
Act

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:05:03,490
Emitter
Manipulator

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:05:03,490
Specialist

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:05:03,490
Enhancer

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:05:03,490
Transmuter
Conjurer

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,390
This hexagon depicts the relationship

75
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,800
among the six categories.

76
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,380
The closer a class is to your own,

77
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,000
the higher your compatibility to learn it.

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,550
If you are born with an aura

79
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,920
of the Enhancer category,

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,160
you will find Enhancer abilities easiest

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,500
to learn and master.

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,980
And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes

83
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,220
will also be easy to learn.

84
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,820
On the other hand, the Specialist class,

85
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,650
which is furthest away, would be difficult.

86
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,740
To illustrate, I'll use skills
that you've seen for yourselves.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
Hisoka was able to change

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,660
his aura into a rubbery substance.

89
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,250
This would be a Transmuter ability.

90
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,580
Gido used his tops and body as
weapons by making them spin faster,

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,500
which would be an Enhancer power.

92
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,350
However, since using so many tops as weapons

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,890
also requires Manipulator skill,
he wasn't as successful.

94
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,660
As for Kastro,

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,560
his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,650
Had he mastered it, he would have
been among the strongest Nen users.

97
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,550
I believe that his aura fell
into the Enhancer class.

98
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,390
However, he focused his energy on
the power to create a double,

99
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,870
which is a Conjurer skill.

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,250
And he also required a Manipulator
ability to control the double.

101
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,440
Both of those are relatively far

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,880
from the Enhancer category.

103
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,900
So neither was compatible
with an Enhancer type?

104
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,860
Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and

105
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,890
natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.

106
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,440
And as a result,

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,950
he squandered most of his Nen potential.

108
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,880
So he made the wrong choice.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,610
He was a great fighter...

110
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,840
It's a shame.

111
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,840
Well?

112
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,930
Do you see the importance

113
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,040
of understanding your own
auras and inclinations?

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,130
Osu!

115
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,280
Given that,

116
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,790
is there any way to learn which
category your aura falls into?

117
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,540
There is.

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,990
Water Divination,

119
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,260
a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.

120
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,180
It's also used in Hatsu training.

121
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,410
You place your hands beside
the cup, and use Ren.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,690
The result will reveal your category.

123
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,650
The water's overflowing...

124
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,700
If the amount of water changes,

125
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,630
that means you are an Enhancer.

126
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,210
This shows that my aura falls
within the Enhancer class.

127
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,470
Okay, now it's your turn.

128
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,300
Gon's an Enhancer, too?

129
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,800
The leaf moved!

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,670
If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.

131
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,620
Okay, I'm last!

132
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Nothing's happening.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,750
Indeed...

134
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,510
The leaf isn't moving.

135
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,740
Do I not have any potential?

136
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,700
Not at all.

137
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,580
Taste the water.

138
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,770
Taste it?

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,850
It might be a little sweet...

140
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,560
You're right.

141
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,020
Yes, it's a bit sweet.

142
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,280
Isn't this just water?

143
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,610
It's just water.

144
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,410
But the taste changed.

145
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,770
Because of Killua-kun's aura.

146
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,100
And that means?

147
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,920
You are a Transmuter.

148
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,870
Oh!

149
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,670
A Transmuter?

150
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,400
Now, you three know

151
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,950
how your auras are classified.

152
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,850
Use the next four weeks

153
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,680
to train hard, so the Water Divination
results become more pronounced.

154
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,780
Osu!

155
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,190
June 11th

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
June 16th

157
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,210
June 20th

158
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,210
Hello?

159
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,240
This is Gon.

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,130
Ah, I have been waiting...

161
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,250
Have you decided when we should fight?

162
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,730
Yeah, July 10th.

163
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,060
That's the day!

164
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,630
Okay.

165
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,150
I can hardly wait...

166
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
June 22nd

167
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,260
June 30th

168
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,270
July 5th

169
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,360
Now, show me what you've
accomplished with your training.

170
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,410
Killua-kun, you're first.

171
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,530
Okay.

172
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm done.

173
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,140
It's sweet!

174
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,430
Wow, it tastes like honey.

175
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,440
Excellent.

176
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,490
Zushi, you're next.

177
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,470
Osu!

178
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,580
This is the best I can manage...

179
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,150
That's fine.

180
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,830
But it won't be enough to pass.

181
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,440
You'll need to train some more.

182
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,460
Osu.

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,790
Gon-kun, you're next.

184
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,090
Osu!

185
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,220
Stop...

186
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,270
Stop, Gon-kun!

187
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,280
The water increased with so
much force, it cracked the glass.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,530
Honestly...

189
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,530
You really are something.

190
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,850
I was feeling pretty good about this.

191
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,210
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.

192
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,920
Today is your graduation day.

193
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,790
Huh?

194
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,710
Really?

195
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,220
We did it, Killua!

196
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,100
Yeah.

197
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,420
Master, what about me?

198
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,430
You still need to train a bit more.

199
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,310
Osu.

200
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,580
Keep at it.

201
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,110
You can do it!

202
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,930
Osu...

203
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,620
And, Gon-kun...

204
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,180
Huh?

205
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,440
I have something important to tell you.

206
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,070
Something important?

207
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,450
Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed
the Secret Hunter Exam!

208
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,370
Huh?

209
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,720
You've passed.

210
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,700
Congratulations.

211
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,490
The Secret Hunter Exam?

212
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,740
Correct.

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,190
You were able to pass.

214
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,340
What do you mean?

215
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,540
You are required to learn Nen
before becoming a Hunter,

216
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,100
as professional Hunters are
expected to be exceptionally strong.

217
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,100
One of your basic tasks

218
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,800
as a Hunter will be apprehending
evil poachers and criminals.

219
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,360
You must be strong enough to fight crime.

220
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,350
However, this power is highly
destructive when used for wrongdoing.

221
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,490
Revealing the existence of Nen
during the Exam would be dangerous.

222
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,820
Therefore,

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,000
the test is only administered to
those who pass the public Exam.

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Oh, so you were going to teach us,

225
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,850
or at least Gon, all along...

226
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,500
Yes.

227
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,320
I should mention that the
head Shingen-ryu master

228
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,010
is Chairman Netero.

229
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,090
The master has told me much about you.

230
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,720
That old man...

231
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,140
Killua-kun.

232
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,900
Please take the Hunter Exam again.

233
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,730
You will definitely pass next time.

234
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,520
Huh?

235
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Yeah.

236
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,890
You are more than qualified.

237
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,530
I guarantee it.

238
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,280
Yeah, if I feel up to it.

239
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,160
Hey, Wing-san...

240
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,500
Have you heard anything about
the others who passed?

241
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,290
Sure.

242
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,290
Hanzo and Kurapika

243
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,420
have learned Nen from other teachers.

244
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,470
Pokkle is struggling with Ren.

245
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,430
Leorio has begun studying for
the medical school exam.

246
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,830
Hisoka and Illumi already knew Nen,

247
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,560
so they were qualified.

248
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,700
Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.

249
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,740
Yeah.

250
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,820
Now, Gon-kun,

251
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,450
I have one warning for you.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,220
When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,

253
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,200
don't push yourself too hard.

254
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,640
All right?

255
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,570
Yes, sir!

256
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,680
Zushi, you will continue
training for four more weeks.

257
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,570
Osu...

258
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,730
You should have more confidence.

259
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,220
You are progressing at an incredible pace.

260
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.

261
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,820
One in a hundred thousand?

262
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,230
O-Osu!

263
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,980
However,

264
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,740
those two are one-in-ten-million talents.

265
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,430
Osu!

266
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,990
That doesn't make me feel any better, master...

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
But...

268
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,870
One day,

269
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,040
I will definitely catch up!

270
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,740
Hello, everyone!

271
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,530
In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.

272
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,970
This is the fight you've all been waiting for.

273
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,040
As you can see, the stands are packed.

274
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,160
The tension in the air before the
start of this match is almost unreal!

275
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,730
How much longer?

276
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,420
Get this thing started!

277
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,670
Gon is the first to arrive!

278
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,100
After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.

279
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,630
He's on a roll!

280
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,700
You can do it, Gon!

281
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,740
Don't you need your fishing rod?

282
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,210
You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!

283
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,710
And next, with a fiery display...

284
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,080
Hisoka appears!

285
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,260
His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh

286
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,100
in everyone's minds.

287
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,310
His record is 9-3.

288
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,800
If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.

289
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,110
If he loses, he falls all the way down.

290
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,860
However, he has yet to lose
when he steps into the ring!

291
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,110
Will his undefeated record continue?

292
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,630
Oh...

293
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,880
Don't look at me like that.

294
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,390
Schwing

295
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,240
I'm getting turned on.

296
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,300
What a sinister aura.

297
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,640
Gon-kun, don't overdo it.

298
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,900
Points and KO system.

299
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,160
No time limit!

300
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,300
One round!

301
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,660
Begin!

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,930
This is the match you've been waiting for.

303
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,670
The die has been cast!

304
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,340
Who will make the first move?

305
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,550
It's Gon!

306
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,170
A clean hit!

307
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,450
One point to Hisoka!

308
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,780
Wh-What an intense exchange.

309
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,210
I never even got to sneak in a word!

310
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,330
What's wrong?

311
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,470
I still haven't moved a step from where I started.

312
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,140
Huh? Really?

313
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,600
Damn!

314
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
Just you wait!

315
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,510
Okay, I don't have to try to
hit him with every attack.

316
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,110
I can use some feints to get the same effect.

317
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,610
Hisoka's enjoying himself.

318
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,610
In terms of actual skill,
there's an insurmountable gap.

319
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,120
But he still has a weakness.

320
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,540
Hisoka knows that he's stronger,

321
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,620
so he won't retreat.

322
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,000
That gives Gon an opening!

323
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,420
In that case, I'll try that!

324
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,190
There it is!

325
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,190
Gon's Stone Flip!

326
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,690
He shattered the block to
create a hail of rubble.

327
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,450
Gon...

328
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,450
Where is he?

329
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,110
Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.

330
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,060
However, he will soon receive a taste

331
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,530
of Hisoka's true power.

332
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,440
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

333
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

334
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

335
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

336
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

337
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

338
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

339
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
