2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,320
Together, there are five of you?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,480
Yeah, this is all of us.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,370
There are two others in my group.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,980
This only gives us a total of nine.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,370
Where do you plan to find the rest?

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,520
We'll need fifteen members, right?

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,120
We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,880
Invite players who want to return
to the real world but can't.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,140
They won't be able to help,

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,380
but they won't care about
receiving cards, either.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,770
Meaning that the nine of us will
have to win the contest.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,950
I don't know how strong our
opponents are, but can we?

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,390
We can.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,620
Even if we can't manage eight wins,

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,090
we're allowed to switch members and try again.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,400
So whether we can win depends on you guys.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,900
Show us your Ren.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,580
We'll decide if we want you afterwards.

20
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,030
A x Heated x Showdown

21
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,310
I see our roles have been reversed.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,580
Very well.

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,980
Here I go!

24
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,550
Awesome!

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,050
If I use my full strength, I can fly higher.

26
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,060
My record is sixteen meters,
eighty centimeters.

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,960
Ready, and...

28
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,690
They shattered my record with ease.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,780
Ha ha, I win.

30
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,700
How much have they improved
in such a short period of time?

31
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,870
Darn!

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
I am impressed.

33
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,240
Although you still fall a bit
short of my full height.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,330
Okay! Let's go again!

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,760
No way.

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
You won't stop until you win.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,410
One more time... Just once more!

38
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,640
Oh, you passed.

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,590
Nice jump.

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,450
Sorry...

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,410
Once more!

42
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,590
They're only kids, so let it slide.

43
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,590
Fine.

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,500
We believe that you guys are strong.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,620
But it comes down to figuring out
who to assign to which sport.

46
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,590
Killua, once more!

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,150
See, I knew it...

48
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,350
No more. I win!

49
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,350
Do we know all the sports they'll use?

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
We've managed to confirm these eight.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,860
Beach Volleyball
Wrestling
Boxing
Juggling
Free Throws
Sumo
Bowling
Ping Pong

52
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,860
Depending on our success,
they may add additional sports.

53
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,280
I understand...

54
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,120
Hey, this is bad!

55
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,880
What is it?

56
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,620
Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.

57
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,870
Then they're only missing...

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,560
Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!

59
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,600
Over the past week, we've run various simulations

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,140
and have prepared accordingly.

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,770
Given Team Genthru's current situation,

62
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,890
we can't afford to lose.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,800
We have to win!

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Yes, we'll win.

65
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,900
This isn't too bad...

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,080
Okay, let's go.

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,660
We'll begin with boxing.

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,780
I'll send you packing.

69
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,790
His special ability is teleportation.

70
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,050
He can teleport his uppercut.

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,550
Fight!

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,850
H-He's fast!

73
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,100
An infighter?

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,850
If I'm close enough, his Emitter
advantages are worthless.

75
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,910
He'll be so busy guarding,

76
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,360
he won't have a chance to use teleportation!

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,780
Nice!

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,800
The pattern depicted on the ring

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,660
is a sacred symbol that boosts Nen.

80
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,120
Suggesting that he can only teleport

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,040
while standing within the ring.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,540
Essentially, he's revealing that
he isn't all that strong.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,740
An opponent unworthy of us.

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,300
The winner is Barry!

85
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,650
Yes!

86
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,170
The winner is Rodriot!

87
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,380
The winner is Kess!

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes!

89
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,330
That's three wins!

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,740
In terms of combat strength,

91
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,020
those six are very strong.

92
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
This is getting interesting...

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,250
You guys can toss your matches.

94
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,500
I'll take it from here.

95
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,040
Roger that.

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,250
Wait!

97
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,610
I'm done following your orders.

98
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,260
I'll be doing things my own way now.

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,890
Hey, brat! Let's step outside!

100
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,020
Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?

101
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,090
I'm done playing around.

102
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,350
Want me to kill you here?

103
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,560
Hey, Bobobo!

104
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,360
That's a violation of our agreement.

105
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,780
Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
I don't give a damn!

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,190
I'm done playing this stupid game!

108
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,380
Anyone else with me?

109
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,910
If we team up, we can crush that bastard.

110
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,170
And then we can use a ship
to get off this island!

111
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,320
You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.

112
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Didn't I warn you?

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,210
Y-Yes, you did...

114
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,970
Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?

115
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,820
Okay, I'll go next.

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,320
Hey, this looks bad.

117
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,010
We can't fight those guys...

118
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,370
No, hold on.

119
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,150
We'll be doing the fighting.

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,850
We explained how this works.

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,040
If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories,

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,990
you can just forfeit without fighting.

123
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,830
Really?

124
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,670
You guarantee we won't have to fight?

125
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,340
Yeah, don't worry.

126
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,320
That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.

127
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,570
And judging by the previous conversation,

128
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,160
he must be a Game Master.

129
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,650
Can I ask something?

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,570
That guy's dead.

131
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,350
What about the sumo match?

132
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,840
Hmm? Oh, you get the win.

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,030
But we never decided who we were sending.

134
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,040
You're the one who said you
were going to do the sumo.

135
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't care who you give the win to.

136
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,110
Just give it to one of the guys
standing in the back.

137
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,310
Okay, you get the sumo win.

138
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,050
Eh? Wait, me?

139
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,620
That gives us four wins.

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,550
Now, then...

141
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,050
I'll go with an eight-on-eight game

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,200
of dodgeball.

143
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,570
Pick the eight members you'll field.

144
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,620
I already have mine.

145
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,690
Hold on...

146
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,030
How is this scored?

147
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,690
It's one win per person, right?

148
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,580
Yes, one win per person.

149
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,580
So the victorious team receives eight wins.

150
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,230
Simple enough, yes?

151
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,890
So that was the plan?

152
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,160
No matter how many of his weaker members

153
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,340
we defeat, he can still win
the entire game alone.

154
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,390
Razor and the fourteen devils...

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,850
The devils are his Nen ability!

156
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm against this...

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
If we have to field eight, you need two more!

158
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm not fighting that guy!

159
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,730
I'm leaving now...

160
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,760
Once the match begins,

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,410
you can deliberately let yourself be hit—

162
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,810
Screw that!

163
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,210
Didn't you see that?

164
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,620
If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!

165
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,110
Oh, just so everything is clear,
we'll be using a normal ball.

166
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,130
But with Nen, it's just as strong as
the Nen projectile I launched earlier.

167
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,660
This is crazy... I'm outta here!

168
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,130
Sorry, but I don't want to die yet...

169
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,140
H-Hold on!

170
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,890
We'll think of something real quick.

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,630
This is very bad.

172
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,830
We only have six players of any use.

173
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,810
So we're forced to pick two
of these spineless wimps.

174
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,400
We'll do this by ourselves.

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
If our lives are on the line,

176
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,050
we should only field willing players.

177
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,400
Do you have a problem if we only field six?

178
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,680
Yes, actually, I can't let you do that...

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,800
You will have to field eight members.

180
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?

181
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,630
Saying this to an in-game character
is probably pointless,

182
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,100
but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?

183
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,390
What did he do to deserve death?

184
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,480
Burglary-murder and rape-murder.

185
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,150
Eleven confirmed counts alone.

186
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,770
This is the real world.

187
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,030
This place, Greed Island, is located
somewhere in the real world.

188
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,030
This game takes place in the real world.

189
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,330
Revealing that information to a player who
believes they're inside a game is a taboo.

190
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,540
Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.

191
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,720
This guy, Razor, is a Game Master,

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,350
a real human.

193
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,050
Game Master?

194
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,210
One of the people who made this game.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,660
Huh?

196
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
Wait, then...

197
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,220
Bobobo and the other pirates
are real death row criminals.

198
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,750
Not only did he disobey orders;
he attempted to instigate an escape.

199
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,070
Execution was a fair consequence.

200
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,020
This is the real world?

201
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,820
That is correct.

202
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,590
I never noticed.

203
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,080
I hadn't even considered that.

204
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,010
Well, it doesn't really matter.

205
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,770
Since this island is still isolated
from the rest of the world.

206
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,710
Wait a second.

207
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,340
If this is the real world,

208
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
does that mean that Ging is here,

209
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,720
on Greed Island?

210
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,740
Ging?

211
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,050
Ah...

212
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,430
So you must be Gon.

213
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,490
Yeah.

214
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,940
I was instructed not to go easy on you

215
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,980
by your old man.

216
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,160
I've had enough...

217
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
I don't wanna die!

218
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,790
Count me out! I'm gone!

219
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,250
H-Hey!

220
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,210
It's okay, let them leave.

221
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,000
But then we can't have a match!

222
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,510
I'll count as three.

223
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,320
You're doing the same thing,

224
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,870
so it shouldn't be a problem.

225
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,520
Yeah, that's fine.

226
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,180
Now it's eight-on-eight.

227
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,020
I'll explain the rules.

228
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,620
The game starts with one outside
player and seven inside.

229
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,730
The first team to run out of inside players loses.

230
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,030
Any player inside the court who's hit by
a ball thrown by an opponent is out,

231
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,350
and must move outside.

232
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,040
However,

233
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,530
you may bring one player inside
the court again by saying "Back."

234
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,290
And if the ball hits an area outside
the court, without any players,

235
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,810
the opposing team gets the ball.

236
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,930
Now, the important stuff...

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,560
The rules regarding hits
employ a cushion effect.

238
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,100
For example, if I throw the ball
and it hits opposing player A, ricochets,

239
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,680
and hits opposing player B
before hitting the floor,

240
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,570
both A and B are out.

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,470
But if player B in that scenario
is able to catch the ball,

242
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,700
player A is safe.

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,810
Exactly.

244
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,270
But if I throw the ball and it
hits opposing player A, ricochets,

245
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,180
and hits my teammate, player C,
before hitting the floor,

246
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,830
only player C is out.

247
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,590
Then if player C catches the ball,
does that mean player A is out?

248
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,220
Indeed.

249
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,010
Uh...

250
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,570
Do you have a question?

251
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,390
If an outside player hits someone
with the ball, is the hit player out?

252
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,100
Naturally, they're out.

253
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,320
But only one player

254
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,190
can return to the court using Back.

255
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,090
I am Number 0, the ref.

256
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,980
Let's have a clean game.

257
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,170
We will now begin the game.

258
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,990
Ready...

259
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,870
Go!

260
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,250
You can make the first move.

261
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,650
You sound quite confident.

262
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,470
Here's a little greeting, then!

263
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,400
You got him!

264
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,890
Yes! That's one down!

265
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,400
Good!

266
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,150
Let's keep this up.

267
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,400
There!

268
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Okay, that's two down!

269
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,870
Oh, this is easy.

270
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,030
Okay, all ready to go...

271
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,030
Huh? What did you say?

272
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm prepared to defeat you now.

273
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Heh, that's funny.

274
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,550
Show us what you've got!

275
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,550
H-He stopped it with one hand?

276
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,990
Right, then...

277
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,770
Time to launch the counterattack.

278
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,320
He's standing so far back...

279
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,780
Is he going to pass it?

280
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,570
Fast!

281
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,420
Can I dodge it?

282
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,320
No way!

283
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,570
Can I catch it and live?

284
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,080
No!

285
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
I'll die!

286
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,080
Death

287
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,080
White Goreinu!

288
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,840
Nice rebound.

289
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,600
Goreinu's outside the court!

290
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,290
I see...

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,110
You have the ability to change
places with your Nen beasts.

292
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,090
The Nen creature was shattered...

293
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,240
This reflects what Goreinu imagined would
happen when he saw Razor's attack.

294
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,730
He immediately grasped the gap between
our opponent's strength and his own.

295
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,450
He won't easily rid himself of that image.

296
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,120
It'll be impossible for him to
recover during this match.

297
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,130
He's done.

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,660
Goreinu's Nen beast is the one that's out, right?

299
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,640
Yes, the exchange was performed
with Nen, so it broke no rules.

300
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,620
However, Back must be used to
bring Goreinu inside the court.

301
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,730
Damn... Is this how it ends?

302
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,460
All right, let's move on!

303
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,690
That pass is so fast!

304
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,200
I-It's too fast...

305
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,580
I can't follow the ball!

306
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,230
Tsezgerra!

307
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,950
Behind you!

308
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,510
It's heavy...

309
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,620
As heavy as a bowling ball.

310
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,990
This is gonna have insane power.

311
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,290
He focused his aura in his back,
and avoided a lethal blow.

312
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,230
Hey, patch him up.

313
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,670
I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.

314
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,740
If a player is unable to continue
playing, they're disqualified.

315
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,720
They won't be allowed

316
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,240
to play in or outside the court,
so keep that in mind.

317
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,480
Are you okay?

318
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,500
Yeah, I've really lost it...

319
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,160
Damn, in overall combat ability,

320
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,390
I should still be stronger than they are.

321
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,510
But when it comes to the basics like
agility and reflexes, they have me beat.

322
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,530
It's been a while since I've
had to work really hard.

323
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,520
Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.

324
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,030
I don't think I've done any basic
training in the past few years.

325
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,800
Ideally, we could knock out
everyone on the other team

326
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,030
without giving up the ball.

327
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,990
Hisoka...

328
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,540
Okay, give me the ball.

329
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,540
Oh, that's right.

330
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,030
If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can
retrieve the ball after it hits!

331
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,000
Now, do try to entertain me.

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,300
Surely this isn't everything you have.

333
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,810
Very well...

334
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,310
Okay, that's three down!

335
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,810
With Back, the other team still has five players!

336
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,350
With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive.

337
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,010
All that's left is the order we target them.

338
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,880
Question for the ref.

339
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Can the last player inside the court

340
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,070
use Back at the second he's hit?

341
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,780
That's not allowed.

342
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,130
For a moment, there would
be zero players in the court,

343
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,080
so that team would lose.

344
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
But someone outside the court may use Back

345
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,070
at the instant that the last player is hit.

346
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,590
Okay.

347
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,920
Hisoka...

348
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,590
Yes, I understand.

349
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,840
We leave him for last.

350
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
He throws a strong ball.

351
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,850
Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it.

352
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,940
Nice and strong!

353
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,820
If we're lucky, we can take out
6 and 7 at the same time!

354
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,270
Th-They combined?

355
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,760
You're strong.

356
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,360
Is that allowed?!

357
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,390
It is.

358
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,120
If you're allowed to combine,
are you allowed to split?

359
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,150
Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum
number of players on the court.

360
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,260
Now!

361
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,760
It's my turn to attack again.

362
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,120
Now we have to retake the ball again.

363
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,390
If we're going to stop his ball...

364
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,480
Ken!

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,790
Their Nen is smooth and quite beautiful.

366
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,100
They must have trained hard.

367
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,040
But if Razor throws the ball at full strength,

368
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,670
Ken won't be enough.

369
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,090
They must be prepared for casualties
when they recover the ball

370
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,540
and try to defeat him.

371
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,820
Is it even possible?

372
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,210
So you know how to use Ken.

373
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,940
That means you won't die.

374
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,550
However...

375
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.

376
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,510
Here I come,

377
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,310
Gon!

378
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,560
Bring it!

379
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,800
It won't work! Run away!

380
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,340
You'll die!

381
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,720
Ko!

382
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,220
Gon!

383
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,540
Where's the ball?

384
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,860
Crazy...

385
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,840
It's drilled in there.

386
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,160
Gon!

387
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,340
Are you okay?!

388
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,650
I'm just fine!

389
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,850
The hell you are...

390
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,820
I used Ko to harden my arms and head,

391
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,100
but my legs couldn't take the impact.

392
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,830
However,

393
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,690
next time,

394
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,110
I'll catch it!

395
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,450
Gon is now fired up.

396
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:08,430
G.I. Tutorial

397
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,860
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

398
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,580
Today, we introduce the card Accompany.

399
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:18,750
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

400
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,170
It lets you warp everyone within 20 meters.

401
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,100
What if a player is 21 meters large?

402
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,920
Continue!

403
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,660
Next time: Guts x And x Courage.

404
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,960
Receive!

405
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,630
Toss!

406
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,720
Attack!

407
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,760
But we're using aura...

408
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,310
Because we're Hunters!
