00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,010
Heavens Arena.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,280
The 251-story, 991-meter building

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,530
is a mecca for fighters.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,420
When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,460
and receive a corresponding reward.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,030
After reaching the 100th floor,

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,170
you are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,610
After reaching the 200th floor,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,010
the Floor Masters, in an
intense battle of survival.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,880
This is the best stage

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,890
a warrior could ask for.

14
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,730
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.

15
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,230
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.

16
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,240
Then I just need to find three more chumps.

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,020
And I'll be a Floor Master.

18
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,720
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.

19
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,920
Move, and I will kill you...

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,850
Use Nen, and I will kill you.

21
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,620
Make a sound, and I will kill you.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.

23
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,540
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,770
If you know, slowly open your eyes.

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,700
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.

26
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,450
Never show your filthy face to us again.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,780
That's a promise.

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,790
Power x To x Avenge

29
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,770
There are many who would use

30
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,730
underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,700
On the other hand,

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Gon has concentrated on improving
his Nen and growing stronger.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,640
And tonight,

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,830
he has his battle with Sadaso.

35
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,310
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,040
I was overcome with despair.

37
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,060
The second he looked at me,

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,730
I felt a difference in strength

39
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,850
that made me realize my
helplessness against him.

40
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,780
It was a mistake to underestimate him,

41
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,950
and to assume he was some normal kid.

42
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm gonna disappear

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,840
because I don't wanna die...

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,750
Be careful.

45
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,990
You guys are next.

46
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,800
What should we do?

47
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,980
I'm still in.

48
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,260
I'll do whatever it takes.

49
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,860
I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,620
Ten victories in the 200s

51
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,870
win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.

52
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,260
Should you triumph, you get
an entire floor to yourself.

53
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,030
And once you've earned the
title of Floor Master,

54
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,270
you can lecture, serve as an advisor,

55
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,000
or start a new martial arts school.

56
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,170
You can live off the title for
the rest of your life.

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,580
Will that kid try threatening us?

58
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,360
The boy doesn't know my power.

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,260
As long as we're careful, we can handle him.

60
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,420
You're wrong.

61
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,020
It's irrelevant to me what your power is.

62
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,480
I can threaten you whenever I want.

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,790
Whenever and wherever I choose...

64
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,170
When you're sound asleep...

65
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,390
When you're taking a dump.

66
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,220
Got it?

67
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,190
Now, listen up.

68
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,570
You have to follow the rules.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,570
Without rules,

70
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,630
we are the ones who would benefit.

71
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,260
Cheating really is a bad idea.

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,400
We'll have a fair fight.

73
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,270
Right.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,660
Time has run out for Sadaso.

75
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,600
Gon wins by default!

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,260
What? Again?

77
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,790
What is Sadaso doing?

78
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,050
June 1st

79
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,580
June 2nd

80
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,500
June 3rd

81
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,050
June 4th

82
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,020
Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today.

83
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,550
Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.

84
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,090
Are you feeling all right?

85
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,930
Yes.

86
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,190
Gon-kun, this will be your
second match with Gido.

87
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,200
So you shouldn't require much advice.

88
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,070
Do you have a plan?

89
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,320
Uh-huh.

90
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Um, Wing-san, actually...

91
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm planning to use this.

92
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,080
I see...

93
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,680
Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match...

94
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,740
Gido versus Gon.

95
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,060
In their previous encounter,

96
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,220
Gon ended up in the hospital,

97
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,880
but what will happen this time?

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,010
Today, he's carrying a fishing rod.

99
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,850
How does he plan to use it?

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,150
How does he intend to fight?

101
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,480
Let's get this contest started!

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,570
Points and KO system.

103
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,080
No time limit!

104
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,610
Begin!

105
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,410
Wow! Gon's already taken off!

106
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,040
But Gido was also prepared, as he's
already using Tornado Top!

107
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,100
If Gon charges in,

108
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,960
he'll be in the same position as before.

109
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
So he anticipated that.

110
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,800
I know exactly what you're thinking...

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,770
Once I've begun to spin,
it's extremely hard to stop me.

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,520
Thus, the logical course

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,270
would be a preemptive attack before I start.

114
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,940
What's wrong?

115
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,240
If you won't make a move, I'll go first.

116
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,840
Shotgun Blues!

117
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,990
Shotgun Blues

118
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,370
He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?

119
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,490
This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.

120
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,640
Every top will be aiming for you.

121
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,620
You can't avoid them all!

122
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,800
Ren!

123
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,130
What?

124
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,280
He stopped them!

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,860
Did you see that?

126
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,140
Wow...

127
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,510
Incredible!

128
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,890
He stopped the tops in their tracks!

129
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,530
He clearly isn't the same
person as two months ago!

130
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,620
His Nen defense is far stronger now.

131
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,990
I can't win with my tops?

132
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,290
Gon's reflexes are good enough

133
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,250
to let him use his rod to knock down any tops

134
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,800
that are stupid enough to come straight at him.

135
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,950
But he chose to use Ren

136
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,300
to deal more psychological damage.

137
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,010
He must be pretty mad

138
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,320
about how they used Zushi.

139
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,310
It's my turn now!

140
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,430
Well, what technique will Gon use?

141
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,440
If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,070
he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning.

143
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,200
But it won't be that simple.

144
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,190
There he goes...

145
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,370
Straight for Gido!

146
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,790
I knew it.

147
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,960
But that won't do you any good!

148
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,470
Oh, his attack missed!

149
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,720
What were you aiming at?

150
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,740
What?!

151
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,190
Unbelievable...

152
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,070
Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!

153
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,590
Wait!

154
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,860
G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.

155
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,740
Gido can no longer continue to fight.

156
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,340
If you're willing to do whatever it takes,

157
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,190
I won't hold back.

158
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,340
And if you touch Zushi again,

159
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,300
I'll smash your face in!

160
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,200
Our winner is Gon!

161
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,400
Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!

162
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,210
His record in the 200s is now 2-1!

163
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,780
Okay, it's my turn now.

164
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,470
All right, up next is our main event...

165
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,190
Killua versus Riehlvelt!

166
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,470
Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match,

167
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,100
this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match.

168
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,290
What will his strategy be?

169
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,770
You're the ones who broke your promise.

170
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,150
I won't let you win now.

171
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,740
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.

172
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,360
An underworld dweller, huh?

173
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,200
This boy may be a professional there,

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,100
but Heavens Arena is my turf.

175
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,010
I'll show him that, on this square stage,

176
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,490
I'm better.

177
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,240
Fight, Killua-san!

178
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,640
Points and KO system.

179
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
No time limit!

180
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,750
Begin!

181
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,350
He disappeared?

182
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,310
Behind me!

183
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,670
Aura Burst!

184
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Aura Burst

185
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,940
Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!

186
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,120
He uses the propulsion created
by releasing his stored aura

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,820
to control his wheelchair at will.

188
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,070
I moved too fast.

189
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,120
Whew, that was close...

190
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,450
Twin Snakes:

191
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,200
Song of Defense!

192
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,260
Song of Defense

193
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,670
There it is!

194
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,330
His Song of Defense...

195
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,970
Riehlvelt protects himself with two
whips moving at ridiculous speed,

196
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,170
while he awaits his opportunity to strike.

197
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,760
You planned to attack first and take the lead.

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
Too bad it didn't work...

199
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,610
Now that I've switched to this stance,

200
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,030
you have no chance of winning.

201
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,410
Why not?

202
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,700
That should be obvious.

203
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,290
A normal person can't even see the whips move!

204
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,540
And this small ring offers no
means to hide or escape.

205
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,840
Take this!

206
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,610
Sorry, but I'm not a normal person.

207
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,170
What?!

208
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,740
But...

209
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,500
Thunder Snake!

210
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,500
True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake

211
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,180
I'm astonished, Killua.

212
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,140
You're the first person I've fought

213
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,020
who could see my whips move.

214
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,520
So I have a present for you...

215
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,650
Together, my whips carry a
one million volt current.

216
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,600
Enough to paralyze and
incapacitate the largest of men.

217
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Any fool who resists my whips

218
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,040
will fall prey to Thunder Snake!

219
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,450
I'm accustomed to electrical currents

220
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,660
from the torture training I've endured.

221
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,040
It has no effect on me.

222
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,730
But that just means I can bear the pain.

223
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,800
It still hurts.

224
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,180
That's why I'm a little pissed.

225
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,270
If you fall from that height, you'll die!

226
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,060
What do you want?

227
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,280
P-Please catch me!

228
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,230
Okay.

229
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,980
Just come to me.

230
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,960
Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?

231
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,220
Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.

232
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,090
Our winner is Killua!

233
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,980
Nice, Killua!

234
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,890
You're up next.

235
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,390
You're fighting him in six days?

236
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,620
Uh-huh, June 10th.

237
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,560
My win was only possible
because of who I am...

238
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,740
If you're hit by those electric whips,

239
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,090
you'll be knocked out cold.

240
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,130
Yeah.

241
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,010
What's your plan?

242
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,760
Don't worry. I have an idea.

243
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,120
Oh?

244
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,130
In spirit, you were fighting
even as you watched me.

245
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,770
I guess you prefer actual combat
to being a spectator.

246
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,770
June 9th

247
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
It appears that the damage

248
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,730
Gido suffered in his match
with Gon was so severe,

249
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,170
he hasn't returned for today's fight.

250
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,390
Killua wins by default.

251
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,660
June 10th

252
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,850
After losing to Killua,

253
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,310
Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3,
leaving him no more chances.

254
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,940
As you know, after four losses,
you're out of the contest.

255
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,730
You'll have to start over from the beginning.

256
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,110
He appears wary of Gon's speed,

257
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,580
as he already has his whips out.

258
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,700
Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod...

259
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,670
How does he plan to fight?

260
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,090
Begin!

261
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,840
Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!

262
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,090
Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!

263
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,100
Oh, Gon is squatting?

264
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,290
Amazing...

265
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,990
He pried a floor tile loose by himself!

266
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,950
And then he threw it!

267
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,160
Aura Burst!

268
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,740
Whoa, he barely managed to escape!

269
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,000
He left that escape route open on purpose.

270
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,970
What?

271
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,110
However, Gon has already anticipated him.

272
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,870
When you try to escape,
every fraction of a second counts.

273
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,490
And since there isn't time to change direction,

274
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,800
you're forced to move forward...

275
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,380
And when you dash quickly,
you're usually off-balance.

276
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,480
His only option is to stop the whips.

277
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
That's where you get him...

278
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,420
This is the switch?

279
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,690
Let's see...

280
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,860
I'll turn the power to maximum.

281
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,800
S-Stop...

282
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,190
Switch

283
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,190
Stop it!

284
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,070
on!

285
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
Just kidding.

286
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,700
Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.

287
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,830
Our winner is Gon!

288
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,830
Gon-san!

289
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,320
Yes, that truly was impressive.

290
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
I can see the progress you've made

291
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,870
from these last two fights.

292
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,250
Feel free to pick a time and place...

293
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,830
I shall be your opponent.

294
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,370
Hisoka has recognized the strength

295
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,760
Gon demonstrated during his matches.

296
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,200
Their fight will soon begin.

297
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

298
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

299
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

300
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

301
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

302
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

303
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

304
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

305
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:19,960
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

306
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,640
Today, we introduce Cocco.

307
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,660
A Heavens Arena
commentator.

308
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,440
She's a Heavens Arena commentator.

309
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh, the lady who's always talking?

310
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,920
She knows how to get
the crowd excited.

311
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,090
I wonder how many of her there are.

312
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,460
Uh, there's just one!

313
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,300
Next time: The x True x Pass!

314
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,260
Hey, Killua.

315
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,300
What does "yadda yadda" mean?

316
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,660
You don't know?

317
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,930
It means ya da and ya da.
