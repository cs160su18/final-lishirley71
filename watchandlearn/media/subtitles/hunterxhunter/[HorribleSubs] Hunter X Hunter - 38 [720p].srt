00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,360
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,610
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,830
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,550
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,580
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,040
What's this?

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,730
Something Ging left with me.

11
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,770
Huh?

12
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,060
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,020
My dad left this for me...

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Reply x From x Dad

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,530
The box that had been sealed with Nen

16
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,530
contained three mysterious items.

17
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,930
One of them, an old cassette tape,

18
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,250
gave Gon his first chance

19
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,590
to hear his father's voice.

20
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,790
Yo, Gon...

21
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,700
So you became a Hunter, too.

22
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,550
This is my dad's voice.

23
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,680
Anyway, I have a question for you.

24
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,030
Do you want to see me?

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,820
If you do, keep on listening.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,510
If you don't, press the stop button.

27
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm guessing that's a "yes."

28
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,460
Then I'll ask you once more.

29
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,080
Are you prepared?

30
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,680
Hunters are selfish creatures.

31
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,470
They're willing to sacrifice
anything to get what they want.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,290
If you're only slightly interested in seeing me,

33
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,850
you should stop the tape now.

34
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,900
I'll give you a minute to consider it.

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,550
Well?

36
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,830
I guess you really do want to see me.

37
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,430
But I don't want to see you.

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,020
I don't know how I could face you now.

39
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,180
After all, I chose my own desires

40
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,710
over my parental duty.

41
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,970
I'm a bad person.

42
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm guessing that by the time
you hear this tape,

43
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,770
at least ten years will have passed.

44
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,850
But one thing still hasn't changed.

45
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,620
I'm still me.

46
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,730
Bo!

47
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,230
As you listen to this tape,

48
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm off doing reckless things.

49
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,810
If you want to see me, find me.

50
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,510
But as I said before, I don't want to see you.

51
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,320
If I sense you nearby,
I'll make myself scarce.

52
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,960
Catch me if you can.

53
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,820
You are a Hunter, aren't you?

54
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,550
Your dad isn't gonna be easy to track.

55
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,920
Oh, wait...

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,870
Ging's still there.

57
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, I forgot to mention something...

58
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,600
It's about your mother.

59
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,600
If you want to know more, keep listening.

60
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,370
If you're not interested...

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,800
Are you sure?

62
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,860
Yeah.

63
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,360
But he might have left you a clue.

64
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,170
I doubt it.

65
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,230
That's what my gut tells me.

66
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,370
Besides, I already told you...

67
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,000
My mom is Mito-san.

68
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,940
I see.

69
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,640
Are you hungry?

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,020
I'll go grab something.

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,990
Yeah.

72
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,500
Hey, Gon!

73
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,640
The tape started moving

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,790
all by itself!

75
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,600
What?!

76
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,940
There's aura around the tape player!

77
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,530
It's Nen...
Nen is rewinding the cassette!

78
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,250
Nen ?

79
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,030
Is he nearby?

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,120
No, he infused this player with
Nen over ten years ago!

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,770
So it would start rewinding,
once it was stopped!

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,870
Why?

83
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,040
Beats me.

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,670
Now it's recording!

85
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,560
I get it! He's erasing his message!

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,670
What?

87
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,100
It's not working!

88
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,530
I can't stop it...

89
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,620
Damn!

90
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,180
It still won't stop!

91
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,030
I pulled the plug!

92
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,170
Sorry, Gon.

93
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,570
I'll have to break it!

94
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,850
Damn!

95
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,900
No good!

96
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,550
There's Nen protecting the player!

97
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,330
It's finished.

98
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,230
Now it's recording!

99
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,680
I get it! He's erasing his message!

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,740
What?

101
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,480
The other tape was also wiped.

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,320
Why would he go to all this trouble?

103
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,340
I'm guessing he didn't want to leave any clues.

104
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,720
Clues?

105
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,940
You can extract a lot of information
from an audio clip.

106
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,830
Really?

107
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,870
You can determine the
speaker's height, weight,

108
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,710
gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases,

109
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,060
and state of mind.

110
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,560
From the background noise,
you can also determine the location.

111
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,820
But he was more worried
about something else.

112
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
Something else?

113
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,480
Nen.

114
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,930
I wouldn't be surprised if
there were a Nen user

115
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,410
somewhere who could analyze
data better than a machine.

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,410
Someone who would

117
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,550
know everything about a person
just from hearing their voice.

118
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,240
Oh, I get it.

119
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,750
Your dad's a tough nut.

120
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,160
Since the tape's useless now,

121
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,360
we only have two clues left...

122
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,460
The ring and the memory card.

123
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,980
I doubt the ring will help,

124
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,640
but the memory card could be important.

125
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,780
Yeah, it's smaller than a normal memory card.

126
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,640
Maybe you need a special machine to use it?

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Huh? You can't tell?

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,150
This memory card only works with the JS.

129
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,780
The JS?

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,810
A gaming console called the JoyStation.

131
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,150
It's three generations old.

132
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,280
You don't know anything, do you?

133
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,530
If this island still has tape players,
it probably has a console.

134
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,160
Is there a toy store here?

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,090
Yeah, there is.

136
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,800
Okay, hold on.

137
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
Oh, where are you going?

138
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,340
The toy store.

139
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,360
It's outside the port!

140
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
Got it!

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,760
Have a safe trip!

142
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,410
So this is a JoyStation...

143
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,530
This brings back memories.

144
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,140
I used to play with these all the time.

145
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,410
There were a bunch of hidden
gems for this console.

146
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,610
Then is this memory card
one of those hidden gems?

147
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,290
I don't see a title anywhere.

148
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,410
You've never played any video games, have you?

149
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,800
That's unusual.

150
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,920
Really?

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,870
That isn't a game disc.

152
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,290
It holds a game's memory data.

153
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,680
So you can't use it to play.

154
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,270
Yeah, you're supposed to
put the disc in here.

155
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,190
But if you insert the memory card and
power it on without a game inside,

156
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,550
you can see which games are using that memory.

157
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,960
Oh, really...

158
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,200
It looks like there's only one game saved on it.

159
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,260
It's called Greed Island.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,210
Greed Island?

161
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,490
Anyway, there are a bunch of saves.

162
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,710
I doubt it will do any good,
but I'll copy the data just in case.

163
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,780
Copying Greed Island.

164
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,470
Okay.

165
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,440
What are you doing?

166
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,530
Searching on-line.

167
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,250
We know the game's name.

168
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,140
So I'm looking for a store that sells it.

169
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,360
0 Matches

170
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,460
What?

171
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,370
Not a single match?

172
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,140
Does that mean it's out of print?

173
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,620
There aren't any used copies...

174
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,620
An out-of-print game would still have
some used copies floating around.

175
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,700
It's possible that this game isn't for sale.

176
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,880
What do you mean?

177
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,700
It could be an indie game

178
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,130
that was never for sale or was
banned for some reason.

179
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,010
Anyway, I'll keep searching.

180
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,300
There we go.

181
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,830
This game was sold through
legitimate channels.

182
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,520
"Greed Island.

183
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,750
A hunting game for Hunters."

184
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,200
For Hunters?

185
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,280
And what's with that price tag?!

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Five hundred, eighty million?

187
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,080
It's five billion, eight hundred million!

188
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,780
Huh?

189
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,460
That's ridiculous!

190
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,320
Only a hundred copies were produced.

191
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,070
That isn't very many.

192
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,760
It's practically nothing!

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,060
The developers were cocky...

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,290
The number is way too low!

195
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,500
But it makes sense.

196
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,020
The price is ridiculous,
but Hunters can afford it.

197
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,800
That explains how they sold out.

198
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,980
Do the makers have any left in stock?

199
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,990
Yeah, I guess we could ask.

200
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,050
The game you are inquiring about
is no longer in stock.

201
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,930
Unfortunately, there are no plans
to print additional copies.

202
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,740
I see, thanks.

203
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,510
That's a no-go.

204
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,810
I guess we'll have to find someone with
a copy and ask them to let us have it.

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,300
Yeah, our best bet is to advertise
on a reverse auction website

206
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,330
and wait for someone to offer to sell us a copy.

207
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,840
But where will we get the money?

208
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,210
If we pool our money from the arena,

209
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,110
that's eight hundred million.

210
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,200
Then we need another five billion...

211
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,630
Not necessarily.

212
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,600
Huh?

213
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,270
With these private deals,
the seller holds all the power.

214
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,620
Typically, they'll ask for more
than the original price.

215
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,720
So it'll cost even more?

216
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
Maybe.

217
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,220
Well, we can post a want ad, just in case.

218
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,370
Yeah, but I doubt anyone will click it.

219
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,500
"Looking for the game Greed Island...

220
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,700
Price negotiable."

221
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,650
Wh-What?

222
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,830
We already have over ten thousand hits!

223
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,090
So that's it...

224
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,650
They're trying to foist counterfeits off on us.

225
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,020
That should have been obvious,
considering the price.

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,850
This plan is a wash.

227
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,030
We can't examine every single offer.

228
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,080
Besides, we can't even tell
if it's the real game.

229
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Then what should we do?

230
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,080
If we dig more deeply on-line,
we might uncover more information.

231
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,920
But I'm not too familiar with that stuff.

232
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,180
Is there anyone who knows a bunch
about games and the Net?

233
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,860
Oh, there's someone who
knows a lot about both.

234
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,450
Huh?

235
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,060
He might even own a copy of Greed Island.

236
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,130
What? Really?

237
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,020
But I don't want to ask him...

238
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,440
Who is it?

239
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,040
Oh, Gotoh?

240
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,900
It's Killua.

241
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,880
Gotoh-san?

242
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,640
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

243
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,560
Right now?

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,940
Who cares where I am?

245
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,660
If I tell you, my mother might find out.

246
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,430
Anyway, put Piggy on.

247
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,190
Piggy?

248
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,320
What?

249
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,050
Killua wants to talk to me?

250
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,110
Screw that!

251
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,050
Tell him I'm not here.

252
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,440
Don't lie!

253
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,730
He never goes outside!

254
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,530
Tell him if he doesn't answer

255
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,560
the phone in ten seconds,
I'll break all his figures!

256
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,290
Fine, put him on.

257
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,430
Hey, Kil...

258
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,500
If you lay a finger on my
collection, I'll kill you!

259
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,410
I was just kidding, Bro.

260
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,320
You don't have to get so mad.

261
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,170
Bro?

262
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,220
Well? What is it?

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,210
I'm busy here.

264
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
Greed Island ?

265
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,740
Yeah, I've heard of it.

266
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,340
I never expected you to ask me
about a super-rare game.

267
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,950
You don't own a copy?

268
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,320
No, I don't.

269
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,370
I wanted one, but I was five
when the game went on sale.

270
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,100
So I didn't have any money.

271
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,940
There were over twenty thousand
requests for a hundred copies.

272
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,990
Even though each copy cost five billion,
eight hundred million Jenny in cash.

273
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,630
I tried looking around later,

274
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,290
but I couldn't even find an owner.

275
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a legendary game for all kinds of reasons.

276
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,680
So what's up?

277
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,070
Are you looking for a copy?

278
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,870
Pretty much.

279
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,740
It's impossible.

280
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,850
Forget it.

281
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,930
Even I had to give up.

282
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,970
Oh?

283
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,140
You gave up because it was
beyond your ability?

284
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,620
That was in the past.

285
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,230
I have a lead now.

286
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,900
But considering the amount
of effort and money,

287
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,650
it's not worth it.

288
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,980
Ah, so tell me this lead you have.

289
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,790
What? I won't tell you for free.

290
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,660
Will you trade for a Greed Island memory card?

291
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,750
What do you mean?

292
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,510
I happened to get my hands
on a memory card.

293
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,170
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?

294
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,270
Are you telling the truth?

295
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,520
I don't lie when I make deals.

296
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,470
Okay, I have two leads.

297
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,520
Hold on...

298
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,060
Don't say anything over the phone!

299
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,750
Don't worry.

300
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,060
This information

301
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,760
won't help anyone who
might be eavesdropping.

302
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,320
The first lead is...

303
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,870
Yeah.

304
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,940
Yeah, I see.

305
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,850
Okay, got it.

306
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,280
I'll send you the memory card
through the usual method.

307
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,920
Sorry.

308
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,390
I ended up trading the copy
of the memory card.

309
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,050
Sure, that's fine.

310
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,440
It's just a copy.

311
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,590
In return, I got two pieces
of solid information.

312
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,860
First, there's a website for Hunters,

313
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,180
only accessible by Hunters.

314
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,290
We can probably find leads
on Greed Island there.

315
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,270
Really?

316
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,720
I'll have to use my Hunter License.

317
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,340
Stupid!

318
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,200
If you use your home computer,
they'll know your address!

319
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,340
You'll have bad guys who want your
license showing up on the island!

320
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,860
Oh, that's right...

321
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,060
You have to use public computers
for this stuff...

322
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,240
In a hotel or a Net café.

323
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,330
Well, I still don't know the address.

324
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,750
My brother promised to tell me,
once he's received the memory card.

325
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,880
The second lead is the auction
in Yorknew City.

326
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,960
What?

327
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
Isn't Yorknew City...

328
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,420
Yes, the place where we're supposed
to meet Kurapika and Leorio.

329
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,520
In September, the city will host
the world's greatest auction.

330
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,470
My brother said it's probably a hoax,
but there's a rumor

331
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,690
that someone will distribute
dozens of copies at the auction.

332
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,530
Maybe that someone is Ging.

333
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,690
Yeah, that theory makes the
rumor more credible.

334
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,550
We'll need a crazy amount of
money to buy a copy.

335
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,500
That's right...

336
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,160
I guess it really was our destiny
to go to Yorknew City.

337
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,810
Battera, the tycoon, is offering
seventeen billion for the game,

338
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,560
and fifty billion for a memory card
with a complete saved game.

339
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,210
This is truly legendary.

340
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,210
Amusing.

341
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,720
I'm going to end this legend...

342
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,190
Wow...

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,880
There's so much food!

344
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,970
Is something special happening?

345
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,230
You won't be back for a while, right?

346
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,810
Mito-san...

347
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,680
Who knows when your next
chance to eat will be?

348
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,590
Fill up now.

349
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah!

350
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,590
Let's eat!

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,820
Mito-san!

352
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm going to find Ging!

353
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,780
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.

354
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,500
Take care of yourself until then!

355
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,310
Ging told Gon to find him,
leaving behind a riddle.

356
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,270
In order to solve that riddle
and meet his father,

357
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,740
Gon leaves his home again and heads
to Yorknew City with Killua.

358
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,610
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

359
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

360
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

361
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

362
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

363
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

364
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

365
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

366
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:19,670
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

367
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,390
Today, we introduce Ging!

368
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,840
I became a Hunter to find my dad.

369
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,830
Gon's dad,
a Double Star Hunter.

370
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,540
He left a message
box with Mito,

371
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,510
By the way, what does your dad want?

372
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm going to find my dad and ask him!

373
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,940
to give Gon after he
became a Hunter.

374
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,320
Next time: Wish x And x Promise!

375
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,340
Go to sleep, or you'll be late.

376
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,090
I don't need to sleep.

377
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,680
You should all get plenty of sleep.
