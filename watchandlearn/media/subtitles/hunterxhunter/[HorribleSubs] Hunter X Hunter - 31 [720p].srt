2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:11,490
Shroud

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,440
Ten.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,790
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:20,490
Null

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,830
Zetsu.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,190
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Enhance

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,110
Ren.

13
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,000
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,510
Act

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,160
Hatsu.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,200
The release of your Nen aura,

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,510
after boosting via Ren.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Four Major Principles

21
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,040
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,770
Master?

23
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,580
Master...

24
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,940
I may have

25
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,620
awakened an incredible beast...

26
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Destiny x And x Tenacity

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,200
One month has passed

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,370
since Gon was badly injured
in his match with Gido.

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,000
In Heavens Arena,

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,080
all eyes are focused on a
certain upcoming match.

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,760
Gon, I got something good...

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,420
Oh, Killua,

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,770
I was about to go looking for you.

34
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,960
Uh...

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
Are you really healed?

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,470
Yeah!

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,850
See? I'm perfectly fine!

38
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,410
Okay, I get it.

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,850
Those injuries should've kept him
out of action for four months,

40
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,160
but he recovered in a month.

41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,970
Man, what is your body made of?

42
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,360
How to answer that...

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,200
You're weird.

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,930
Well?

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,820
Weren't you about to say something?

46
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,670
Oh, here.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,430
Tickets?

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,930
These aren't just tickets.

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,380
They're for Hisoka's fight.

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,690
As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets.

51
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,990
The tickets to Hisoka's match
are a really hot item.

52
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,840
There are even scalpers hawking them.

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,440
Oh...

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,110
So I've been gathering information.

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,710
It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.

56
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,350
He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's.

57
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,800
Each KO has led to death.

58
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,880
But he's lost three matches...

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,700
His three losses were due to forfeits.

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,360
Forfeits?

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,550
He reached the registration deadline,

62
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,300
so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show.

63
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,890
Which means...

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,890
If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose.

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,890
Yeah.

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,590
And he's only given up a total of four points.

67
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,760
One knockdown, three clean hits.

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,830
He's as strong as a Floor Master.

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,990
I'm in trouble...

70
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,160
Jeez.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,170
You don't look like someone who
thinks they're in trouble.

72
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,670
So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.

73
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,150
Two years ago, he claimed the sole
knockdown against Hisoka.

74
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,740
And of the four points scored against Hisoka,

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,850
he's responsible for three.

76
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,800
He scored three points against Hisoka...

77
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,520
You could say they have a history.

78
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,060
Apparently, they both registered for the
same day so they could fight each other.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,440
You should have the chance to
analyze Hisoka's fighting style.

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,510
Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.

81
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,410
But is this okay?

82
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,540
I promised Wing-san...

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,090
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!

84
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,750
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, Nen.

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,230
Of course it's okay!

86
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,560
You'll just be watching a match.

87
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,560
It is not okay!

88
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,890
Viewing a match counts as learning about Nen.

89
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,730
W-Wing-san...

90
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,320
Don't scare us.

91
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,070
Gon-kun,

92
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,460
has your arm healed?

93
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,950
Y-Yes! It's fine now.

94
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,330
He has unbelievable regenerative powers.

95
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,560
Since he's recovered, he can
watch the match, right?

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,840
No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months.

97
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,570
Gon-kun, you should spend one more month

98
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,970
practicing "Ten," and recovering
from your injuries.

99
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,870
Oh...

100
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,920
Okay, I understand.

101
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,600
Well,

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,170
then it's fine.

103
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,980
Osu! Take care.

104
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,120
Oh, well...

105
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,320
You'll have to watch a recording,

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,170
so I'll go and see it in person.

107
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,490
He's kept his promise.

108
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,120
He's only practiced "Ten" each day.

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,270
I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him

110
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,620
under normal circumstances.

111
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Their auras flow like serene rivers.

112
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,230
Master?

113
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,050
Hmm?

114
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,150
Oh, never mind...

115
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,630
It's nothing.

116
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,760
This won't do...

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,890
I'm the one who's losing control.

118
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,900
Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,450
Today in Heavens Arena,
we have Kastro versus Hisoka,

120
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,050
the match you've all been waiting for!

121
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,500
Just look at this crowd!

122
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,550
The match doesn't start for another hour,

123
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,950
but the arena is already packed!

124
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,760
This is a promise thread.

125
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,390
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.

126
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,790
Two years ago, Hisoka was
the winner of their match.

127
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,850
The audience is fired up to
watch this match of destiny,

128
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,980
as Kastro looks for revenge!

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,550
Sporting an 8-3 record, with all three losses

130
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,490
being forfeits due to absence,

131
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,410
we have the deadly magician with the
tendency toward absence, Hisoka!

132
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,400
And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record,

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,190
one win away from the Floor Masters after
nine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka,

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,610
we have the martial artist, Kastro!

135
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,570
Will he avenge his earlier loss,
as he's predicted?

136
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,260
Get ready for a battle between the two fighters

137
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,860
nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!

138
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,360
Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,520
Next up, we have an interview with
Kastro, from a few days ago.

140
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,480
I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.

141
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
You'll see that I'm not the same
person I was two years ago.

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,670
Oh, he sounds confident...

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,230
We'll see if he can back it up.

144
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,130
Wh-What?

145
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,010
There he is.

146
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,780
Was there something you needed?

147
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,280
What?

148
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,530
R-Ridiculous.

149
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,530
He was just sitting on the couch...

150
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,540
When did he move?

151
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,110
Did he open the door and slip behind me,

152
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,090
without catching my attention?

153
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,550
No, that's impossible!

154
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,490
I never took my eyes off the door

155
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,010
until after he spoke.

156
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,060
He never had the chance.

157
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,310
How did he do this?

158
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,970
W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph.

159
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,810
From me?

160
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,560
You honor me,

161
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,950
Killua-kun.

162
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,790
I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.

163
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,930
You're not with Gon?

164
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,850
Oh, so you do know everything.

165
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,150
Are you here to scout an opponent?

166
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,000
Nope,

167
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,500
I just wanted a closer look.

168
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,750
And what do you think?

169
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,760
You're pretty damn good.

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,990
Thank you.

171
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,120
Your Zetsu was quite impressive.

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,530
However, you should have

173
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,510
concealed your presence
before reaching this floor.

174
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,330
When an aura as strong as yours disappears,

175
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,810
that would put most of us on alert.

176
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,270
You've been following up on me
since I reached this floor?

177
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,510
Pretty much.

178
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,240
Then I want to know...

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,160
How did you do that just now?

180
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,700
Unfortunately, I can't tell you.

181
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,910
After all, I might have to fight you someday.

182
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,660
Don't worry.

183
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,120
I'm not interested in fighting here again.

184
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,170
Really?

185
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,830
That isn't what your aura says.

186
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,410
That was a joke.

187
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,570
I'll answer your question when we fight.

188
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,300
I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.

189
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm sure you can get there.

190
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,810
I told you I'm not interested in fighting!

191
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,830
Yes, it's finally time...

192
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,330
The long-awaited rematch between
Hisoka and Kastro!

193
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,170
I'm very grateful, Hisoka.

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,730
If not for the initiation you gave me back then,

195
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,840
I'd never have become this strong.

196
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,590
You mean to imply that you're stronger now?

197
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,190
Just so you're aware,

198
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,630
I never used my full strength

199
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,100
in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.

200
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,930
Those matches were nothing more

201
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,110
than a warm-up for my defeat of you.

202
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,730
Begin!

203
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,530
Here I come!

204
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,660
A clean hit!

205
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,150
Kastro has landed the first strike!

206
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,280
What was that?

207
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,460
Give me your best shot, Hisoka.

208
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,600
Kastro is the one to land the first strike!

209
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,520
Hisoka has surrendered the first point,

210
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,600
after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,550
Again... An illusion?

212
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm not the same person I was two years ago.

213
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,990
I won't hold back on my next attack.

214
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,420
You'll have my best shot when
I deem it necessary.

215
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,580
Very well.

216
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,310
Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.

217
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,440
Again...

218
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,600
I was sure he dodged that!

219
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,270
What's wrong?

220
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,410
Will you just run around, rather than attack?

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,020
Clean hit! And knockdown!

222
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,890
What an amazing start!

223
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,640
Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!

224
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,970
The score is now 4-0.

225
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,100
However, are my eyes deceiving me?

226
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,150
Have you still not changed your mind?

227
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,900
Would you prefer to die ignorant?

228
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,410
C-Can you fight?

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,420
If I am not mistaken,

230
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,800
you seemed to disappear...

231
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,470
That's right!

232
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,850
He disappeared!

233
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,680
That's what I saw!

234
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,510
No,

235
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,680
that is not an accurate description.

236
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,480
You were readying a kick from the front,

237
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,940
when suddenly, you were behind me.

238
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,960
I suppose that would be more precise.

239
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,320
But that doesn't sound right...

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Something is off.

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,700
Yes,

242
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,330
I feel I'm missing something very basic here...

243
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,700
It's futile.

244
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,340
If you continue to run in circles,
you'll never learn the truth.

245
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,720
Because I'm done waiting.

246
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,590
I'll take your arm with my next strike.

247
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,600
If you still will not attack,

248
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,710
then so be it.

249
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,450
It seems you weren't good enough.

250
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,280
Tiger Bite Fist

251
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,020
He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!

252
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,030
Kastro's getting serious!

253
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,660
Tiger Bite Fist?

254
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,380
That technique

255
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,970
can split a tree in two, when used by a master.

256
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,380
Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't
figured out Kastro's ability.

257
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,050
Well, I don't really understand it, either.

258
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,550
At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!

259
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,930
Here I come!

260
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,060
Go ahead and take it.

261
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,570
Not worried, huh?

262
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,520
Or is this meant to be a trap?

263
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,570
Either way,

264
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,820
I'll take your arm!

265
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,530
Your other one.

266
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,240
Hisoka's arm!

267
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,020
Hisoka's right arm has been severed!

268
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,720
You shouldn't assume that
I'll act the way you want.

269
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,720
This was just part of the plan.

270
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,240
What crap.

271
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,470
Have we ever seen Hisoka in
such a perilous situation?

272
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,800
He's taken considerable damage!

273
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,380
I understand.

274
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,490
Your ability is, in fact,

275
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,120
a double.

276
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,350
Impressive.

277
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,620
You are correct.

278
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,320
A double?

279
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,880
What does he mean?

280
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,020
Then it wasn't an illusion!

281
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,990
When Kastro attacked,

282
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,730
there really were two of him.

283
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,060
What is going on here?

284
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,200
Kastro has split into two?

285
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,780
Cloned himself?

286
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,200
Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!

287
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,050
Does he actually have a twin?!

288
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,960
Is this your doppelganger?

289
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,520
Indeed.

290
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,560
Doppelganger?

291
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,970
Yes.

292
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,350
Master, what does that mean?

293
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,100
It refers to a double, as in an additional you.

294
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,930
When you spot someone who resembles you,

295
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,420
that's called a doppelganger.

296
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,860
Er, I don't get it...

297
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,280
When you encounter a doppelganger,

298
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,460
you experience headaches and fatigue,

299
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,300
which continue until your double is destroyed.

300
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,030
Some believe that the double

301
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,100
takes energy from the original.

302
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,990
B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.

303
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,580
He's really strong.

304
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
That's only a story.

305
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,760
Besides, he mastered this
ability through training.

306
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,650
I listened to your warning,

307
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,860
and I watched carefully, rather than run.

308
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,110
And it turns out my deduction that
you disappeared was correct.

309
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,590
So why did I question that description?

310
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,670
That's because

311
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,340
I still sensed your presence beside me.

312
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
In fact, right before you disappeared,

313
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,220
I felt a new presence.

314
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,140
You duplicate yourself before disappearing.

315
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,890
I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.

316
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,650
I was able to successfully create a double with Nen.

317
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,960
My double goes on the attack,

318
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,400
while I hide in the shadows.

319
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,070
As soon as you react,

320
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,910
I dismiss my double, and attack.

321
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,260
So those fluttering clothes were
meant to help him hide.

322
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,770
The most skilled Nen user would still experience

323
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,020
difficulty in figuring out
this trick, while in combat.

324
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,670
Naturally,

325
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,720
my double is no mere illusion.

326
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,680
It exists as a second me until I send it away.

327
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,690
You know this after suffering
an attack from my double.

328
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,940
In other words, you must fight both of my selves.

329
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,400
This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
completed through the mastery of Nen.

330
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,410
I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!

331
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,410
True Tiger Bite Fist

332
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,100
Incredible! We have an
upset in the making!

333
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,620
Hisoka, the winner two years ago,
is in deep trouble!

334
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,140
Will Kastro be able to avenge
his previous defeat?

335
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,800
Next, I will take your left arm.

336
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,430
Will you continue to act disinterested?

337
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,170
Hmm, let's see...

338
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,710
I think I have a little motivation now.

339
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,450
The fearsome double-user, Kastro,

340
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,200
and the magician, Hisoka.

341
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Their incredible battle will have
an unthinkable end,

342
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,210
but Gon knows nothing of all this yet.

343
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

344
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

345
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,860
Coming up, we have Gon

346
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

347
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

348
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,740
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

349
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,470
It's Gon

350
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,320
and Killua's

351
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

352
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:18,460
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

353
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,750
Today, we introduce Riehlvelt.

354
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,830
A 200s class warrior.

355
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,660
He uses his aura to move his wheelchair.

356
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,500
Fights with Nen and his
custom wheelchair
and dual whips.

357
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,270
He fights with two whips.

358
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,720
There's probably a secret behind them.

359
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,870
Whippie.

360
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,950
Next time: A x Surprising x Win!

361
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,050
Gon, if you could clone yourself,

362
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,190
what would you do?

363
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,550
Play rock-paper-scissors with myself!

364
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,300
Wouldn't you always end up tying?
