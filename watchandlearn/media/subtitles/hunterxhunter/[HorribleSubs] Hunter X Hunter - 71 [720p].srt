2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,730
We will now resume the match.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,240
Razor's Nen beasts...

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,740
Are vanishing.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,700
He drew the aura he'd
dispersed back into himself.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
So his next throw will use his true strength.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,050
Bargain x And x Deal

8
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
The match begins once again.

9
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,310
What is Gon's plan to retake the ball from Razor?

10
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,030
I didn't expect I'd need to use this...

11
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,280
It's been a long time

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,320
since I've felt this good!

13
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,020
He threw the ball straight up?

14
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,070
Does that mean...

15
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,990
He's going for a spike?

16
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,180
Hey, over there.

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
They're literally going to...

18
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,940
Combine!

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,090
I see what you're attempting.

20
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,800
Then it's a contest to determine

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,760
the winner!

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,730
Their plan is

23
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,730
for Gon to catch the ball.

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,730
For Hisoka to smother it...

25
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,740
And for Killua to provide support!

26
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,410
They did it!

27
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,150
They stopped it!

28
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,300
Way to go!

29
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,810
I have to applaud them for that.

30
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,800
They overcame my power using their wits.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,060
And the key to their success

32
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,440
was that boy Killua.

33
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,840
Gon focused aura on his
hands to catch the ball.

34
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,870
The incredible concentration and focus
it took to pull that off deserve my praise.

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,430
The moment Gon caught it,

36
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,110
Hisoka used his power to smother the ball's
momentum so Gon wouldn't drop it.

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,880
Had his technique been less than perfect,

38
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,560
the ball would have flown off.

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,970
And Killua...

40
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,520
He was stuck between them,
acting as both a cushion and a brace,

41
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,910
balancing his aura between
offensive and defensive.

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
If the aura around his body had been too weak,

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,010
he would have failed to work as a cushion,

44
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,240
and all three of them would have taken
major damage from the ball's impact.

45
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,870
But if he hadn't used enough aura on his legs,

46
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,900
he would have failed to act as a
brace, and the ball would have

47
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,000
knocked all three of them outside the court.

48
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,740
He needed to analyze how to balance

49
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,080
his aura between body and legs
within one-percent accuracy.

50
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,840
A feat that demanded both experience and talent.

51
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,280
But Killua managed to compensate for
his inexperience with his prodigious talent,

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,420
allowing him to overcome such a difficult task.

53
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,770
His talent is scary.

54
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,550
I didn't reach that point until
I was in my late twenties...

55
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,240
I have to beat them before they can combine.

56
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,230
Right after their attack, my chance will come.

57
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,710
If I can get them at that moment,
they won't have time to combine.

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,960
Certainly, Gon's throw is powerful,

59
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,550
but now I have the power to catch
it without being pushed back.

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,100
Then I can pick them off one at a time.

61
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,430
I need more power...

62
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,840
More...

63
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,480
More!

64
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,370
He didn't use his full strength earlier?

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,380
Unbelievable...

66
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,950
He's a monster.

67
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,390
Ging, you should be happy.

68
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,000
This kid is definitely your son.

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,020
Killua, I'm going all-out.

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,690
You'd better!

71
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,650
If you don't, I'll smack you!

72
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,030
First comes rock!

73
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,160
Rock,

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
paper...

75
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,690
Rock!

76
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,890
More powerful than anticipated.

77
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,840
But I can catch it!

78
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,180
However, the momentum

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,150
will force me out of bounds!

80
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,050
So catching isn't an option,

81
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,350
but I can't dodge, either!

82
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,410
Come...

83
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,510
Trying to receive it again?

84
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,490
Fool, that'll let Hisoka grab it!

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,740
I wouldn't be so sure...

86
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,150
That depends on

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,170
the direction in which I direct it!

88
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,310
He bounced it back!

89
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,960
Gon, dodge!

90
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,960
You'll still win!

91
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,840
No, he won't dodge.

92
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,590
That isn't how he wants to win.

93
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,850
During this match, I've learned
that much about him.

94
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,430
He's unconscious?

95
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,130
Oh, right.

96
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,920
It was the aura he expended...

97
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,200
He truly used every ounce of strength.

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,070
You can take pride in this.

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,450
You've won, Gon.

100
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,950
Not quite yet.

101
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,460
Why would you do that?!

102
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,710
He desired total victory.
Right, Gon?

103
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,480
He bounced it back again!

104
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,090
Interesting.

105
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,850
Are we just rallying now?

106
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,960
It'll come down to stamina!

107
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,110
The ball is stuck...

108
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,120
Bungee Gum possesses the properties
of both rubber and gum.

109
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,850
Razor, catching the ball while touching the
area out of bounds is against the rules.

110
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,140
You're out!

111
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,140
Which makes Team Gon
the winner of this match!

112
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
All right!

113
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,940
That was amazing, guys!

114
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,670
Huh?

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
What happened at the end?

116
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,150
They beat me good...

117
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,450
Oh, so Hisoka finished the job.

118
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,660
In the end, he stole all the glory.

119
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,500
It was only possible with all of your help.

120
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,660
Call this a victory for the team.

121
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,510
That doesn't sound like you at all.

122
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,170
You beat me.

123
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,490
As promised, we'll leave the city.

124
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,170
Oh, yeah...

125
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,320
That was this game's purpose.

126
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
But first,

127
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,560
I will answer your question about Ging.

128
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,070
Ow!

129
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,810
Honestly, you were so reckless!

130
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,810
Your hands are a total mess.

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Hey, are you listening?

132
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,930
The answer is that Ging isn't here.

133
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,930
Nor do I know where he is.

134
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,160
Oh...

135
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,580
Well, I was expecting that.

136
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,510
But I can tell you some stories that I know.

137
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,840
Yes, please!

138
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,710
I, too, was a death row convict.

139
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,190
I was a murderer.

140
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,780
I'd been arrested, jailed, and sentenced to die,

141
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,770
when Ging hired me to come here.

142
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,920
Ging taught me it took only one person,

143
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,700
one person in the entire world who will trust you,

144
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,490
to save you.

145
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,930
My son will come here one day.

146
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,590
When that happens, give him a good beating.

147
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,130
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?

148
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,480
Don't get too cocky.

149
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,260
He is my son.

150
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,370
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

151
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,500
I always thought your old man was insane.

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,980
He'd spend hours with a death
row convict going on and on

153
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,020
about a game he made, like a kid would.

154
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,770
And then he hired that convict
to fight his own son.

155
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,650
Scum! Who do you think is letting you live?

156
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,120
Hey...

157
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,010
You!

158
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,050
Over there!

159
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,650
Oh, that...

160
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,030
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.

161
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,800
It felt like no one had ever
called me by name before.

162
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,010
Ging believed in your strength,
so he left you to me.

163
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,760
And I believed in your strength,

164
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,310
which is why I didn't hold back.

165
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,760
Yeah, but I couldn't have won
without everyone else.

166
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,130
That was some good teamwork.

167
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,010
Yeah.

168
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,650
Gon, go find Ging.

169
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,890
Yep!

170
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,910
This is the place.

171
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,950
A window?

172
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,170
We can see the shore from here.

173
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,960
How do we reach the Sea God's Grotto from here?

174
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,140
Directly below the point on the
surface the light points to.

175
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,860
There's a grotto down there.

176
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,440
But there isn't any treasure there.

177
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,820
I'm sorry I deceived you.

178
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,430
Really?

179
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,950
It's a sacred cavern,

180
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,340
so only a few fishermen know the location.

181
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,520
All other stories you heard were
rumors made up by others.

182
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,640
Including the stories of treasure.

183
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,310
But Razor and his gang wouldn't believe us.

184
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,380
Those who make their living on
the sea can never defile it.

185
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,230
So they said before they were all killed,
taking the secret with them.

186
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,230
Hey...

187
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,740
You get that this is a story in a game, right?

188
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,280
I can finally see the ocean again from here.

189
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
The sunrise...

190
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,840
The boats returning with their hauls...

191
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,800
The water sparkling in many colors.

192
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,410
In my mind, this view is the true treasure.

193
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,930
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.

194
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,440
Yes! We got Patch of Shore!

195
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,930
Let's use Clone to make two copies.

196
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,680
We're fine with taking the copies.

197
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,940
Yes, you've earned the right to the original.

198
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,210
Hisoka, you really don't want anything?

199
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,350
No, it was quite fun.

200
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,820
Why don't you join us?

201
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,700
I'm curious about the Troupe's actions.

202
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,980
I'm not interested in collecting cards.

203
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,800
Should anything else come up,
use Contact to reach me.

204
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,710
I'll use Accompany or Magnetic
Force to come at once.

205
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,090
Huh?

206
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,480
That liar!

207
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,140
Huh?

208
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,730
We haven't used Magnetic Force
at all since Hisoka joined, right?

209
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,920
That means he already knew about
spell cards before he ran into us!

210
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,480
Killua,

211
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,190
there are liars who only lie
when there's a reason to,

212
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,480
and there are liars who also lie without reason.

213
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,350
You and I are the former.

214
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,740
He is the latter.

215
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,940
You won't get anywhere by fretting over it.

216
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,500
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

217
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,240
It's been a while.

218
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,010
Do you know who this is?

219
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,380
Genthru?

220
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,090
What do you want?

221
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,750
First, I'd like to congratulate you.

222
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,080
What are you talking about?

223
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,140
Don't bother playing dumb.

224
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,480
I promise to spare your lives.

225
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,150
In return, hand over Patch of Shore.

226
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,860
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Well, I am somewhat interested
to see if you can beat us.

228
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,900
If you're willing to deal,

229
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,520
come alone to Masadora's entrance in one hour.

230
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,290
If you don't, we'll take the card by force.

231
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,260
You cannot escape us.

232
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,170
We have many copies of Accompany.

233
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,780
How?

234
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,450
I knew he'd find out, but not this soon!

235
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,180
Asta, Amana, Manheim,

236
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,250
Nick Cue, Souheil, Kazsule...

237
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,070
They were all members of
your party of fifteen.

238
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,940
Isn't that right?

239
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,900
Check your Binder.

240
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,700
They're no longer with us.

241
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,380
Book!

242
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,420
This means they're either dead
or no longer in the game...

243
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,670
Genthru!

244
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,740
Who are you?

245
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,300
Gon Freecss!

246
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,960
I'll take you on!

247
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,560
Gon?

248
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,580
So you're one of those three kids.

249
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,850
It appears you have Lucky Alexandrite.

250
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,580
Once I'm done with Tsezgerra, I'll come for you.

251
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,200
Or do you want to give up the card now?

252
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,940
You come here this instant!

253
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,290
I'll fight you!

254
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,860
I also have—

255
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,530
Tsezgerra, can you move somewhere else?

256
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,120
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,120
This is Phinks.

258
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,960
We found him.

259
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,010
I'm heading your way.

260
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,520
Wouldn't it be faster to target the kids?

261
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,180
They probably have a copy of Patch of Shore.

262
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,380
But it would be a card created by Clone.

263
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,980
That's true.

264
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,530
Once those kids see Tsezgerra
surrender, they'll give up.

265
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,150
If we go after the kids first,

266
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,470
Tsezgerra will have time to recover,
and that will just give us more trouble.

267
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,250
He is a Single Star Hunter.

268
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,510
And we don't know what his power is.

269
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,920
Genthru doesn't know your strength.

270
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,920
So he believes that we are carrying
the original Patch of Shore.

271
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,170
They want the original card...
they want "our" card.

272
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,470
We'll try to buy as much time as possible.

273
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,430
Use the time to regain your strength.

274
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,930
If you want to beat this game, you'll
have no choice but to fight them.

275
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,190
And you are the only ones
with a chance to win.

276
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,850
But, Gon...

277
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,440
Just now, your actions were
both selfish and foolish.

278
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,360
If they'd accepted your challenge and come,

279
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,920
what would have happened
to Killua, given his injuries?

280
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,650
You endangered not only yourself,

281
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,280
but your friends too, by losing
control of your emotions!

282
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,440
Very well.

284
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,470
It will all come down to Accompany.

285
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,970
If we evade their use of Accompany,
we should be able to buy plenty of time.

286
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,890
But if too much time passes,

287
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,310
they may decide to switch and target you.

288
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,830
I estimate we have a one-week limit.

289
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,360
Past that, we can't make guarantees.

290
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,150
One week...

291
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,530
That isn't long.

292
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,400
And that's probably optimistic.

293
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,000
They may well switch to us after three days.

294
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,340
I'll go with Tsezgerra.

295
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
What about you guys?

296
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,330
If we're buying you time,
that implies we have an alliance.

297
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,380
No, wait.

298
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,830
There is little benefit from an alliance with them.

299
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,130
The enemy already knows the
eight of us have teamed up.

300
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,890
So we won't be able to act as decoys
while you take out Genthru.

301
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,280
That means leaving the original versions

302
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,080
of the last two cards they seek,

303
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,030
#2 and #75, with any one
party would be dangerous.

304
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,980
So my offer to buy time isn't an alliance.

305
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,230
I'm offering a deal.

306
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,780
A deal?

307
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,310
Three weeks...

308
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,770
That's the amount of time we can buy.

309
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,680
If we succeed, will you give
us #75, Lucky Alexandrite?

310
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,560
That doesn't make sense.

311
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,050
You just said one week was the limit.

312
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,300
That's assuming we stay on the run.

313
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,570
If necessary, I can force a stalemate of sorts.

314
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,910
I see.

315
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,940
But for #75, we could just
tell you how to obtain it.

316
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,960
No, we already know how.

317
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,140
But Goreinu and the rest of us

318
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,940
have few empty slots left.

319
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,510
It's no longer reasonable to turn
all our cards over to the villagers.

320
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,770
Three weeks.

321
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,320
That isn't enough time for
Killua's hands to heal.

322
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,590
And it certainly isn't enough to close the
gap between Genthru's abilities and ours.

323
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,090
Which means we should use the
time to come up with a plan.

324
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,500
Exactly.

325
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,630
Devise a scenario in which
you can defeat Genthru.

326
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,730
Identify the required circumstances,
and prepare to carry out that plan.

327
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,230
Got it.

328
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,490
Good...

329
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,830
We'll leave to delay Team Genthru now.

330
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
Keep this in mind, Gon...

331
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,490
They've already killed over
fifty players in this game.

332
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,000
If you want to beat the game,
you'll have to fight them.

333
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,540
Accompany on!

334
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,630
To Masadora!

335
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,190
Three weeks... That isn't much time.

336
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,790
Killua, you focus on healing

337
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,440
and thinking of a plan to defeat Genthru.

338
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,220
Right.

339
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,280
Gon, you train with me.

340
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,830
The first necessity is that you be
able to avoid his Little Flower.

341
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,650
Osu!

342
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,200
Gon has won his match against Razor.

343
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,320
But the bombers remain stronger
fighters than Gon's group.

344
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,680
Will they be able to devise a viable plan?

345
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,210
G.I. Tutorial

346
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,860
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

347
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,550
Today, we introduce the card Clone.

348
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,570
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]

349
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,990
It transforms into one

350
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,020
random card from the player's restricted slots.

351
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,760
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net 500G.
Very shy and quiet.

352
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,180
Wow, Gold Dust Girl!

353
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,820
Gain!

354
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

355
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,220
Next time: Chase x And x Chance.

356
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,410
Battera!

357
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,340
Sabazushi!

358
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,230
Battera.

359
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,080
Barazushi.

360
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,450
Zushi, Zushi, osu!
