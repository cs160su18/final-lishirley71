2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,480
There he is.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,720
That's your target.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,740
The tycoon, Mr. Battera.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,290
Objective?

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,330
That would be Greed Island, of course.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,250
Why are you so interested in a game?

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,250
You've spent a considerable
amount on it by now.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,250
It is an expression of love.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,580
Isn't wanting to monopolize
that which you love natural?

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,980
What is this love you mention?

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,510
There are many rumors flying around.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,690
Any comments?

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,440
I will get my hands on the clue Ging left!

15
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Bid x And x Haste

16
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,110
What time is it?

17
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,560
Kurapika!

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,470
It's 2:00 PM.

19
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,560
I slept for half a day?

20
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,950
It's been two whole days, Kurapika...

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,250
Where's the boss?

22
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,920
What about the underground auction?

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
It ended up being canceled.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,850
The rest of the merchandise
will be auctioned online.

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,340
The boss accepted that.

26
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,060
You're lying.

27
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,310
Eh?

28
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,940
She was looking forward to
taking part in the auction.

29
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,220
I don't see her accepting that so easily...

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,700
Squala was killed.

31
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,200
And Eliza was inconsolable...

32
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,320
The Scarlet Eyes we won were stolen.

33
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,580
But apparently,

34
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,010
the boss was severely shocked by Eliza's state.

35
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,960
That was when she said
she wanted to go home.

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,490
I see.

37
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,440
What about Gon and Killua?

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,100
They're both fine.

39
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,120
Around now...

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,310
He fell asleep.

41
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,350
They're doing what they need to do,

42
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,860
so you should get plenty of rest.

43
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,620
Our next item

44
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
is the legendary game,

45
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,660
Greed Island !

46
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,980
Let's take a look at the mysterious
power this game contains.

47
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,510
As you can see, there is a mysterious power

48
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,900
that protects the console from any damage,

49
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,160
as long as someone is playing inside.

50
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,030
This man is Jeitsari.

51
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,660
He is a player who's inside
the game at this moment.

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,190
In fact, he's the one who signed a contract

53
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,920
allowing us to auction it off.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,760
So this copy wasn't brought here by Ging.

55
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,930
Jeitsari left behind the following agreement:

56
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,990
"If we cannot clear this game

57
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,440
before the date specified in the contract,

58
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,420
seven active players, including myself,

59
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,110
will present seven copies
of the game and console

60
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,020
to the Southern Piece Auction,
so our talented young Hunters

61
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,450
can clear the game and fulfill our dream."

62
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,430
Unfortunately, when we
obtained these copies,

63
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,210
two already displayed game over screens.

64
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,280
That means the players also died in real life.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,810
This dangerous game requires
that you risk your own life!

66
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,720
Make sure you're prepared before you bid.

67
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,190
Let's start the bidding at 900 million Jenny!

68
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,490
I have 1 billion!

69
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,840
I have 1.5 billion!

70
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,170
#105 doubles it to 3 billion.

71
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,160
#71 doubles it again...

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,330
to 6 billion!

73
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,360
Hey! That's my brother!

74
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,460
So you indicate how much
you're bidding with your hand?

75
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,320
Yeah,

76
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,870
the auctioneer is able to
instantly discern the highest bid.

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,120
#16 doubles it again...

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,970
to 12 billion!

79
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,160
What's this?

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,320
#201 doubles it again,

81
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,640
to 24 billion!

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
You idiot!

83
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,750
#16 bids 25 billion!

84
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,260
Whew, that was close...

85
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm guessing he wasn't able to
decipher that memory card.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,520
#71 bids 25.5 billion...

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,020
How much money does he have?

88
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,790
#16 goes all the way up to 30.5 billion!

89
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,280
Damn it!

90
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,290
30.5 billion, huh?

91
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,790
No matter...

92
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,600
If we can clear this game.

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,420
Um, we're Hunters.

94
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,920
We're willing to help clear Greed Island.

95
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,810
Don't joke around. Go on home.

96
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,000
We're not joking! I'm a pro Hunter.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,310
What nonsense.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,060
Do you have a license?

99
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,130
Yes!

100
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,460
Uh, you don't.

101
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,440
It's at the pawn shop.

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,250
Oh.

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,070
Uh, it's not on me...

104
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,830
See... He's lying.

105
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm not lying!

106
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,890
Hold on...

107
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,710
The fact that you're here means
you're certainly not ordinary.

108
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,590
However, I can't blindly
accept everything you say.

109
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,090
I am indeed looking to hire
Hunters in order to clear this game,

110
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,250
but I cannot hire you at this time.

111
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,600
Because there can only be so many players.

112
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,450
Crap...

113
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,040
Has our plan failed?

114
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm thinking that we don't
need to buy the game.

115
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,610
We just want the data inside it.

116
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,630
And I bet some of the people
who win copies of Greed Island

117
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,740
will be looking for players, too.

118
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,990
There can only be so many players?

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
Each memory card only has the
capacity to store one player's data.

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,490
With multitaps, you can have a
maximum of eight players per console.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,010
Oh, right.

122
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,560
That Greed Island save used up

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,740
all thirty blocks on that memory card.

124
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,260
Yeah.

125
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,990
How did you know that?!

126
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,640
We have a Greed Island save file.

127
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,560
Have you played the game before?

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,270
No, we only have a memory card.

129
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Does that mean...

130
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,930
If that memory card is real,

131
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,280
you would need another item to remove the card

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,200
from the console.

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,290
Would that be...

134
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,040
The ring?

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,520
They know about the ring, too.

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,720
It appears that they are worthy of consideration.

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,740
I assume that you can use Nen.

138
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,180
Show me your Ren.

139
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,050
Sure!

140
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,530
Well?

141
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,480
It's hopeless.

142
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,440
Letting them play would be a waste of time.

143
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,320
They'd run around in circles until they died.

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,900
How can you be certain when we haven't tried?!

145
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,880
It'll be too late once you're in the game, kid.

146
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,330
Unless you die off immediately.

147
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,710
We don't need people who'll
drag out the inevitable.

148
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,210
As long as a player is alive inside the game,

149
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,060
you can't reset or remove the memory card.

150
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,180
In other words, you can't send in new players.

151
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,920
I've hired around one hundred

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,060
pro and amateur Hunters to play this game,

153
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,100
and over half of them have given up.

154
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,360
Given up?

155
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,970
They've given up on returning to the real world,

156
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,150
choosing to live inside the game.

157
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,870
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.

158
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,360
We need people

159
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,060
who are strong enough to obtain items

160
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,940
for returning to the real world.

161
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,500
And you're saying we aren't strong enough?

162
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,630
How can he know that?

163
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,930
Because he's a pro Hunter who
has played Greed Island before.

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Speaking from my own experience,

165
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,580
the items for returning to the real
world are relatively easy to obtain.

166
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,340
But with your Nen, it's hopeless.

167
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,400
In fact, it'd be game over in no time.

168
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,330
Once the screening is done,
I'm returning to the game.

169
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,420
Screening?

170
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,490
You're screening players?

171
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,910
Yes, the screening will be
on the auction's final day.

172
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,100
If you're interested in participating,

173
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,920
you'll need to work on your Nen.

174
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,160
We were going to do that anyway!

175
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,670
Let's go, Killua!

176
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,660
Before you go, kid...

177
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,110
How did you come by a memory card?

178
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,430
I'm not telling you!

179
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,430
Damn it... I'm mad now.

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,050
We absolutely must pass their screening!

181
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,270
Screening...

182
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,420
What's the plan?

183
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,040
You even need to ask?

184
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,700
We're bandits.

185
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,470
We steal.

186
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,260
Let's return to the base and play.

187
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,130
A memory card is already inserted,

188
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,790
so only one more can play.

189
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,140
We can use a multitap.

190
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,320
Four more can play now.

191
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,270
Nice...

192
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,330
So who goes first?

193
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,650
I'll go first.

194
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
Whoa...

195
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,410
He really did disappear.

196
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,970
I was kind of skeptical...

197
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,660
What was that?

198
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,040
It's a game. Wanna play?

199
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,220
I'll pass.

200
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,790
If I feel like it.

201
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,660
Okay.

202
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,540
Catch you later, then.

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,710
He disappeared, too.

204
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,680
What kind of game is this?

205
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,650
A game where you can actually die.

206
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,680
It's listed in the auction catalog.

207
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,230
I'm so mad!

208
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,440
I can't believe how he spouted off!

209
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
Damn it!

210
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,200
Still, he's right.

211
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,700
What do you mean?

212
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,790
Chill out a little.

213
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,900
We should start thinking about
taking this to the next level.

214
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,450
Next level?

215
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Hatsu.

216
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,080
You know, our special abilities.

217
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,500
Kurapika started learning Nen when we did.

218
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,690
But he was able to fight the Troupe

219
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,270
because of his special abilities.

220
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,760
Yeah, Kurapika obtained powers that

221
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,670
make him basically invincible against the Troupe

222
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,270
by placing his life on the line.

223
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,490
We can't follow his example.

224
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,540
We need abilities without
too much or too little risk,

225
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,150
which still fit our specialties.

226
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,840
Something practical and effective...

227
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,250
That's what we have to come up with.

228
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,420
Well, I knew this would happen.

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,770
Let's take this one step at a time.

230
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,670
First, what kind of abilities do you want?

231
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,300
What kind of abilities do I want?

232
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,180
Hey!

233
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,680
You must have at least a vague idea.

234
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,600
Uh, a really strong power!

235
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,180
That's too vague!

236
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,890
Start by thinking within your own category.

237
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,310
You're an Enhancer,

238
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,880
so think of a power that strengthens something.

239
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,390
Then we ask,

240
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,550
what part of you do you
want to strengthen, and how?

241
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,730
That hurt!

242
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,450
What about you, then?

243
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,080
I already know what I want.

244
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,160
That's why I'm helping you.

245
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,140
Really? What do you want?

246
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,240
It's a secret.

247
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,340
Huh?

248
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,950
Gon, I'm going to go start
practicing my special ability.

249
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,090
You keep thinking about it.

250
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,460
Though it's possible that I'm the only
one who'll pass the screening.

251
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,600
He'll just get distracted

252
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,360
unless I give him a scare.

253
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,960
Visualize my aura fusing with electricity.

254
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Then I visualize

255
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,380
the electricity being released,
while refining my Nen!

256
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,430
But with your Nen,

257
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,410
it'd be game over in no time.

258
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,720
Damn it!

259
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,700
I'll make him eat those words!

260
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,650
You sound determined, Gon.

261
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,100
Kurapika!

262
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,240
Are you better?

263
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,710
Yeah, my fever broke.

264
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,150
I'm fine now.

265
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
He doesn't look fine.

266
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,190
But if Kurapika finds out

267
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,160
that the spiders are still in Yorknew City...

268
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,300
Is there any way to stop him?

269
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,440
So how did the auction go?

270
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,250
I believe you were after an expensive game?

271
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,920
Oh, yeah...

272
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,920
Tea

273
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,560
I see.

274
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,930
So they're screening players...

275
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,680
Say, what kind of training did you do?

276
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,110
Once I decided to conjure chains,

277
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,080
I did a lot of image training...

278
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,930
I closed my eyes, while feeling real chains.

279
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,900
I drew hundreds, thousands of sketches.

280
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,840
I looked at chains, licked chains...
I also smelled and listened to chains.

281
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,260
My master told me to do nothing
but handle chains all the time.

282
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,780
After a while, he took them away.

283
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,340
That was when I began to hallucinate chains...

284
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,240
Eventually, those hallucinations
began to feel heavy and cold,

285
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,760
and I could hear them grating.

286
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,810
Once I reached that point,
I was able to conjure chains.

287
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,800
Other than that, I did the same training as you.

288
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,170
Ten and Ren.

289
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,240
I know, Kurapika...

290
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,070
You can be my master!

291
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,130
You can point out what I'm doing right.

292
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,820
This way, I can keep Kurapika occupied
while the auction takes place.

293
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,090
I'm sorry, but I cannot.

294
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,780
Huh?

295
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,200
My boss will be leaving tomorrow.

296
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,080
I am obligated to accompany her.

297
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,890
You're leaving Yorknew City?

298
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,840
Yeah.

299
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,610
I'm still concerned about the spiders...

300
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,390
But it's been two days,

301
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,880
so they're probably already gone.

302
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,350
Yeah, that's a good idea.

303
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,110
Who taught you Nen?

304
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,850
You should probably

305
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,190
ask them rather than me.

306
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,360
Special abilities?
That sounds like you boys.

307
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,350
I can tell you right now

308
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,200
that Enhancers don't need special abilities.

309
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,620
Why not?

310
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,890
Because Enhancers are the

311
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,840
most balanced between offense and defense.

312
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,890
If you master Ten and Ren,

313
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,000
those will be strong enough to be
considered special abilities.

314
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,750
But I don't have time.

315
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,870
I have to pass a screening in four days...

316
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,760
Gon-kun,

317
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,620
if I were a judge,

318
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,640
I would be disappointed to see
an improvised special ability.

319
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,990
Listen carefully, Gon-kun.

320
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,270
You must not emulate that Kurapika person.

321
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm sure you don't need me to tell you why.

322
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,200
No...

323
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,410
You needn't emulate anyone else

324
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,540
when you're already so strong.

325
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,810
You think so?

326
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,730
Of course.

327
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,420
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.

328
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,850
That should help you find the answer you seek.

329
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,410
A-A hint...

330
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,720
Please give me a hint!

331
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,930
You sound pretty flustered...

332
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,650
Haste makes waste.

333
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,950
In the end, hard work always pays off.

334
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,440
I would agree if it weren't for this deadline...

335
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,900
All right, here's a big hint, then.

336
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,990
You only showed that Tsezgerra
person your normal Ren, right?

337
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,700
Yeah.

338
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,080
Next time, show him everything simultaneously.

339
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,800
Everything?

340
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,930
Yes, listen carefully.

341
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,090
Show him everything you've
learned simultaneously.

342
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,860
Everything I've learned simultaneously.

343
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,020
Ten...

344
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,410
Shroud myself in aura.

345
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,080
Zetsu...

346
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,910
Suppress my aura.

347
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,170
Ren...

348
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,940
Bring forth an incredible amount of aura.

349
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,250
And Hatsu...

350
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,500
Wait.

351
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,080
Ren requires me to bring forth aura,

352
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,630
while Zetsu requires suppressing it.

353
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,620
If I do them both at once...

354
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,540
Oh?

355
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,070
His brain fried again?

356
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,510
Hang in there, Gon.

357
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,880
If you take too long,

358
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,310
I'll leave you behind!

359
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,830
It's impossible...

360
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,890
How do I bring forth and suppress
something at the same time?

361
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,640
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.

362
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,570
After Wing-san helped unleash my Nen,

363
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,860
I went into battle knowing only Ten,

364
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,000
and got myself seriously hurt.

365
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,190
But in the process, I mastered Zetsu.

366
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,790
Then I learned Gyo to see through
Hisoka's special ability.

367
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,410
Gyo?

368
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,170
Right! I have Gyo!

369
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,930
Gyo...

370
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,680
Concentrate aura in your eyes

371
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,600
to see hidden aura.

372
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,290
Concentrate?

373
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,870
Right, I concentrated on my eyes,

374
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,470
so I never noticed what else was happening.

375
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,560
There's a little aura being released.

376
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,320
If I can suppress it,

377
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,090
I'll be doing everything at once!

378
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,320
Yes! I did it!

379
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,360
No good...

380
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,830
The second I relaxed, it fell apart.

381
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,720
But it works!

382
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,900
If I can concentrate the aura
from my Ren in one place,

383
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,200
that'll be a lot of power.

384
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,280
I want to test that power!

385
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,070
Gon-kun, haste makes waste.

386
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,380
Osu!

387
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,150
He finally figured something out.

388
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,800
You won't beat me, Gon!

389
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,020
The two boys are about to
undergo a new awakening.

390
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:18,250
G.I. Tutorial

391
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,060
Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!

392
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,040
Today is the first episode
of Greed Island Tutorial!

393
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,870
What does "tutorial" mean?

394
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,200
It's like an instruction manual.

395
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,350
Each week, we'll explain how the game works.

396
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,170
Click.

397
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,440
Continue!

398
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,260
Next time: End x And x Beginning.

399
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,130
Book!

400
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,130
Achoo!

401
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,750
Game!

402
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,600
Boom!

403
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
What's your name?

404
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,280
Gon!

405
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
Good job.
