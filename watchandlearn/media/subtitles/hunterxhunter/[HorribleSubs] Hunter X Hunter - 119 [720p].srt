2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,230
I saw him back at the staircase...

3
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,870
Did he do it?

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,780
Sorry, but what's about to happen is

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,510
just me blowing off some steam.

6
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,980
Strong x Or x Weak

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,820
He disappeared?

8
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,140
Godspeed.

9
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,960
The difference in initial action
speed was so overwhelming

10
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,160
that Youpi had no time to
make a sound or transform.

11
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,880
Killua's Godspeed placed an
electrical burden upon his own body,

12
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,410
making it possible for his body to
perform at a level far beyond

13
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,260
what should have been possible.

14
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,980
Killua had divided this power
into two different abilities:

15
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,040
Speed of Lightning, which allowed
him to control his body at will,

16
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,450
Speed of Lightning

17
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,710
and Whirlwind, which allowed his body
to react automatically to his opponent.

18
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,460
Whirlwind

19
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,480
In a previous fight, he'd used the
latter to stop his opponent's dart.

20
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,400
A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response

21
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,690
to vibrations in aura that
indicate the opponent's hostility.

22
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,050
The attack bypasses commands from his brain,

23
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,620
unleashing attacks that transcend his
own limits by relying on reflexes alone,

24
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,570
allowing him to easily surpass
his opponent's physical speed.

25
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,880
What's going on here?

26
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,310
All of these guys have less than
ten percent of my raw power.

27
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,820
This makes no sense...

28
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,190
I can't do a thing against him.

29
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,490
Whirlwind!

30
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Profound...

31
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,030
This "aura" stuff is intense...

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,550
This is getting interesting.

33
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,010
Before my explosion, I never would
have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle.

34
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,260
Youpi's change in heart would lead him
to make an unbelievable choice,

35
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
but this would not happen until later.

36
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,090
Crap!

37
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,530
I used it all up!

38
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,780
Hold it!

39
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,500
You're not getting away!

40
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,330
You're seeing this through with me...

41
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,370
Until you die!

42
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,640
He disappeared?

43
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,760
Again.

44
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,050
He vanished, as though he were
never here to begin with.

45
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,560
That's it...

46
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,410
At least one of them must have the ability

47
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,550
to make people appear and disappear at will.

48
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,320
Huh?

49
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,280
Please enter your passcode.

50
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,660
Damn, I didn't get a code.

51
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,840
Your passcode and name do not match.

52
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,930
Please reenter your passcode.

53
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,840
A second input error will result in your restraint.

54
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,720
He came down here without a passcode?

55
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,490
Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.

56
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,740
The door has been locked.

57
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,230
Please enter your passcode.

58
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,900
This is my chance!

59
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,100
I have two options.

60
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,510
The elevator will fill with
sleeping gas eventually.

61
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,240
Once he's asleep, I have to decide.

62
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,130
One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,

63
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,510
Monitor Room

64
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,780
and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.

65
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,750
This way, when he wakes up,
he'll still be stuck in the elevator.

66
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,730
But there's a high risk that someone above
will notice that the elevator isn't coming up.

67
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,900
Two, I move Brovada somewhere
else while he's asleep.

68
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,270
There are plenty of trucks parked around.

69
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,280
And the warehouse doors require a
passcode to open from the inside.

70
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,910
When he wakes up, Brovada won't
be able to open them.

71
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,410
And if I use the cargo entrance
to return to the surface,

72
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,920
the risk that I'll encounter enemies will
be much lower than if I take the elevator.

73
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
No! That won't work!

74
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,070
I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!

75
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,680
That's the safest option!

76
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,930
Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse,
and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders.

77
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,930
That's the least it'll take!

78
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,270
I'll stick the barrel of my gun through
the gap in his armor and open fire.

79
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,430
Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,

80
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,200
but he had never killed anyone
with his own hands before.

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,320
Enter your passcode at once.

82
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,460
If a passcode is not entered
within thirty seconds,

83
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,810
the restraining process will begin.

84
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,220
The monitor room in the border guard area...

85
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,470
There should be a monitor
for the elevator camera,

86
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,450
and a button to open the doors!

87
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,630
Well, I'm outside now,

88
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,300
but I had to destroy the elevator...

89
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,030
Is there another exit?

90
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,420
I was naïve...

91
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,580
I didn't expect him to shoot the door.

92
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,680
What now?

93
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,690
Do I wait for him to lower his guard,
then sneak out the cargo entrance?

94
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,810
Or do I wait for him to leave?

95
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,330
Either way, if he goes back to the surface...

96
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,390
That's not good enough!

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,030
I'm being naïve!

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,840
If he returns to the surface,

99
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,000
and tells the others that Flutter's dead,

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,820
I'll be able to move around freely!

101
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Am I an idiot?

102
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,000
If I allow an enemy to return to the surface,
I'm putting everyone else in more danger.

103
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,160
This one's tough.

104
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,270
I can't let him go back up...

105
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,280
If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!

106
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes, this way!

107
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm gonna trap you.

108
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,990
A little farther...

109
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,310
Wait until he's a little farther from it...

110
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,330
Now!

111
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,080
So there was someone besides Flutter...

112
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,100
Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,110
Too bad for you.

114
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,910
If only one path remains, it's too good
to be true. Anyone would be suspicious.

115
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,120
Well, now I know about you.

116
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,880
And I bet you're hiding in the
monitor room to watch me, chicken!

117
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,520
Damn...

118
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,250
I could have completely
trapped him in that hallway...

119
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,390
But there's no way out from where he is now.

120
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,400
He's still trapped.

121
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,250
Sleeping gas will eventually
fill the room, and he'll...

122
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,340
Crap! He isn't trapped!

123
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,650
There's a way out!

124
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,630
I should get out of here...

125
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,110
That's probably sleeping gas.

126
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,780
I have to do something before he realizes.

127
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,900
I know...

128
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,810
The armored vehicles in the garage.

129
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,200
With those, I could at least lock him in.

130
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,780
But then I'll have no way to get
back to the surface, either!

131
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,430
Think...

132
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,680
Is there anything I can use here?

133
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,180
Come up with the best possible plan, fast!

134
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,610
I guess I have to blow through this shutter...

135
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,440
How annoying!

136
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,630
I have to do this!

137
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,300
Damn! All that firing, and I
barely scorched the surface?

138
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,780
Guess I'll need to think of something else...

139
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,280
I know!

140
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,210
You can operate the shutters
from the monitor room,

141
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,210
Monitor Room

142
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,810
so I can go there to open the shutters.

143
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,330
Nice idea!

144
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,470
Wait,

145
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,440
I have to go through the shutters
to reach the monitor room.

146
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,250
Damn, so I have to get through these
shutters to return to the surface?

147
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
Wait...

148
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,990
There might be a way

149
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,810
to escape without busting down the shutters.

150
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,800
The shutter's opening?

151
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,310
An armored vehicle?

152
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,010
That's something a chicken would use.

153
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,150
But the shutter behind it is still shut.

154
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,130
The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.

155
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,910
Which means that...

156
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,520
First,

157
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,220
he closed the front shutter and
parked the vehicle there.

158
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,950
Then he returned to the monitor room,

159
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,530
and started raising the front shutter

160
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:55,290
and lowering the back one,
before racing back to the vehicle?

161
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,690
Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?

162
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,270
He closed off his only escape
route, just to finish me off?

163
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,940
Heh... Yeah, right.

164
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,700
So there's more than one...

165
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,930
The other's watching in the monitor room.

166
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,390
Pisses me off!

167
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,060
Watch this, you peeping tom...

168
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,820
I'm gonna drag your buddy
out of the armored vehicle

169
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,320
and rip him to shreds!

170
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm the only one here.

171
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,670
I have to do something...

172
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,080
By myself!

173
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,340
That's tough armor!

174
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,600
I did it!

175
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,930
Crap! He blocked the elevator!

176
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,100
I could have blown a hole in the
ceiling, and climbed up the wire!

177
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,590
I've blocked his escape route.

178
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,570
First hurdle cleared!

179
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,130
You have guts to show yourself...

180
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!

181
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,150
Smoke?

182
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,150
Did he kill himself?

183
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,690
Miss his chance to escape?

184
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,520
Either way, there's no way to move this thing!

185
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,800
There's only a few centimeters of space.

186
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,130
The elevator's completely blocked!

187
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,680
Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!

188
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,680
If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!

189
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,950
Open the damned shutter!

190
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,870
You hear me?

191
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,600
Being an octopus, I only need a few
centimeters to squeeze through.

192
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,320
Second hurdle cleared.

193
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,200
Hey!

194
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,160
Open the shutter!

195
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,610
Now, I just have to wait for the
sleeping gas to fill the room.

196
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,850
I can hold my breath,

197
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,840
but I don't want to waste time.

198
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,200
Wait for the right timing!

199
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,830
Third hurdle cleared.

200
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,300
Be patient.

201
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,320
Nice and slow.

202
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,390
This is the final hurdle.

203
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,020
I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done.

204
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,870
Fire! This is the best option!

205
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,870
I'll be safest if I control his body
and return to the surface!

206
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,880
Which means I have to kill him...

207
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm the only one here.

208
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,380
There's no one else to help me!

209
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,590
I h-have to...

210
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,250
kill him!

211
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,200
I can't do it!

212
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,460
I'm...

213
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,590
I'm...

214
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,340
just a coward!

215
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,480
While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...

216
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,500
Within the shifted central tower,
as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,

217
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,580
he was battling doubts of his own, as well.

218
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,430
Hold on.

219
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,080
What if...

220
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,190
Pitou! Pouf!

221
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,160
Are you there?

222
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,300
Hey!

223
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,330
What if it isn't that he chose
not to respond to Youpi,

224
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,360
but that he wasn't able to respond?

225
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,770
Within the cocoon should be
nothing but a goopy mess.

226
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,420
He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.

227
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:01,430
If he's utterly defenseless
while he changes forms,

228
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,790
this is the time to attack.

229
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:12,270
Would he really make such a literally
fatal mistake in this situation?

230
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,530
It's not possible!

231
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,420
This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.

232
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,380
But the question is whether the
trap activates when I attack,

233
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,390
or if it's already been activated,
before I've even attacked.

234
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,750
Which is it?

235
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,400
You have doubts because you
are good at what you do.

236
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,970
However, that is all there is to it.

237
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,510
Attack? Don't attack?

238
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,380
What do I do?

239
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,840
Next time: Fake x And x Real.

240
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,320
Hey... If not now, when?

241
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,920
Not yet!

242
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,060
You're a fake. You aren't Killua.
