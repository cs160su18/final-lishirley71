2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,730
Championship Finals, round 7!

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,820
Ready...

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Go!

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,790
First comes rock...

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,740
Rock... Paper...

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,450
Scissors!

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,620
Killua wins!

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,820
Yes!

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,210
Congratulations.

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,840
Here is your prize, the Sword of Truth.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,760
Look, Gon...

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,260
Sword of Truth
Sword that cuts through
anything false. Has been
used in trials to determine
criminals. Breaks if used
to cut something true,
but will regenerate if left
in scabbard for a day.

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,320
This is card #83.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,860
It goes in a restricted slot.

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,640
Okay, that's one down.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,020
Score!

18
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Reality x And x Raw

19
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,060
The problem

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,780
is how we protect the card.

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,050
We don't have any defensive spell cards.

22
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,030
Wait, kids!

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,530
H-Hand over the Sword of Truth!

24
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,410
Do as I say,

25
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,290
and I won't be rough with you.

26
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,330
No way, stupid.

27
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,300
W-Wait!

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,250
Book!

29
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,070
Book!

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,030
Hmph, you're bluffing.

31
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,810
I know that you just started this game.

32
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,530
You have no defensive spells,

33
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,080
and all you would have in your restricted slots

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,500
is the Sword of Truth.

35
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,690
This is Thief!

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,200
Thief
Steal one random card
from a restricted slot
of one target player.
[SR][ATK]

37
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,920
This spell card lets you steal

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,200
one random card from
another player's restricted slots!

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,700
Take this...

40
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,800
Thief on!

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,180
Attack Killua!

42
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,830
Haven't you been training at all,

43
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,940
Mister?

44
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,340
Next time, I won't return your card.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,340
You must be an amateur.

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm impressed you got into a game for Hunters.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,590
But that was very educational.

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,110
An attack spell won't kick in
until you finish the chant.

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,740
Th-That only works against weak players!

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,980
Precisely.

51
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,360
If you want a card,
you take it from someone.

52
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,440
Only fools would participate in tournaments.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,560
Understand, boys?

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,660
I'm so pissed!

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,810
Just forget it.

56
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,650
Those guys were obviously pros.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,320
At least we didn't waste too much effort.

58
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,910
Damn it!

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,640
Then I'm gonna start getting spell cards!

60
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,640
That means our next destination
will be Masadora, City of Magic.

61
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,460
No objections!

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,330
That's our base.

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,810
We'll begin assigning roles.

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,970
You will collect spell cards for us.

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,020
You've probably heard that there
are forty different spell cards.

66
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,180
We need you to obtain
one of those cards, Prison.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:02,070
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed from
their slot. (Can only
target pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

68
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,210
This is one of the strongest defensive spells.

69
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,230
We could certainly use another one of these.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,320
In order to protect Breath of Archangel.

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,620
Breath of Archangel?

72
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,170
A super-rare SS card that no one's

73
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,590
ever been able to obtain.

74
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,080
How can you be certain no
one's gotten one before?

75
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:25,090
List
Reveal number of card
holders and number of
cards for a target item.
[LR][NORM]

76
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,110
There's a spell card called List.

77
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,670
When you cast it,

78
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,090
you can learn the maximum
transformation limit of any card

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,250
as well as the number of current card holders.

80
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,610
I see.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,500
The card is very difficult to obtain

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,710
because you must have all forty spell
cards before you can trade for one.

83
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,140
But spell cards are extremely
useful in this game,

84
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,420
so players tend to use them up.

85
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,120
However, we've been able

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,490
to collect all forty spell cards.

87
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,000
We would prefer to trade them in for
a Breath of Archangel at once...

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,280
But then you'd have no cards to protect it.

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,260
That's why you need a copy of Prison.

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,740
Exactly.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,640
At any rate, to carry out this plan,

92
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,300
we'll need you all to memorize
the forty different spell cards.

93
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,150
Those four Galgaida cards
netted us 120,000 Jenny.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,850
They were pretty valuable.

95
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,820
We don't need to worry about money now.

96
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,150
Let's buy some food and water,
so we can start for Masadora!

97
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,160
First, we'll need a map.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,910
Map of Island
A blank map that
automatically fills in
locations as the owner
visits and gathers
information about them.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,910
Map of Island
A detailed map
showing cities
and important
locations, as well
as useful information
such as hot spots!

100
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,750
The one with information costs 650,000,

101
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,910
while the blank one is 20,000.

102
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,690
Which one should we get?

103
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,790
The 20,000 one.

104
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,990
It'll be more fun to fill it in ourselves.

105
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,280
You're so positive, it's painful.

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,970
Gain.

107
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,430
This doesn't tell us anything.

108
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,060
Then let's ask.

109
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,940
Head north for eighty kilometers.

110
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,550
After you pass the mountain,
you'll reach a lake.

111
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,620
If you follow the lake north,
you should reach Masadora.

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,430
If we hurry, we can go
eighty kilometers in a day.

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,280
Yep.

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,310
Assuming you survive.

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,660
The mountain is crawling with bandits.

116
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,960
And once you pass the mountain,
you'll encounter hordes of monsters.

117
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,330
Bandits?

118
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,460
Monsters?

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,450
Now it sounds more like an RPG!

120
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,490
I wanna see these monsters!

121
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,520
Let's hurry up!

122
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,360
All right!

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,910
Off we go!

124
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,220
Please wait!

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,200
I beg you!

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,850
What?

127
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,270
Please let me join you!

128
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,170
Oh, sorry.

129
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,730
Can't.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,230
Wh-Why not?

131
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,740
You'd be a nuisance.

132
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,770
Little brat...

133
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,960
You dare call me a nuisance?

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,750
If I chose to, I could mop the floor with
you, with one hand behind my back.

135
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,540
That does it.

136
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,210
I was just going to tease these boys a little,

137
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,170
but now I'm going to ruin their lives.

138
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,240
Hey, hold it right there!

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,570
Please!

140
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,840
I'll try really hard not to get in your way!

141
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay, I have most of the information we need.

142
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,540
Then, can you tell us what you found?

143
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,400
All right. I'll start with number one.

144
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,210
I tried a hundred different people in this city,

145
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,940
and they all gave the same response

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,230
when faced with an unusual question.

147
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,950
This is typical behavior
for in-game characters.

148
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,230
Number two.

149
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,790
Book.

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,920
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.

151
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,620
This card is real.

152
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,490
This one is a copy Kortopi made.

153
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,310
Gain.

154
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,430
Kortopi's card didn't transform.

155
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,950
I believe that means the game's program

156
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,570
didn't recognize Kortopi's card.

157
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,180
Number three.

158
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,940
Shizuku's vacuum works in this world,

159
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,570
but it won't work on any items
with special abilities.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,270
I think that's because the game was programmed

161
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,610
so Nen couldn't be used to collect cards.

162
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,820
So?

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,370
However, the above three points

164
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,330
indicate another possibility.

165
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,020
This game isn't taking place
in a virtual world.

166
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,080
It's based somewhere in the real world.

167
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,840
What do you mean?

168
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,020
If the players actually entered the game,

169
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,830
their spirits would detach from
their bodies and enter the console,

170
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,100
leaving the bodies behind.

171
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,260
Sending them physically into the
game would be unnecessary.

172
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,160
And separating spirit from
body should require more

173
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,980
than standing before a console and using Hatsu.

174
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,120
It's more logical that the players
are actually warped elsewhere.

175
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,240
Thus,

176
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,780
Greed Island isn't a real game.

177
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,280
It's a trap that sends players who
use Hatsu here, to this island.

178
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,070
That makes sense.

179
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,000
But what does it mean?

180
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,010
Do you remember the reward
for clearing this game?

181
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,540
Let's see...

182
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,510
What was it?

183
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,370
You can select three item cards

184
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,270
from your restricted slots,
to take back to the real world.

185
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,630
Right.

186
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,230
That means these items can
be used outside the island.

187
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,540
If this game takes place in the real world,

188
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,620
it should be possible to remove

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,220
the treasure without clearing the game.

190
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,140
I understand.

191
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,560
Book.

192
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,860
At the moment, we only
know about a few items.

193
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,790
It would be ideal to learn all of the cards.

194
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,710
So our first objective is
the spell card God Eye.

195
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,300
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]

196
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,900
Now we just need to find Phinks and Feitan.

197
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,260
Another cheap map?

198
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,130
But he was carrying a lot of spell cards.

199
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,590
Well, let's split up for now.

200
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,070
In one week, we'll meet in Masadora.

201
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,920
It's a contest to see who
can kill more players.

202
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,870
Okay, be sure to take their cards first.

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,710
Hey, what should we do about her?

204
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,140
Just ignore her.

205
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,180
Once the bandits show up,
we'll have a chance to ditch her.

206
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,140
Isn't that kind of mean?

207
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,980
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,520
Tsezgerra let her pass,
so she must have strong Nen.

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,530
She should be able to escape if it gets hairy.

210
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,540
I didn't think she'd keep up this long.

211
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,190
They have considerable physical strength.

212
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,020
For a couple of kids, anyway.

213
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,240
Let's take them.

214
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,050
Yeah.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,340
Please help us!

216
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,520
We beg you!

217
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,580
Huh?

218
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,180
A disease is going around the island.

219
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,190
It starts with a mild fever,

220
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,140
grows to a high fever, and
eventually leads to death.

221
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,450
All we can do is use medicine
to keep the fever in check.

222
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,020
But the medicine will only work for a week.

223
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,740
It's also incredibly expensive,

224
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,080
and we've run out of money...

225
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,620
We've all fallen ill,

226
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,590
so we're unable to do any bandit work.

227
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,400
Is it contagious?

228
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,420
That's just a scenario.

229
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,500
My son only has two or three days to live!

230
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,660
Could you spare us any money?

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,510
This is an in-game event, right?

232
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,680
Yeah, if we give them money,

233
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,310
they should provide us with
items or information.

234
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,630
Uh, how much do you need?

235
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,270
80,000 Jenny.

236
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,430
That's all we have left.

237
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,460
So they know everything about us.

238
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,430
Um,

239
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,320
I have enough to cover 80,000 Jenny.

240
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,190
Ah, could you shut up for a moment?

241
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,570
I'm gonna kill that brat.

242
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,020
Got it.

243
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,360
We can give you 80,000 Jenny.

244
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,900
Really?

245
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,480
Thank you so much!

246
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,580
You've saved my son's life!

247
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm c-cold.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,150
So cold...

249
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,750
Oh, no!

250
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,680
If his body gets any colder,

251
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,690
he'll die before we can
get him the medicine!

252
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,390
If only we had some children's clothes!

253
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,470
Some children's clothes!

254
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
Um, I can give him my clothes.

255
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,350
That'd really be okay?

256
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,230
You're like angels!

257
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,060
Words are not enough...

258
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,110
...to express our gratitude!

259
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,850
Nah, we don't need thanks.

260
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,930
How about some information or items?

261
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,000
We got nothing?

262
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,000
We lost our clothes,
and now we're totally broke.

263
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,620
Damn, they're mocking us!

264
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,260
What was that about?

265
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,720
But once we get past this mountain,

266
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,830
we'll find lots of monsters, right?

267
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,820
Yeah.

268
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,520
If we beat them and turn them into cards,
we can sell them for lots of cash.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,520
We finally get to start fighting!

270
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,520
Time to see what you've got.

271
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,860
Ditto.

272
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,150
I wanna see what you accomplished
during your secret training.

273
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,150
This area is rocky...

274
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,130
Let's go!

275
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,910
Yeah!

276
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,160
There are tons of them!

277
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,270
Gon's punch did no damage?

278
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,110
So no amount of punching will take one down.

279
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,860
And there are so many.

280
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,360
In order to disable it with a single attack...

281
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,360
Bingo! The eye is its weakness.

282
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,780
Book.

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,280
Gon, aim for the eye!

284
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,750
Got it!

285
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,950
They're moving around too much,

286
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,640
but they're doing reasonably well.

287
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,850
Weaker than they looked.

288
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,110
The card reverted after we
left it alone for a minute.

289
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,120
We can do this.

290
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
The monsters come with weaknesses.

291
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,010
If we stay calm and think, we'll be fine.

292
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,190
Okay.

293
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's head for Masadora, then.

294
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,630
Yeah!

295
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,030
Huh?

296
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,720
Gon!

297
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,470
I'm okay!

298
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,030
That didn't hurt.

299
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,970
This one's weak.

300
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,670
But it's fast!

301
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,290
Let's catch it.

302
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,300
Damn!

303
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,800
Watch the trajectory,
not its current location.

304
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,270
With observation, you can learn an
opponent's pattern of motion.

305
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,970
Your eyes are sharp, but you
aren't using them properly.

306
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,310
It got away from us.

307
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,200
Well, it won't take very
long to reach Masadora

308
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,820
if they're all this weak.

309
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,820
Don't be stupid!

310
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,330
What if you encounter a monster
that's both strong and fast?

311
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,610
Bubbles?

312
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,230
It's gone...

313
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,480
It's loud and generates a shock wave,

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,090
but it doesn't do any damage.

315
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,350
When you touch them,

316
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,610
the red ones don't pop.

317
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,230
The white bubbles pop

318
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,240
when they make contact with a human aura.

319
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,470
The red ones pop when they make
contact with anything else.

320
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,140
To catch that horse, you must
identify which bubble is which,

321
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,090
then switch between Zetsu and Ten.

322
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,320
That's still too difficult for them.

323
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,530
Still...

324
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,880
These boys are...

325
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,880
These boys are just

326
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,890
wasting their potential!

327
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,190
They're raw stones that'll shine like
diamonds with a little polishing!

328
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,700
But at this rate, they'll run into
stronger players or monsters,

329
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,350
and it'll be game over!

330
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,380
This one looks tougher.

331
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,020
That's it...

332
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,510
I've had enough!

333
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Gyo!

334
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
Keep your eyes on it!

335
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,190
Use Gyo!

336
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,340
Don't you know how?

337
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,370
See that?

338
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,550
The armor's just a puppet,

339
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,130
so attacks won't work against it.

340
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,560
Here it is!

341
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,630
I got the card!

342
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,690
So you can use Gyo.

343
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,880
Why didn't you use it before?

344
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,250
Uh, well...

345
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,320
Yeah...

346
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,830
So you forgot.

347
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,820
Why are you just standing there?

348
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,600
Gyo!

349
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,470
What do you see?

350
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,900
The number 1.

351
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,940
Good.

352
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,970
Listen up.

353
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,290
If I lift my finger, you use Gyo.

354
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,970
And then you holler out what you see.

355
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,500
If you ever sense anything suspicious, use Gyo.

356
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,840
Got it?

357
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,230
Wait, why are you ordering us around?

358
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,870
The number 5!

359
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,630
Correct.

360
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Drop and give me two hundred push-ups.

361
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,460
Huh?

362
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,640
It's your punishment!

363
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,540
Get to it!

364
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,240
What the hell? Why should I?

365
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,770
Got a problem?

366
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,990
You bet!

367
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,490
Who do you think you are?

368
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,710
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.

369
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,980
I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.

370
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,880
I first learned Nen forty years ago.

371
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,360
I'm going to use my wealth of
knowledge and experience

372
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,780
to coach you boys.

373
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,510
You should be grateful.

374
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,980
Forty years ago?!

375
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,020
You're an old hag!

376
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,140
As it turns out, the young girl
following Gon and Killua

377
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,690
is a highly experienced pro Hunter.

378
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,220
G.I. Tutorial

379
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,750
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

380
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,310
Today, we'll introduce the card God Eye.

381
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:19,040
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]

382
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,160
That's the card Shalnark wants.

383
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,320
If you use this spell, you get
a description of a given card,

384
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
number of holders, and total
number of cards in existence.

385
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,040
I want one!

386
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,250
Continue!

387
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,170
Next time: A x Hard x Master.

388
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,590
My master is Wing-san!

389
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,310
My master is—

390
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,960
P-Pow!

391
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,430
Another bump on the head...
