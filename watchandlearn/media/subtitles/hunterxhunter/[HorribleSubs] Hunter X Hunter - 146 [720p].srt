00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,410
Ging?

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Chairman x And x Release

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,750
Yo.

5
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,970
Ging!

6
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,030
I'm sorry!

7
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,510
It was my fault...

8
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,770
Because of me, Kite

9
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,020
turned into a little girl!

10
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,020
I h-heard he was captured by the enemy.

11
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,560
Yeah, I was with Kite...

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,030
Then Kite told me to run away,

13
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
and Pitou showed up.

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,470
Kite lost his arm, I was knocked out,

15
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,210
and then we trained...

16
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,750
Shoot got Kite out of the Ants' nest,

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,540
but it wasn't Kite...

18
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,050
They did all kinds of horrible things!

19
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,210
When I met Pitou again,

20
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,560
Pitou said that Kite was already dead!

21
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,350
Okay, I get it!

22
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,440
Well, I don't get it, but just have a seat, okay?

23
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,410
U-Uh... Er...

24
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,680
Let's calm down.

25
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,820
We should both try to calm down...

26
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,560
It was because I insisted...

27
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,320
on having my way!

28
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,650
Oh, um...

29
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,060
A-A-Anyway...

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,580
Just calm down first.

31
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,520
Ging is...

32
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,330
Ging is actually flustered.

33
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,370
I should have

34
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,840
been the one who died!

35
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,700
Gon.

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,710
That isn't true.

37
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,220
He took you along because he believed in you.

38
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,350
He told you to run because he'd
underestimated the enemy.

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,950
If he hadn't thought you capable,

40
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,360
he wouldn't have let you accompany
him, no matter what you'd said.

41
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,990
It was his fault that he misjudged the enemy.

42
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,920
But—

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,890
I know.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
You're also at fault for being too weak!

45
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,500
You should feel responsible.

46
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,430
Don't make the same mistake.

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,440
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!

48
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,280
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,

49
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
but either way, you should apologize!

50
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,150
Yeah.

51
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,890
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,330
Do you know it?

53
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,200
Huh?

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,140
No, what is it?

55
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,170
You promise to do things differently next time.

56
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,150
And you keep that promise, no matter what.

57
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,710
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,820
Okay, get going!

59
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah!

60
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,160
Ging?

61
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,370
Can I...

62
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,670
talk to you some more later?

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,410
That might be difficult.

64
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,170
I'm a busy man...

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,180
That's crap, Ging!

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,240
Aren't you his father?

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,650
How cold can you be?!

68
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,030
I know about Greed Island!

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,090
You never went to see Gon after he cleared it!

70
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,440
Too bashful or something?

71
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,520
All you you, shut up!

72
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,810
It's none of your business!

73
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,070
You're a jerk, Ging!

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,460
You should apologize to Gon!

75
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,710
Promise him you'll act more like a father!

76
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,370
Hell, you don't have the right
to say you're his father!

77
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,580
Make up your minds!

78
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,080
You can all screw yourselves!

79
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,150
You should have Leorio punch you again!

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,130
Yeah, just shut up!

81
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,450
Fine, then...

82
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,960
I'll be waiting, so get going!

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,710
How stupid do you think we are?

84
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,250
You take him there!

85
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,350
Aren't you his father?

86
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,870
Okay, fine!

87
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll take you all on!

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
If you have a problem with
what I'm doing, bring it on!

89
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,690
You're all against me? Okay!

90
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,420
That's fine by me!

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,850
Everyone!

92
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,890
Quiet down!

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,620
The election isn't over yet.

94
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,620
Yes, I still haven't given up.

95
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,270
A new last chance has appeared!

96
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,490
Gon-kun—

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,040
Go ahead, then.

98
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,640
Due to the circumstances, no one
can leave until the election is over.

99
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,440
You're in a hurry, aren't you?

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,510
But this will be the final vote.

101
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,900
Once you vote, you'll be allowed to leave.

102
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,620
If you tell us your choice right now,

103
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,400
everyone here will accept that as a valid vote.

104
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,310
Between myself, Pariston, and Leorio-san,

105
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,910
whom do you believe is most
fit to become chairman?

106
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,550
I should mention that the
former chairman, Netero,

107
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,170
is taking an extended vacation
after defeating the Ant King.

108
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,400
How can you say such a thing?

109
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,770
If Gon picks Leorio after his dramatic arrival,

110
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,700
everyone may get caught up in
the heat of the moment again

111
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
and vote for Leorio.

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,740
Chairman?

113
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,490
Leorio's running for chairman?

114
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,450
No! See, some stuff happened...

115
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,190
Gon-kun,

116
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,980
you can rely on your gut.

117
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,450
Be true to your heart,

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,870
and pick one of us.

119
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,620
Uh... Then,

120
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,850
I'll pick Pariston-san!

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,330
Huh?

122
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,630
Isn't Leorio-san your friend?

123
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,010
Shouldn't you pick him?

124
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,650
Nope, because Leorio wants
to become a doctor,

125
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,100
so he can't be chairman!

126
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,950
Of course!

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,330
Now I've been completely defeated.

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,290
Thank you, Gon-kun.

129
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,660
Then let's begin the vote.

130
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,290
Oh, sorry.

131
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,750
I'm going with Gon.

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,220
My vote goes to Pariston.

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,590
Leorio...

134
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,170
I know.

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,760
Ging!

136
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,670
I'm going now!

137
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,680
Yeah.

138
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,170
Is that all you have to say, you idiot?

139
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,700
At least say, "See you later"!

140
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,830
Where's your common sense?

141
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,180
Ging's snapped!

142
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,900
Someone stop this negligent jerk of a father!

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,070
Heart Is Valuable

144
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
That's impossible!

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,000
Zodiacs, don't just stand there
and smile! Do something!

146
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,070
I guess, in his own way, Ging's popular.

147
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,590
Yeah, I guess so...

148
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,510
Hey, Gon!

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,830
I remembered something.

150
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm the one who taught Kite how to use Nen.

151
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,460
And I taught him his techniques.

152
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,990
There's a number that his
Crazy Slots won't bring up unless

153
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,220
he's adamant about not dying!

154
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,380
If he's still alive, that's probably why.

155
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,450
He would never consider dying in your place.

156
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,480
So don't mess up your apology.

157
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,230
Or he'll smack you again!

158
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,240
Got it!

159
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm off, then!

160
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah! I'll be waiting!

161
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,920
Again?

162
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,010
Ging...

163
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,270
Ninth Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 635
1) Pariston 458 (72.1%)
2) Leorio 157
Turnout: 96.8%  Valid Votes: 615

164
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,470
Hello, everyone.

165
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,110
I am your 13th chairman, Pariston.

166
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,020
And I have an important announcement.

167
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,450
I, Pariston, name Cheadle-san as vice chairman,

168
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,280
and resign as chairman.

169
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,780
Okay, then.

170
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,450
I didn't see that coming.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,410
How long must you make fools of us?!

172
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,670
Come back here!

173
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,930
I didn't become vice chairman because
I wanted to become chairman.

174
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,530
I just wanted to hinder the chairman.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,580
When I said silly things to tease him,

176
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,190
Netero-san always looked so happy...

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,450
I really wanted to play with him some more.

178
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,960
I recommend that you reform the Hunter
Exam and Commandments quickly.

179
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,340
Cheadle-san, if the Association becomes
a dull place under your leadership,

180
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,510
I'll get serious about toying with you.

181
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,830
Leorio, where's Killua?

182
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,620
Huh?

183
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, I don't know.

184
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,270
He isn't answering his phone.

185
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,720
It sounds like he was traveling,
looking for a way to save you.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,250
Well, once we contact him,
I'm sure he'll come see you.

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
I need to apologize to Killua.

188
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,260
When I was fighting the enemy, I got confused,

189
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,190
and I said terrible things to him.

190
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,150
I'm sorry, too.

191
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,020
Huh?

192
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,300
Why are you apologizing?

193
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,150
Well, sorry that I couldn't do anything
when you guys were in trouble.

194
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,190
Huh? What do you mean?

195
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,660
I don't get it.

196
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,650
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

197
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,920
The requests following a wish for a computer

198
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,190
should be more severe than playing
dead and a pat on the head.

199
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,130
When I heard Milluki's report,
that was the first thing that seemed off.

200
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,780
And when the two-choice wish resulted
in a simple kiss on the cheek,

201
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,510
it demanded fingernails, a far too heavy price.

202
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,470
Assuming that the fingernails were
the price for the computer,

203
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,170
Wish                                            Request

204
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,540
that would match the balance between
wishes and requests seen previously.

205
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,300
If my theory is correct,

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,140
playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something.

207
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,540
Thus, the two-choice wish didn't require a payment.

208
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,870
Why was that the case?

209
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,690
There are two possibilities.

210
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,170
One, because the wish was simple enough

211
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,350
that Something's power wasn't required.

212
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,010
Two,

213
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,260
because it wasn't a wish.

214
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,330
However, there's still an unresolved question here.

215
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,200
If playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something...

216
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,600
They were requests from Alluka, not Something.

217
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,080
Killua claims that Something calls him "Killua,"

218
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,650
and the request to play dead was made to "Brother."

219
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,920
Thus, the one who calls Killua "Brother" is Alluka.

220
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,710
If the request came from Alluka,

221
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,780
then Something wasn't awake,

222
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,360
and Killua shouldn't have been
able to make the two-choice wish.

223
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,950
However, Something responded to Killua's wish.

224
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,690
The hint to resolving this contradiction
lies in the wording Killua used.

225
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,950
When making the two-choice wish,
Killua was not asking.

226
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,520
He was commanding.

227
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,760
It makes sense that a command
would work differently than a wish,

228
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,220
and would not require a payment upon completion.

229
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,580
Those are my conclusions.

230
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,770
What do you think?

231
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,910
I'll get to the point.

232
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm the one who can use Something's power,
effectively and safely, for the Zoldyck family.

233
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,670
As it stands, Alluka is no more than
a spirit locked forever in one room.

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,920
But if I control him with you at his side,

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,500
at the very least, I can guarantee his freedom.

236
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,560
Brother...

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,840
I'll protect Alluka.

238
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,280
Kil, you need to learn your place.

239
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,610
Something, wake up.

240
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,270
'Kay.

241
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,110
Kil, this is your last chance.

242
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,130
Let me have Something—

243
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,130
Something!

244
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,130
Send Illumi back home!

245
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,630
'Kay.

246
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,990
Teleportation...

247
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,270
For real?

248
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,330
Oh, you were all watching?

249
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,700
That's amazing... He's invincible.

250
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,280
If Killua issues a command,

251
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,010
there is no need to worry about requests.

252
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,440
This means that turning Killua into
my puppet is worth any price.

253
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,090
Tsubone, Amane...

254
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,440
Can you leave us alone for a moment?

255
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,430
If you don't leave on your own,

256
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,200
I'll have to issue Something a command.

257
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,440
Killua, pat my head...

258
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,850
Something is doing this because
she wants me to praise her.

259
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,780
I don't want to use her by issuing commands.

260
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,470
So please...

261
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,820
Killua...

262
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,210
Killua!

263
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,830
Killua!

264
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,940
Killua...

265
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,220
Something...

266
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,990
Killua, pat my head.

267
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,380
You can't come out anymore.

268
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,270
I love Killua.

269
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,280
You can't come out, Something.

270
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,480
I love Killua.

271
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,660
I love Killua!

272
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,620
You can't!

273
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,670
Never come out again!

274
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,630
Got it?

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,050
'Kay...

276
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,680
Alluka is free now.

277
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,250
I'm sorry, Something.

279
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm sorry...

280
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
Alluka?

281
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,430
Brother?

282
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,850
Yep, it's your big—

283
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,060
Did you make Something cry?

284
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,960
Huh?

285
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,820
Er, well...

286
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,320
She's still hunched over, crying!

287
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,270
Apologize to her!

288
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,340
But...

289
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,700
Apologize!

290
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,220
If you're nice to me, you have to
be nice to Something, too!

291
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,590
If you're going to protect me,
you have to protect Something, too!

292
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,070
If you're mean to Something, I'll hate you!

293
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,320
Alluka, thank you.

294
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,280
I guess I was still under Ill-nii's control.

295
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,810
But everything's okay now.

296
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,500
Can you tell Something to come out?

297
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,650
Something, I'm sorry.

298
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,660
I was wrong.

299
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,240
I'm sorry!

300
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,780
I was scared of Ill-nii,

301
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,130
and I couldn't defy him.

302
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,690
So I did what he said, and I hated it.

303
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,710
When I realized he might force you

304
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,720
to do bad things, too, I got really scared...

305
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,290
For Alluka's sake, I lied to myself,

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
and I said mean things to you.

307
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,350
I'm really sorry!

308
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,180
Something,

309
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,900
I'll protect you.

310
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,260
We'll always be together!

311
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,330
Don't listen to wishes from anyone else anymore!

312
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,010
I'll pat you on the head whenever you want!

313
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,390
So would you please come out again?

314
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,210
'Kay...

315
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,220
Something,

316
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,830
will you forgive me for being a

317
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,100
bad big brother?

318
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,010
'Kay.

319
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,990
I...

320
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,240
love Killua.

321
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:55,000
Tsubone, I've rescinded the restriction on Killua.

322
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,790
Please let him know.

323
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Yes, I understand.

324
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,170
His first friend.

325
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,050
Too many memories to speak of.

326
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,640
A new journey.

327
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,760
Next time: Salvation x And x Future.
