2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,820
Alone?

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,820
I'm impressed.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,960
Where do you want to die?

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,610
I'll humor any requests.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,920
I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,
with no one nearby.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,060
Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.

8
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,040
Condition x And x Condition

9
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,770
Uvogin seeks to unleash
his rage upon Kurapika.

10
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,200
And Kurapika intends to

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,040
avenge his brethren against
the Phantom Troupe.

12
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,420
An inevitable battle is about to begin.

13
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,310
Yep, there they all go.

14
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,130
All of these are leech eggs?

15
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,070
That's disgusting...

16
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,310
Sorry about the wait.

17
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,960
I've got a question for you.

18
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,670
Who are you?

19
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,480
You're no ordinary Nen user.

20
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,600
I can sense a special intent
behind your Nen.

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,090
Before I can answer your question,

22
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,430
I need you to tell me something.

23
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,780
Do you remember the
people you've killed?

24
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,020
A little.

25
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,000
I can remember the people
who made an impression.

26
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,940
So you want revenge?

27
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,500
Who are you trying to avenge?

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,630
The Kurta.

29
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,040
Never heard of them.

30
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,890
A small clan, with Scarlet Eyes,
that lived in the Lukso Province.

31
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,140
Five years ago,

32
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,080
you attacked us.

33
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,940
Scarlet Eyes? What's that?

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,900
The name of a treasure?

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,770
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell...

36
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,400
But five years ago,
I was definitely a member.

37
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,800
When you kill a completely
innocent bystander,

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,510
what are you people thinking?

39
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,200
What do you feel?

40
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,670
Nothing at all.

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,300
Scum!

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,930
You will atone through death!

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,440
Fools like you are the reason
I never get sick of killing.

44
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,820
Wanna know what I enjoy most?

45
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,450
Denying those who come
in search of revenge!

46
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,600
Those chains are dangerous.

47
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't know what kind
of trick he used on them,

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,200
but they hold an abnormal amount of Nen.

49
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,610
Which means...

50
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,360
Strike first to win!

51
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,620
Got him.

52
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,340
That's a surprise...

53
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,140
After taking that punch,
he still has the strength to attack?

54
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,890
But his left arm is useless now.

55
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,910
What?

56
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,840
Unscathed?

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,650
Impossible...

58
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Considering the amount
of Nen in those chains,

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,410
he must be a Manipulator or a Conjurer...

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,300
I would guess the former.

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,180
But only an Enhancer should be
able to block my attack.

62
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,440
What is he?

63
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,880
Was that punch

64
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,050
the best you've got?

65
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,570
That wasn't even funny.

66
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,450
Don't worry.

67
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,940
That was twenty percent of my strength.

68
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,010
This time, I'll use half!

69
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,830
Here!

70
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,750
Damn!

71
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,220
Here!

72
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,190
Damn, he keeps darting around.

73
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,100
But...

74
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,770
I'll regret not using that
chance to chain you up?

75
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,360
Stop making excuses,
and give me your best shot.

76
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,870
You're wasting my time.

77
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,300
Okay, kid.

78
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll give you all I've got!

79
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,630
That's an incredible aura.

80
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,250
A smoke screen?

81
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,470
His presence has disappeared.

82
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,640
He's using In!

83
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,560
This time, I crushed your arm.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,110
No one can withstand

85
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,910
a full-strength Big Bang Impact.

86
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,850
But I'm impressed.

87
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,900
You reacted immediately.

88
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,880
I'm guessing you noticed the
slight shift in the smoke.

89
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,360
I am impressed, as well.

90
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,180
I didn't think you knew how to use In.

91
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,820
Striking the ground to
raise a smoke screen

92
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,810
was intended to conceal both your
physical body and your presence.

93
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,650
However...

94
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,200
I, too, can use In.

95
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,280
N-No way!

96
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,950
You can see them?

97
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,310
So you can use Gyo.

98
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,570
These chains were fortified
with a Conjurer's Nen.

99
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,800
Meaning I can use In to
render them invisible.

100
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,770
So you kept the chains out to trick us

101
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,310
into thinking they were real?

102
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,700
Precisely.

103
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,760
I pretended to be a Manipulator
using Nen-controlled chains,

104
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,150
so my enemies would only be
alert to the visible chains.

105
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,200
And my bluff just paid off.

106
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,200
While you were making empty threats,

107
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,330
my chains were already
wrapped around your body.

108
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,960
You've been captured.

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,720
Damn... But how?

110
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,140
He has an Enhancer's defensive power...

111
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,520
And the Nen in his conjured
chains is incredibly strong...

112
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:52,190
Has he fully mastered both
Enhancer and Conjurer techniques?

113
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,610
That's impossible.

114
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,990
Act

115
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,870
A Nen user can only fully master
their innate category.

116
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,870
Conjurer

117
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,870
Enhancer

118
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,180
I see you're having trouble understanding.

119
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,840
Let me illuminate you, before
sending you to the other side.

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,640
Those eyes...

121
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,640
I remember now.

122
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,180
There were a bunch of them,
in the middle of nowhere.

123
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,150
The boss really liked those eyes.

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,020
They were pretty strong!

125
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,280
Then, you're a survivor?

126
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm getting fired up...

127
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,360
Let's see which is stronger,

128
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,790
your grudge or my power!

129
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,750
Bastard...

130
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,170
Is that all you can think about?

131
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,550
You'll never be able to break these chains!

132
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,810
Why? What's wrong?

133
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,440
When my eyes turn scarlet,
I become a Specialist.

134
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,070
What was that?

135
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,030
When I am a Specialist,

136
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,390
I wield full control over
every category of Nen.

137
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,200
Emitter
Manipulator

138
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,200
Enhancer

139
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,200
Transmuter
Conjurer

140
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,320
And this is my power...

141
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,460
Absolute Mastery
Emperor Time

142
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,460
Emperor Time!

143
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,250
Chains?

144
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,150
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,

145
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,100
that was the first thing that came to mind.

146
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,260
Chains, huh...

147
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,690
Why's that?

148
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,170
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be

149
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,690
chained down to hell.

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
Really, now?

151
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,080
I get the feeling that you're
actually just chaining yourself.

152
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,250
What would you know?

153
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,670
Hey! Wait up!

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,580
I'm your teacher!

155
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,540
I'm not finished talking!

156
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,500
Hold it right there...

157
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,280
Didn't you hear my explanation?

158
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,440
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!

159
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,680
And conjuring unbreakable
chains is impossible!

160
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,600
Ignoring me?

161
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,100
Man, you're so stubborn.

162
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,610
It's impossible to conjure unbreakable chains.

163
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,360
But it's possible to conjure
something very close.

164
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Really?!

165
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,550
Yeah, you only hear what you want to hear.

166
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
What do I need?

167
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,120
A condition and a condition.

168
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,860
A condition and a condition?

169
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,340
Yes, determine a condition...

170
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,540
in other words, a rule...

171
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,890
and swear to always follow it.

172
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,140
The stricter the rule, the stronger
the power it will enable.

173
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,890
Normally, Nen is additive.

174
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:17,650
(Attack + Nen) x Condition Difficulty

175
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,380
But a Nen technique with
conditions is multiplicative.

176
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,170
Your strength will increase exponentially.

177
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,670
Come up with a rule for your chains.

178
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,550
One that you are prepared to follow.

179
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,640
But let me warn you...

180
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,530
This technique is very volatile.

181
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,670
It's a double-edged sword.

182
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,920
If you break the rule you set,
you could lose your Nen.

183
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,880
My objective is to find

184
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,670
my brethren's Scarlet Eyes

185
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,180
and to capture the spiders.

186
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,080
I want chains that are

187
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,630
unbreakable by the spiders,
the Phantom Troupe.

188
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,510
The spiders will be my only targets.

189
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,670
So the rule is that you will use these
chains solely for that objective?

190
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,190
That's a little weak.

191
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,770
Don't get ahead of me.

192
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,200
Using the chains exclusively on
spiders is only the prerequisite.

193
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Then what is your rule?

194
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,730
I'll stake my life on it!

195
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,090
Hey, Kurapika...

196
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,090
When your eyes are scarlet,
your aura spikes.

197
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,580
Could that mean...

198
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,490
Let's try water divination again!

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,850
A Specialist?

200
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,260
You have full control over
every other category?

201
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,850
That is correct.

202
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,620
Holy Chain: Healing Thumb

203
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,660
I can use enhanced self-healing

204
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,870
to completely recover a broken arm.

205
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,500
I shattered that arm,

206
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,270
but he healed it instantly.

207
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,260
There were a number of reasons why
I chose you to be my first target.

208
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,970
While you fought the Mafia
and the Shadow Beasts,

209
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,930
the other spiders stayed out of it altogether.

210
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,730
That told me you preferred to fight alone,

211
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,990
and that they trusted that
your strength would prevail.

212
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,990
I prefer to fight one-on-one.

213
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,240
That made you a perfect target.

214
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,870
An Enhancer who was confident
in his offense and defense.

215
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,260
You met every condition I
required for my first target.

216
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,860
Because then I could test if my Chain Jail

217
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,840
would be effective on the rest of the Troupe.

218
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,350
Chain Jail forcefully activates Zetsu
upon any Troupe member it ensnares.

219
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,940
It also paralyzes them.

220
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,410
So that's why I can't muster any aura...

221
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,870
Zetsu nullifies aura.

222
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,300
Meaning you'd need to use

223
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,800
physical strength alone to break these chains.

224
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,050
Damn!

225
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,930
If the Troupe member with the most
physical strength cannot break the chains,

226
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,430
the others will certainly be
unable to escape Chain Jail.

227
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,940
His forced activation of Zetsu here is bad...

228
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,270
Aura is the basis of all Nen.

229
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,520
If it's sealed off, you can't use your power.

230
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,600
A technique for sealing Nen...

231
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,980
This guy thought everything through.

232
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,220
It looks as though my enhanced fist

233
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,970
is slightly stronger than your physical brawn.

234
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,290
That's valuable information.

235
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,230
Then I can beat every Troupe member
barehanded, provided I've chained them.

236
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,480
Tell me everything you know.

237
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,800
Where are the other spiders?

238
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,990
Kill me.

239
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,000
What abilities do they have?

240
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,010
Kill me.

241
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,650
It makes me sick...

242
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,560
The sensation left on my hand.

243
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,170
The grating sound of each strike.

244
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,190
The smell of blood!

245
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,870
It all throws my senses into disarray...

246
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,170
How can you do these things,
yet feel and think nothing at all?!

247
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,930
Answer me!

248
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,670
Kill me.

249
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,610
This is your last chance.

250
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,810
I just placed a conditional
bond on your heart.

251
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,810
If you break the rule I set,

252
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,040
the bond will activate,

253
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,320
crushing your heart.

254
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,950
Judgment Chain:
Arbiter Little Finger

255
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,660
The rule is that

256
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,760
you must answer my question honestly.

257
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,860
Abide by that rule, and I shall
allow you to live a bit longer.

258
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,210
Where are the other spiders?!

259
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,760
Die, fool.

260
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,210
I spent too much time in that state...

261
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,140
It's me.

262
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,020
Kurapika, what's going on?

263
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,870
Why didn't you call?

264
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,910
Are you okay?

265
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,990
Yeah.

266
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,010
I'm glad to hear that...

267
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,010
What about on your side?

268
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,310
The boss is safe.
She's asleep in her room.

269
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,300
Right, the boss' father won't arrive

270
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,130
until late tonight, due to
weather complications.

271
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,340
I see.

272
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,790
I understand.

273
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,110
A chain user...

274
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,980
He's either a Manipulator or a Conjurer.

275
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,460
Uvogin is a dominant fighter.

276
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,260
But in a one-on-one fight, he is most
vulnerable to those two categories.

277
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,380
Many Conjurers give special powers

278
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,240
to the things that they create.

279
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,490
Some of those abilities could
render Uvo helpless.

280
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,090
And a Manipulator could
manipulate Uvo himself.

281
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,890
I should have tagged along!

282
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,640
Damn!

283
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,890
If he fails to return by dawn,

284
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,880
there will be a change in plans.

285
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,480
Shalnark senses the danger,
as Uvogin fails to return.

286
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
Their leader, Chrollo,

287
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,950
prepares to terminate the chain user.

288
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

289
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

290
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,940
Coming up, we have Gon

291
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,610
and Killua's

292
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,410
Hunterpedia!

293
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,750
It's Gon

294
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,490
and Killua's

295
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,730
Hunterpedia!

296
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:19,370
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

297
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,580
Today, we introduce Uvogin.

298
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,660
A Phantom Troupe member.

299
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,590
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

300
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,420
He has a giant body.

301
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
A master Enhancer,

302
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,260
His special attack is a Nen-infused straight right,

303
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,370
with the Troupe's
toughest, strongest body.

304
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,710
Big Bang Impact!

305
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,870
Next Time: Very x Sharp x Eye.

306
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,800
So sharp, it's like a razor.

307
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,650
Ooh, sounds great!
