00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,250
How—

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,180
Stop.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,220
...did you know?

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,820
What am I asking that for?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,180
It's time.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,760
Adding interest.

8
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,000
The Strong x And x The Weak

9
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,760
The time has finally come.

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,350
At long last...

11
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,280
Yep.

12
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,930
The King is about to be born!

13
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,410
Wait...

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,300
It's too early!

15
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,420
Silence!

16
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,070
I hunger.

17
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,010
Bring me food.

18
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,260
Th-This is our King...

19
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,050
Your Majesty!

20
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,740
O-Oh, no...

21
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,330
Her organs are severely damaged!

22
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,200
Do not make me repeat myself.

23
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,010
Bring me food.

24
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,200
This is a filthy place...

25
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,970
You...

26
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,230
Clean this off.

27
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,630
Ah, I happen to have a handkerchief on me—

28
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,460
Do not make me repeat myself.

29
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,080
I am speaking to you.

30
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,260
Clean this off.

31
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,330
Disgusting.

32
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,010
Where is my food?

33
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,120
This way, please.

34
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,610
We have prepared a meal for you.

35
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,930
The three of us will serve
as your arms and legs.

36
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,180
We shall acquire anything you wish...

37
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,810
And fulfill all of your desires.

38
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,310
We await your command.

39
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,750
Help the Queen!

40
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,420
Stop the bleeding!

41
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,050
Well? How is she?

42
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,110
It looks grim...

43
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,600
She's in very bad shape.

44
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:00,870
Multiple organs have been crushed
so badly, we cannot heal them!

45
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
If something isn't done...

46
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,610
Neferpitou-dono!

47
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,390
The Queen is dying...

48
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,870
We require your assistance!

49
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,600
We need the power you
used to heal that man!

50
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,500
I only healed him because I need him.

51
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,890
Now that the King has been born,

52
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,390
she means nothing to the Royal Guard.

53
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,650
She is no longer necessary.

54
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,040
Your Majesty!

55
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,960
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

56
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,640
Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?

57
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,130
No, Neferpitou-dono has...

58
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,230
No...

59
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,090
They have all abandoned the Queen.

60
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,880
Abandoned?

61
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,080
We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!

62
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,110
It's impossible!

63
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,590
Weren't you listening to me?

64
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,160
We don't have the power

65
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,210
to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...

66
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,600
Perhaps they have the power we need.

67
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,350
Who are you talking about?

68
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,110
Hey, where are you going?

69
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,400
We have prepared your dinner on the roof,
where there is a fine view.

70
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,200
Then, it would seem faster
to get there from outside.

71
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,500
Magnificent...

72
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,160
Excuse me.

73
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,680
That looks fun...

74
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,960
It seems I need practice.

75
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,790
Disgusting.

76
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,540
You don't like it?

77
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,990
It is horrendously bland.

78
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,350
We haven't been seasoning our food...

79
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,600
No, that is not what I mean.

80
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,450
When I was in her belly,

81
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,610
I was occasionally treated to
wonderfully rich, savory meals.

82
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,360
Ah, you must be talking
about the rare humans.

83
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,020
My body longs for that
indescribable satisfaction.

84
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,360
I wish to feast upon one of them.

85
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,120
As you wish.

86
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,470
In that case...

87
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,680
One of them is heading straight for us.

88
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,010
Have we been seen?

89
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,560
Let's hide...

90
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,180
Wait.

91
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,190
Something seems off...

92
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,020
Look!

93
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,990
A white flag?

94
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,040
We surrender!

95
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,970
We surrender!

96
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,050
But there is one condition...

97
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,490
You must save the Queen!

98
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,560
She no longer has the ability to give birth.

99
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,760
The Queen?

100
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,310
The King has already been born!

101
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,330
Impossible!

102
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,560
It's too early!

103
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,000
He is...

104
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,670
They are all

105
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,250
devils...

106
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,010
What is this?

107
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,380
They put up no fight.

108
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,370
Disgusting.

109
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,550
This is all wrong.

110
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,220
Might I offer some advice?

111
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,820
The brain is the most delicious part of a human.

112
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,630
So I'd recommend dispatching your
prey without harming the head.

113
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,480
Is that so?

114
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Like this?

115
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Magnificent!

116
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,720
I see... This is not so bad.

117
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,730
However...

118
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,480
It is still inedible,
when compared to a rare human.

119
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,480
Might I offer more advice?

120
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,970
There is a way to identify rare humans.

121
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,070
If you use—

122
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,490
Do you insult me?

123
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,770
I am aware

124
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,780
that if I focus, I can see the
energy around their bodies.

125
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,000
The volume of energy reveals their strength.

126
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,510
Please forgive my insolence.

127
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,020
Simply finding and consuming
them is not entertaining.

128
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
I enjoy the moments before eating,

129
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,520
before it is clear whether
the human is rare or not.

130
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,830
Since I have already alleviated my hunger.

131
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,530
Incidentally, Pitou...

132
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,570
You are quite strong.

133
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,120
I was trying to kill you.

134
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,530
You have earned my respect.

135
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,040
I am unworthy.

136
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,540
I don't believe it...

137
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,570
He ate a soldier... One of his own.

138
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,180
That isn't entirely correct.

139
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,550
He is a completely different organism.

140
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,560
I imagine he views all other creatures as food.

141
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,290
So what should we do now?

142
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,240
What do you mean?

143
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,680
If the Queen dies, we'll lose
our reason to stay here.

144
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,760
Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?

145
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,080
The Queen can no longer reproduce.

146
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,170
Huh?

147
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,130
That's true.

148
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,850
It's no longer possible for the
Queen to build her kingdom.

149
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,090
In that case, each of us should
try to become a king...

150
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,590
We can do as we please.

151
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,450
Do you realize what you're saying?

152
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,350
You think you can get away with this?

153
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm sure we aren't the only ones
who'd like to leave this place.

154
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,980
W-Wait...

155
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,580
Now do you see that you're in the minority?

156
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,390
Please... There's no time!

157
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,200
If the Queen dies,

158
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,090
there will be nothing to hold
the Squadron Leaders back.

159
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,640
Things will spin out of control.

160
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
What exactly will happen then?

161
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,150
Most likely, they will imitate the King.

162
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,650
They will leave to build their own
kingdoms by spreading their seed.

163
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,560
If the chain of command collapses,

164
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,780
some of the Captains will also strike out alone.

165
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,910
They will scatter throughout the world
and destroy entire ecosystems.

166
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,620
Are Chimera Ant soldiers
capable of reproduction?

167
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes...

168
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,670
They can copulate with females
of other species and reproduce.

169
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,970
Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen

170
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,800
will not attempt to reproduce.

171
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,920
But I've read reports

172
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,770
of soldiers attempting to reproduce
following a queen's death.

173
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,570
Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying.

174
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,570
What's your name?

175
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,570
Colt.

176
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,370
Colt, we're going to take you to our boss.

177
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,730
I need you to tell your story to him directly.

178
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,090
However,

179
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,710
I don't know if he will trust you.

180
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,090
And even if he believes your story,

181
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,100
he may not let you leave alive.

182
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,600
Are you still willing to come with us?

183
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,810
Absolutely! Time is of the essence!

184
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,240
The timing couldn't be worse.

185
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,870
Today is the day our disciples fight it out...

186
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,120
Oh! I completely forgot...

187
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,210
I bet 100,000 that Knuckle
and Shoot would make it.

188
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,150
You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come...

189
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,380
Knuckle...

190
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,150
Huh?

191
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,740
Promise me!

192
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,820
You have to...

193
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,590
You have to save Kite!

194
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,820
Got it...

195
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,670
I promise I'll bring him back.

196
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,670
Rook

197
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,680
I swear on this token.

198
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,670
Killua...

199
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm weak...

200
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,660
I never knew...

201
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,750
I never knew

202
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,980
how frustrating

203
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,460
weakness could be!

204
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,580
Gon...

205
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,340
For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...

206
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,340
I'll protect you.

207
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,590
I will do whatever it takes!

208
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,470
After that,

209
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,700
it's goodbye.

210
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,340
Next time: One Wish x And x Two Promises.

211
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,990
Hey, a shooting star!

212
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,180
May we always be together!
