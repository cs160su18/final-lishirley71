00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,480
What do we do, Zaikahal?

3
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,030
Evil x and x Terrible

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,240
His name is Gyro.

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,040
And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.

6
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,150
Gyro spent his first twelve years

7
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,300
in a construction camp.

8
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,950
By the time he said his first word,

9
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,800
he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete.

10
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,020
His father forced him to slave away...

11
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,420
until Gyro finally killed him and fled.

12
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,330
His father, who raised Gyro
alone, was a silent man.

13
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,010
When his father returned from work,

14
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,580
he drank cheap liquor by himself
until he went to bed.

15
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,740
He very rarely talked to Gyro,
who was on the upper bunk.

16
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,320
Thus, Gyro barely knew

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,170
how to speak before the age of seven.

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,280
When Gyro returned from work,

19
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,780
he was not permitted to leave his bed,

20
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,700
except when visiting the restroom.

21
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,810
He was allowed to relieve himself twice
a day, and only before 9 PM.

22
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,430
The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly
whenever he turned in his sleep.

23
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,420
His father hated that sound.

24
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,540
After his father once severely
beat him because of that noise,

25
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,090
Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,720
He also learned to control his bladder at night,

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,110
keeping an empty liquor bottle
for when he couldn't hold it.

28
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,800
"Don't make trouble for others."

29
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,620
That was the one lesson his
silent father taught him.

30
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,430
From a young age, Gyro did
his best to adhere to it,

31
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,240
learning from his mistakes.

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,040
Since his father had never
bought him even one toy,

33
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,140
this lesson was his one and
only gift from his father.

34
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,750
Within his small world,
his father was essentially God.

35
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,190
And no matter how cruel his father could be,

36
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,420
Gyro continued to idolize him,

37
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,300
believing that his father needed him.

38
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,160
This belief stemmed from two facts...

39
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,660
When Gyro was five,

40
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,250
a terrible fever nearly killed him.

41
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,610
All night, his father stayed up,
replacing his towels with fresh ones.

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,670
And the other reason was...

43
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,280
that his father had never
once ordered him to leave.

44
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,500
Gyro was proud of these two facts.

45
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,540
"Idiot...

46
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,940
He hasn't kicked you out
because you bring in money!"

47
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,730
Though he had previously kept that
possibility locked away deep in his mind,

48
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,790
Gyro snapped when the older youth
insensitively brought it to light.

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,570
Regretting that he'd revealed his secret,
Gyro was furious with himself.

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,800
His pride wounded, rage overcame
him, and he attacked the youth.

51
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,830
The youth had always mocked the timid boy,

52
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,520
so when the boy fought back,
he went mad with anger,

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,270
to the point where not even
knocking him out would satisfy him.

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
He stomped on the boy's face,

55
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,280
spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:

56
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,530
"When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!

57
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,410
Your old man was drinking by himself as always.

58
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,370
You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this.

59
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,960
But that night, the neighbor had
a fight with your old man.

60
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,000
He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.

61
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,830
Let me tell you what your old man said.

62
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,300
It wouldn't matter.

63
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,810
I don't care if he dies.

64
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,480
You hear that?"

65
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,670
As Gyro listened to the youth,

66
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,820
he witnessed something inconceivable.

67
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
His father looked him in the eye,

68
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,370
paid him no attention, and then left.

69
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,180
That was when Gyro finally understood.

70
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,410
The universe doesn't give a damn about me.

71
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,820
My father doesn't care if I live or die.

72
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,850
In other words, my life has no meaning.

73
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,380
If I live, I'll bring in money.

74
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,870
If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all.

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,880
My father told me not to
make trouble for others

76
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,910
so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.

77
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,090
It was never a lesson to help his son.

78
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,080
It was fully for his own benefit.

79
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,500
In that lesson, "others" meant my father.

80
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,400
No...

81
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,280
It meant "humans."

82
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Don't make trouble for humans.

83
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,390
I must not be human...

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Eventually, the boy stood up,

85
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,050
grabbing a nearby hammer.

86
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,020
Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL.

87
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,670
Nine years after that, NGL became
a nation, with him as its king.

88
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,020
Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.

89
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,020
The drug D² was merely the first step.

90
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,930
Yunju!

91
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,220
You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.

92
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,300
I didn't feel like fighting.

93
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,470
Either way, the food will reach the Queen.

94
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,560
I just want to enjoy the hunt.

95
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,560
Gyro...

96
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,650
Damn, I should have just eaten him!

97
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,200
Listen up!

98
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,070
I'm taking over this factory!

99
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,310
From today on, this is my fortress!

100
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,260
This is awesome!

101
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,040
This is bad.

102
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,710
These creatures are too dangerous!

103
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,770
Look!

104
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
What...

105
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,180
What is happening in this place?

106
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,110
What? More dead soldiers found?

107
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered.

108
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,370
Plus, one of mine is missing...

109
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,400
Its communication has been cut
off, and it hasn't returned.

110
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,610
Yunju's team dealt with the
humans holding guns.

111
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,040
Does this mean there are other
humans who are resisting us?

112
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,580
Sounds that way...

113
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,890
But the dead soldiers were killed
by something that wasn't a gun.

114
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,210
Something?

115
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,390
What could it have been?

116
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,580
How would I know?

117
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,390
Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.

118
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,190
Where are the corpses?

119
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,400
Peggy's examining them above.

120
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,400
This one was killed by a gun.

121
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.

122
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,910
But I'm not sure about the others.

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,430
The skull was punctured.

124
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,920
Yes, but not by a gun.

125
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,640
And I had difficulty understanding

126
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,940
the soldiers' explanation of the events...

127
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,430
As it is, the foot soldiers' communications
are simplistic and just to the point.

128
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,550
They said one human mimicked firing
a gun, and no projectile emerged,

129
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,930
but something pierced the
soldier's skulls and they fell, dead.

130
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,780
Can't some soldiers both see
and feel what's happening?

131
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,380
You're correct.

132
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,200
Those soldiers said that they
felt a projectile being fired.

133
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,650
So they possess abilities that we do not...

134
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,080
These humans could prove tougher
opponents than anticipated.

135
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,840
If humans have this power, once we
inherit their genes, we also will.

136
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,550
We only lack the trait.

137
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
You don't understand...

138
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,340
The humans' strength lies
in their ability to learn.

139
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,840
If they learn that the Queen
is where we're vulnerable,

140
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,750
they'll do whatever it takes to kill her.

141
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,850
Hmm?

142
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,570
You're the one who doesn't understand!

143
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,110
That just means we need to do
whatever it takes to keep her safe.

144
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,860
Am I wrong?

145
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,870
No, you're correct...

146
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,620
That's right.

147
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,730
I will protect her...

148
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,630
I will protect Reina!

149
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,880
Reina?

150
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,840
Who's Reina?

151
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,520
Uh, you're the one who said that name!

152
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,390
I did?

153
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,780
I didn't say anything.

154
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,430
You must be hearing things.

155
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,140
Anyway,

156
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,960
the problem is that humans
possess multiple weapons

157
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,180
capable of defeating our foot soldiers.

158
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,150
What should we do?

159
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,400
Use their weapons against them.

160
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,160
Give them a taste of their own medicine.

161
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,160
Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity
to manipulate complex weaponry.

162
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,990
But the humans don't know that.

163
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,600
They must be very frightened.

164
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,170
I understand...

165
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
You're a better strategist than I am.

166
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,100
Reina?

167
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,150
It didn't work...

168
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,650
No one received the message.

169
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,910
That means all the other Hunters I was
in contact with have been taken out.

170
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,690
Oh...

171
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,910
We should leave.

172
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,410
Those creatures are too much for us to handle.

173
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,670
We need to leave NGL and tell
the world what's happening...

174
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,220
So that an extermination force can be formed.

175
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,180
Whatever... Let's just run for it!

176
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,430
Or we'll all be—

177
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,320
I-It's here!

178
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,250
Run!

179
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,930
More will be coming!

180
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,230
Hold on, now...

181
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,800
I said to capture the humans alive.

182
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,510
We're supposed to deliver
them to the Queen fresh.

183
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,500
A-A human face...

184
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,010
What is that thing?!

185
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,150
Fire...

186
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,760
Open fire!

187
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,770
Orange Arrow

188
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,020
He grabbed my Orange Arrow,

189
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,860
fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease.

190
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,260
Huh? This is clearly visible.

191
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,370
The grunts couldn't see this?

192
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,390
So the life energy

193
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,630
that surrounds your body is
what fuels this weapon?

194
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,130
You will make a magnificent
meal for the Queen...

195
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,690
Balda!

196
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,340
O-Oh, no!

197
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,960
I took a bite without thinking...

198
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,840
Zazan-sama will be angry again!

199
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,550
You bastard!

200
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,390
O-One moment...

201
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,600
My hands are full.

202
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,270
Take this!

203
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,090
As always, you're a disgrace in battle.

204
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,280
Zazan-sama...

205
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,450
Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?

206
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,870
Oh!

207
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,130
You're right.

208
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,800
We're going back.

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,460
Hmm?

210
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,960
Since we've obtained some excellent food.

211
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,680
He probably has the nutritional value
of a thousand normal humans.

212
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,090
Well done, Pike.

213
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,850
Zazan-sama!

214
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,000
I am most grateful for your praise...

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,470
You honor me!

216
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,890
Don't forget the food.

217
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,990
Oh, yes...

218
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,400
I can't save him myself...

219
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,720
I have to call for help!

220
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,350
There's still... There's still time!

221
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,910
Even if they take him, they
won't eat him immediately...

222
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,180
Please...

223
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,040
Find a Hunter with a strong aura!

224
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,940
I must hurry back to the border!

225
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,070
Other Hunters should be there—

226
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,100
So much fun...

227
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,560
Hunting is so much fun!

228
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Help!!

229
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,750
Help!!
Chimera Ant Nest

230
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,750
Rocky Area

231
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,750
Notify the Hunter Association!!

232
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,710
It'll be dangerous.

233
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,520
But could you accompany me?

234
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,610
Of course.

235
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,620
We're pros.

236
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,150
Miss interpreter...

237
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,690
Sorry, but we're in a hurry.

238
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,370
Yes.

239
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,830
The horses can move a bit faster.

240
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,520
They won't be fast enough.

241
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,670
I want you two to return to
the border, find the others,

242
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,670
and get word to the Association.

243
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,620
These creatures are dangerous.

244
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,720
Got it.

245
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,670
Be careful, Kite.

246
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,770
Right.

247
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,180
If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind.

248
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,440
Right back at you.

249
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,180
All ready to go!

250
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,730
Let's go.

251
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,100
This is a bullet casing.

252
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,860
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?

253
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,770
So the underground rulers of NGL

254
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,260
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.

255
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,810
But judging by this...

256
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,370
It wasn't done by a human.

257
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,800
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.

258
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,630
If the Chimera Ants are using guns...

259
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,790
I hate to consider the possibility,

260
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,500
but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers

261
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,170
have already been fed to the queen...

262
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,060
What will happen if Chimera Ants
are born with their genes?

263
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,490
NGL and Chimera Ants...

264
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,920
The worst combination imaginable.

265
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,170
This could create an unprecedented biohazard.

266
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,840
The situation has taken a sudden
turn for the absolute worst.

267
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,260
Next time: The x Fight x Begins.

268
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,620
Ready...

269
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,510
Set...

270
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,550
Gon!
