2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,940
I have to defeat him,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,820
or it's all over!

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,990
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!

5
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,990
Friend x And x Journey

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,790
Determined to protect Gon

7
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,430
for the thirty days he can't use Nen,

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,020
Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.

9
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
However...

10
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,730
Run.

11
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,680
Yes! That's more like it!

12
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,520
That terrified expression...

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,360
I love it!

14
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,050
Damn, I'm getting excited now...

15
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,310
I'm gonna tear you apart.

16
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,240
If you aren't certain you can win, run.

17
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,690
I have to protect him... I have to...

18
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,320
When you know nothing of your opponent...

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,280
...protect Gon.

20
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,550
...run away.

21
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,780
No matter what!

22
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,240
Is there something special about that tree?

23
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,430
Just wait a little longer.

24
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,200
Amazing...

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,550
They're seaside fireflies.

26
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,360
They're only found around brackish water,

27
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,100
and this is their breeding season.

28
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,880
It's beautiful!

29
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,770
Isn't it?

30
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,580
You piss yourself or something?

31
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,070
Well?!

32
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,330
Can't even move a muscle?

33
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,980
Lose your spine?

34
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,190
Damn, this feels so good...

35
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,620
Should I kill him?

36
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,710
Ah, but I want to enjoy this!

37
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,570
Here.

38
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,320
It's a present.

39
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,330
This is the most beautiful flower in the world.

40
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,830
It is?

41
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
Stay still.

42
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,450
The tree's sap is very similar to
the pheromones fireflies emit,

43
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,240
so they tend to gather around branches.

44
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,550
I'm so happy...

45
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,370
Thank you.

46
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,810
Really?

47
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,650
I'm glad to hear that.

48
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
But I...

49
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,390
I can't give you what you truly want.

50
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,800
What I truly want?

51
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,020
Time alone with me.

52
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,400
Eh?

53
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,400
I...

54
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,410
I want to become stronger.

55
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,380
Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.

56
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,410
That means I have to train harder.

57
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,230
In two days, Kite's coming back.

58
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,590
But it sounds like he's under enemy control.

59
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,220
To return him to normal, I'll probably
have to fight whoever is controlling him.

60
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,480
So until Kite is back to normal...

61
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,400
Or if possible, until the
Chimera Ants are defeated...

62
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,890
I want to focus on my training.

63
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,530
Yes... Yes!

64
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,410
Are you okay with that?

65
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,500
Huh?

66
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,960
What was that?

67
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,970
Damn! I can't get enough!

68
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,270
Run...

69
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,280
Hurry.

70
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,830
No...

71
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,110
Gon!

72
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,370
I will...

73
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,620
...protect you.

74
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,090
Because

75
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,980
we're friends...

76
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,890
You're my dear friend!

77
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,080
Stop that...

78
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,230
Don't look at me like that.

79
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,300
I c-can't stop myself...

80
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,660
I'll kill you.

81
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll kill you! I'll kill you...

82
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,030
Run.

83
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,360
Shut up!

84
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,290
Run.

85
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,680
I won't listen to you!

86
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,800
Run... Run... Run...

87
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,530
Shut up!

88
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,160
I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!

89
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,430
Run.

90
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,470
I don't want

91
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,440
to lose him!

92
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,360
Run.

93
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,660
Gon is...

94
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,450
Run.

95
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,200
...my...

96
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,450
Run.

97
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,530
...dear...

98
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,500
Run.

99
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,790
It has to be Killua.

100
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,010
My very dear friend!

101
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,590
He disappeared?

102
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,040
He fooled me good.

103
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,760
Illumi must have planted this

104
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,760
inside my head.

105
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,710
Huh? What are you talking about?

106
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,470
Have you lost your mind?

107
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,770
And how did you dodge that?

108
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,270
Wait, I saw the whole thing.

109
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,850
Right before I reached him,

110
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,700
he jammed his finger into his own head.

111
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,620
And then he vanished,

112
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,830
before popping up over there.

113
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah, I feel so much better now.

114
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm completely awake now.

115
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.

116
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,600
That's all that happened! Nothing more...

117
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,810
This can't be happening!

118
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,060
Now I'm the one who's afraid?!

119
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,960
I have a message for the other Ants.

120
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,750
If you come anywhere near us,

121
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,500
your lives are over.

122
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,990
That's bull!

123
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,710
Very well.

124
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,100
Then don't bother.

125
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,520
They're gone.

126
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,580
Their stuff's still here...

127
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,630
Were other Ants nearby?

128
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,720
I don't sense any.

129
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,140
That means...

130
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,910
What are you doing?!

131
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,150
Eh? Can't you tell?

132
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm punishing him.

133
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,420
Punishing him for toying with my feelings!

134
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,390
What the hell?

135
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,170
You're the one who's being unreasonable!

136
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,680
Well, at least he's okay...

137
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,080
Leave us alone!
This is none of your business!

138
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,590
Right back at you, stupid.

139
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,380
Why don't you make yourself scarce?

140
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,200
Why are you injured?

141
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,280
Huh?

142
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,200
Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?

143
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,180
I'll injure you some more!

144
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,010
Palm...

145
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,670
Don't bother.

146
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,340
I could dodge your knife in my sleep.

147
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,170
I was so sure he was dead....

148
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,810
Wait!

149
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,530
I'll kill you!

150
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,120
What?

151
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,120
Catch us if you can, stupid!

152
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,260
Wait!

153
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,300
Stop, Killua...

154
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,550
You're just making her angrier.

155
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,410
Huh?

156
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,090
If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.

157
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,140
We just have to call Knuckle and tell
him we'll meet him somewhere else.

158
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,390
I'm going back.

159
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,330
Do you want to die?

160
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,430
If you let your guard down

161
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,420
thinking she's not much of a fighter,
she'll stab you in the back!

162
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,780
She wouldn't do that.

163
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,710
Huh?!

164
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,230
Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?

165
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,470
Damn, you're too much!

166
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,060
They're making a fool of me!

167
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,840
They think they've escaped me?

168
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,310
Fools!

169
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,350
Wherever you run to, I will know!

170
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,990
Cute, cute mermaid...

171
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,170
Where is that accursed brat, Killua?

172
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,890
There he is, the fool!

173
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,180
The hotel by the station...

174
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,090
Brat...

175
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,420
Brat! Brat! Brat!

176
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,680
He keeps interfering!

177
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,950
If not for him, everything would be fine.

178
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,450
I'll chase him to the end of
the world and eliminate him!

179
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,060
Make a fool of me, will you?!

180
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,840
Kno—

181
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,150
Knov-sama...

182
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,590
Where did those boys go?

183
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,170
R-Right...

184
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,590
They went to the hotel that
has a logo with three circles.

185
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,810
This is Knov.

186
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,730
They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.

187
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,760
Yeah, we just got a call from them.

188
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,240
Um, I believe you had planned
to arrive in two days...

189
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,890
No, we're on schedule.

190
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,990
We'll use the extra two days
to observe those boys,

191
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,920
to determine if they're ready to
see Kite in his current state.

192
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,580
But first things first, Palm!

193
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,650
Y-Yes?

194
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,440
It appears that you used your
power without my permission.

195
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,760
I told you to await my orders,
in case of unforeseen events.

196
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,380
Yes...

197
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,770
Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.

198
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,560
Irreplaceable?

199
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,870
Use it only for me.

200
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,530
Only for Knov-sama...

201
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,560
Understood?

202
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,790
Y-Yes.

203
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,260
Knov-sama really is the only one for me!

204
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,050
And why are you dressed like that?

205
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,700
Oh! No reason...

206
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,680
N-Nothing's going on!

207
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,110
Irreplaceable...

208
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,060
Then tell her to wait until
Kite's back to normal.

209
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,140
I did.

210
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,490
Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,

211
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,290
forced into a relationship by Palm
Siberia, age 22, blood type A...

212
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,700
and dumped before he knew it.

213
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,750
Meh... Again?

214
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,810
That's the third one.

215
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,810
Oh! A secret one!

216
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,750
Huh? Really?

217
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,920
Yeah, you can auction it on
the net for a lot of money.

218
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,320
Then you can have it.

219
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,330
Not interested.

220
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,710
Did something happen?

221
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,690
Hmm? Not really.

222
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,090
Let's hit the gym.

223
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,930
Okay!

224
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,580
Well?

225
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,770
Oh, I haven't noticed anything.

226
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,140
They seem to be doing fine...

227
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,510
But we should continue to observe them.

228
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,100
That will give them time to
conclude their business.

229
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,600
While Knov and Shoot were observing
the mental state of Gon and Killua...

230
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,180
He's here.

231
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,580
Who's this guy?

232
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,560
Not bad.

233
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,930
He's fast.

234
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,150
You're faster than the guys
I fought yesterday.

235
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,040
But not by much.

236
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,380
Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.

237
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,720
Give me more meat!

238
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,090
You eat a lot.

239
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,130
Bitter much?

240
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,010
You mean, "Jealous much?"
