00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,460
I'm not big on formalities,

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,490
so call me Bisky.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,470
In return, you must obey every
word of what I teach you.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,740
No way. And no, thanks.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,480
We're not desperate enough to beg
a total stranger to train us!

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Say something, Gon.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,750
We have Wing-san.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,000
Right, right.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,850
We already have a master,

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,010
and we don't need anyone else to teach us.

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,590
Wing?

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,270
You mean that little boy with
messy hair and glasses?

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,320
The one who never tucks in his shirt?

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
Do you know him?

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,330
Do I know him?

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,150
Wing's one of my students.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,180
Seriously?

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,150
That's awesome!

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,980
So he's become a master now...

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,440
Time really flies, huh?

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,450
Does that mean you're pro Hunters?

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,160
Oh, just me.

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,030
You've passed the secret exam?

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,040
Yep.

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,560
That really takes me back...

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,050
I'd love to serve as an examiner again.

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,180
Well, I'm essentially your master's master,

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,340
so you shouldn't have any
problems with my teaching you.

31
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,060
A x Hard x Master

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,770
Wow!

33
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,480
You've been an examiner!

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,690
Assuming that she's telling the truth.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,330
You're a stubborn little boy.

36
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,440
I like to see that in kids.

37
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,270
You said that you weren't desperate, right?

38
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,800
Book.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,580
That card...

40
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Marimo-chi
A super-fast ball-like
creature about as hard
as rubber. Deals little
damage, but can be
annoying if it smacks
you in the face.

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,050
Look carefully.

42
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,800
Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,580
It's a normal card that doesn't
go in a restricted slot.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,330
The problem is that

45
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,900
there are many people who
could have effortlessly

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,090
obtained this card, while you two could not.

47
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,850
If you run into someone who's
stronger and has evil intentions...

48
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,850
Sit down...
Pretend that we're chatting.

49
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,110
There's an enemy behind me.

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,420
Three kids?

51
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,700
I'll cut them apart.

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,460
Don't probe for him.

53
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,330
He'll notice.

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,830
How did you sense him?

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,340
He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.

56
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,590
The enemy saw a bunch of kids,
and he relaxed for a second.

57
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,090
Doesn't that mean he's weak?

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,660
He immediately concealed his presence again.

59
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,980
It was only the slightest bloodlust,
and he quickly concealed it,

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,600
so he's pretty good.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,810
We couldn't even sense his presence,
let alone locate him.

62
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,360
What should we do?

63
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,590
He's fast on the uptake!

64
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,120
This boy's bright.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
What do you think?

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
We three should move together.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,220
Why do you say that?

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,470
I'm guessing he decided to use caution

69
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,630
because there are three of us.

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,210
If we stick together,
he'll be less eager to attack.

71
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,380
I agree.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,130
Well, you're right.

73
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,820
But that's not what we're going to do.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,950
If I go off on my own,

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,840
the enemy is one hundred percent
guaranteed to attack me.

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,790
I'll go south. You boys, go north.

77
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,770
Walk five hundred meters without
concealing your presences.

78
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,460
Aim for that pillar.

79
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,650
Once you get there, use Zetsu,
then rush back immediately!

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,660
Okay, stalk the stalker—

81
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,620
Huh?

82
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,270
Fine, then! Be that way!

83
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,620
Damned hag...

84
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,910
I've had enough!

85
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,100
Bye-bye.

86
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,550
Yeah, get lost!

87
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,150
We didn't want you around!

88
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,130
Come on, Gon!

89
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's go.

90
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,140
Oh, they're acting.

91
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,560
So long, stupid!

92
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,160
That woman really is something.

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,770
Huh?

94
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,040
I was on full alert,

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,030
so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
But I didn't realize what she'd done

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,160
until my cheek began to sting.

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's hurry back.

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
Yeah.

100
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,680
I just cut your hair...

101
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,100
With my Scissor Hands!

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:28,660
When I eat the hair I cut,

103
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,350
I can learn things about the owner's body

104
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,020
that they don't even know about themselves.

105
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,800
Muscle tone, potential for
disease, genetic strengths!

106
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,210
I will learn everything about your body

107
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,970
before I begin to toy with it...

108
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,300
Age fifty-seven?!

109
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,190
And she looks like this?

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,690
What's even scarier is how honed her body is.

111
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,440
I can see

112
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,440
her physical appearance conceals

113
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,200
the strength she's achieved

114
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
through intensive training.

115
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,830
My fighter's spirit insists that
I challenge you to a duel.

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,630
I guess you aren't a total deviant.

117
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,210
Very well.

118
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,620
You're lucky.

119
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,280
If I'd used my Nen, you would be dead.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,750
During that battle, what did you see first?

121
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,160
The guy being flipped through the air.

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,380
Same here.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,630
Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.

124
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,130
She's just that strong!

125
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,800
If he were an in-game character,

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,640
he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty.

127
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,140
It would have been an instant
game over for you boys.

128
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,780
That makes the second time

129
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,590
I've seen you barely escape death.

130
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,590
How long will your good fortune last?

131
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,280
Bisky-san...

132
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,500
Just call me Bisky.

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,990
If you insist on an honorific,

134
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,870
call me Bisky-chama!

135
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,790
I'll just call you Hag.

136
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,290
Why are you here, Bisky?

137
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,090
Well, I'm here to clear the game,

138
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,010
but I'm mainly after a jewel.

139
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,920
A jewel?

140
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,220
There's a jewel that can only be found here.

141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,810
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

142
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,670
It goes in restricted slot #81...

143
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,300
Blue Planet.

144
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,810
What about you boys?

145
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,660
We're here to clear the game, obviously.

146
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,130
Actually, my dad made this game.

147
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,320
Oh?

148
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,460
I'm looking for my dad,

149
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,140
so I thought this game might contain a lead.

150
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,180
Who's your dad?

151
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,330
Ging Freecss.

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
Ging?!

153
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,730
You know him?

154
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,080
You bet I do!

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,970
He's famous.

156
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,050
Chairman Netero once said

157
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,840
he was one of the top five Nen users...

158
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,340
Bisky, if you'd be willing to
postpone your treasure hunt,

159
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,600
please teach us Nen!

160
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,900
You've finally come around?

161
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,980
I'm a lot tougher than Wing.

162
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,820
Are you ready?

163
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,780
Yes!

164
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,040
What about you?

165
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,180
I'll be fine.

166
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,250
Take out all your cards.

167
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,230
Book.

168
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,250
I'm going to give you a chance.

169
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,250
You must evade their attacks for two weeks!

170
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,910
If you're successful, I'll let you escape.

171
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,630
If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...

172
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,610
I will kill you.

173
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,410
I just have to avoid their attacks, right?

174
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,160
It doesn't matter what I do to them?

175
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,270
Sure.

176
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,180
But there's one rule.

177
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,620
You aren't allowed to leave this crater.

178
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,140
If you break this rule, you lose,

179
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,600
and I'll kill you.

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,780
What about us?

181
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,140
The same rules apply.

182
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,040
If you leave, or fail to defeat
him after two weeks,

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,710
you'll be punished.

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,020
You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?

185
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,820
Yeah.

186
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,050
There's a bounty on his head, as well.

187
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,510
He's a brutal murderer.

188
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,040
Begin!

189
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,790
Why are you standing around?

190
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,430
He's trying to heal up!

191
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,130
Are you going to let him?

192
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,800
If he weren't injured,

193
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,210
I would have lost my eye!

194
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,550
We can't get close to him...

195
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,390
Should I use this?

196
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,560
But while I charge up, he won't stay still.

197
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,390
Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition.

198
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,690
Attrition?

199
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,670
You get some rest.

200
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,310
I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack.

201
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,950
We'll switch every six hours.

202
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,620
Rocks?

203
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,050
That's a good idea.

204
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,490
That's exactly what I need...

205
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,890
If I can rest like this for a week,
I'll be more or less recovered.

206
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,460
Once I'm healed, I can finish them off.

207
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,690
He's using the rock as a shield!

208
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,800
Correct!

209
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,570
You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.

210
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,160
Makes sense.

211
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,650
Damn!

212
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,470
They have too much stamina!

213
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,190
I won't have any time to rest!

214
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,900
Binolt may be injured,

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,590
but making him uncomfortable
in half a day is still impressive.

216
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,200
They're conscious that their lives
are on the line in this fight.

217
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,870
Not bad at all.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,930
These boys are raw gems!

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,290
That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.

220
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,710
That hidden, bottomless potential.

221
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,310
If properly cut through training,
he can be completely transformed...

222
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,330
Like a diamond!

223
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,180
And this boy is a cool, calm blue.

224
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,340
He may look fragile,

225
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,930
but with the right amount of heat, he can
achieve semi-permanent strength...

226
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,110
Like a sapphire!

227
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,960
Why does my heart skip

228
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,200
whenever I see something
waiting to be polished?

229
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,990
I'll train them well!

230
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,530
What?

231
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,350
A forest of rocks.

232
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,530
It impedes their enemy,
while concealing their presences.

233
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,000
This won't take two weeks.
They'll finish it in a day.

234
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,230
Game over, pops!

235
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,690
Stop, Killua!

236
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,990
Why did you stop me, Gon?

237
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,890
We still have plenty of time.

238
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,860
Let's continue until we're both
able to take him alone.

239
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,830
Huh?

240
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,340
Stopping now would be a waste.

241
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,580
Because we're on a roll.

242
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,590
Fool...

243
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,000
It's my turn.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll slice you up!

245
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,720
Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow.

246
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,060
You should get some rest.

247
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,350
You've been slowing down.

248
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,590
True.

249
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,170
If it takes both of us to beat a single
injured, exhausted man,

250
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,730
we won't stand a chance
against any of the rest.

251
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,470
You won't be able to fool their
acute antennae now.

252
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,580
Binolt, your potential pales
in comparison to theirs.

253
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh, my wallet's missing.

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,520
Really? You had it a moment ago.

255
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,770
Excuse me...

256
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,520
You dropped this...

257
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,040
Day two...

258
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,700
He's slowing down.

259
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,220
No, we're getting faster.

260
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,690
Practice pays off that much more

261
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,630
when you're fighting an equal for your life.

262
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,580
Damn...

263
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,330
Damn!

264
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,840
I never...

265
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,590
I never wanted

266
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,620
to live this way!

267
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,850
That's why I was against this!

268
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,970
You're the one who said
this would be a shortcut.

269
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,870
Now it's my fault?

270
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,230
Look at my clothes...
They're dirty now.

271
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,350
I wasn't looking for a reward...

272
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,630
I wasn't expecting any gratitude...

273
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,740
I just...

274
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,120
That's enough.

275
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
There's no way I can defeat you.

276
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,340
Kill me.

277
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,820
Why? We won't kill you.

278
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,130
You've helped us make a lot of progress.

279
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,010
Thank you, Binolt-san!

280
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,360
I only wanted

281
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,770
to lead a normal life.

282
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,410
Go on.

283
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,910
Once I leave, I'll turn myself in.

284
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,160
Gon...

285
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,140
You're flawless,

286
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,030
a perfect gem.

287
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,840
But that pure nature could be your undoing.

288
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,280
Well, let's head for Masadora.

289
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,290
Osu!

290
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,420
The number 9!

291
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,530
Too slow!

292
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,550
Give me three thousand push-ups.

293
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,860
Damn...

294
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,280
Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.

295
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,810
That's a three-hour trip, at most.

296
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,060
Seriously?

297
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,450
Oh, there it is!

298
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,950
City of Magic
Masadora

299
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,950
Let's find a department store now!

300
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,340
They're only selling cards...

301
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,690
Sorry for the wait.

302
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,250
Let's return to that rocky area.

303
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,960
What?!

304
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,010
Gain!

305
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,010
These are the cards you bought?

306
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,970
Yep.

307
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,920
We'll head back to Masadora now.

308
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,420
However,

309
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,940
we'll go in a straight line!

310
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,970
Huh? A straight line?

311
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,100
You can't mean...

312
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,640
Yep!

313
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
It's time to dig!

314
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,470
The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.

315
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,240
Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly.

316
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,070
This is rough...

317
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,050
No more...

318
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,850
Hold on.

319
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,420
If you're going to rest, sit properly.

320
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,470
Huh?

321
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,050
Starting today, you must always
sleep in this position.

322
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,740
Don't let go of the rope.

323
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,750
There's a chance I might cut the rope,

324
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,360
so keep a portion of your
brain alert while you sleep.

325
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,300
My old man put me through this
kind of training all the time.

326
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,890
Ow!

327
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,820
Okay, when it falls,
you have to put it back up.

328
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,840
Gon, your head...

329
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,300
I'm good...

330
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,180
I'll be making them bigger.

331
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,540
Gon...

332
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm good!

333
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,980
Ow!

334
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,530
We've run into a really hard rock.

335
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,950
Can we dig it up?

336
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,990
I don't think a shovel will work.

337
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,330
I can probably break it with a Nen punch.

338
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,290
What's wrong?

339
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,610
Killua, what were you doing with
your aura while digging?

340
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,920
I wasn't doing anything unusual.

341
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,680
Think of the shovel as part of your body!

342
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,680
I see.

343
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,580
If we shroud the shovel in aura,
our digging will be stronger!

344
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,440
Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!

345
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,850
Okay! Let's keep on digging!

346
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,490
They've learned a new application of Ten, Shu!

347
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,860
Surround

348
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,860
Once we reach Masadora,
they'll have completed the first stage.

349
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,580
How will Bisky's grueling training
transform the two boys?

350
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:07,650
G.I. Tutorial

351
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,750
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

352
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,090
Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet.

353
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:18,750
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.

354
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,930
It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.

355
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,430
She's going through all this just for a stone?

356
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,550
That hag has weird taste...

357
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,170
Continue!

358
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,630
Next time: Strengthen x And x Threaten.

359
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,880
Strengthen!

360
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,930
Ahem!

361
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,100
Don't threaten!

362
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,430
Ahem!
