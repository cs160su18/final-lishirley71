2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,080
Neferpitou.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,730
Huh?

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,980
That is the name the Queen gave me.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,650
From now on, call me Neferpitou.

6
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,990
Light x And x Darkness

7
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,700
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains...

8
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,580
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,910
Commander Neferpitou will hold

10
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,510
an award ceremony in auditorium one.

11
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,450
If you are able to endure considerable pain,

12
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,260
you will receive tremendous power in return.

13
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,620
That power is to be used for our Queen!

14
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,780
They're continuing to go straight.

15
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,790
The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.

16
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,930
Amazing...

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,870
He's been picking them up this entire time,
never losing them for an instant.

18
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,920
Kite said he could use En within
a radius of forty-five meters.

19
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,950
I've heard that those called Nen masters
can handle around fifty meters.

20
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,730
Kite is nearly there.

21
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,300
Actually, given that he's kept
it up for an entire night,

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,670
he's probably stronger.

23
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,190
Stronger than a master...

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,230
Then Kite's the real deal.

25
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,700
Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met.

26
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,950
Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,

27
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,110
but we really only knew him
as another player in a game.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,460
Bisky was an incredible Hunter.

29
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,420
But to us...

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,920
Yeah, she was our Nen mentor.

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,220
And the first to teach us about Nen...

32
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
Wing-san was our Nen master and savior.

33
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,910
Looking back,

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,240
we always meet the right people
just when we need them most.

35
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,740
And those people have all made us stronger.

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,220
Razor, too, huh?

37
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,990
Yeah.

38
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,370
It's clear that Ging really did create
Greed Island to train you.

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,630
And once you beat the game,
he deliberately led you to Kite.

40
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,250
Ging!

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm not sure if Ging predicted what
would happen when we met Kite.

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,900
But he certainly knew

43
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,830
that you would like the man who
had earned Ging's respect.

44
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,220
And he knew without doubt
that you would go with Kite.

45
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,920
He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.

46
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,420
This is a pretty brutal place for training, though.

47
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,550
That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.

48
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,560
As you mentioned,

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,060
Ging-san probably had certain
expectations when he sent you to me.

50
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,510
But I do not intend to train
you during this journey.

51
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,940
We don't have that kind of time.

52
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,320
I brought you along because I
thought you might be of use.

53
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,940
From here, it all comes down to your resolve.

54
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,990
If it's strong, you'll develop your Nen
and grow strong via combat.

55
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,170
If it's weak, the Ants will eat you.

56
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,150
But we can't die...

57
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,680
We are pro Hunters.

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,430
Those who call themselves
Hunters always get their prey.

59
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,920
For Hunters, that is the first commandment.

60
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,320
Those who call themselves Hunters
should always be on the hunt.

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,570
A hunt involves both hunter and prey.

62
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,080
It is a battle of resolve.

63
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,780
Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve
is what makes a successful hunt.

64
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,040
The loser has to follow the
winner's rules and customs.

65
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,340
Usually, this means the loser's death.

66
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,340
Rules...

67
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,410
If you don't want that result, then win.

68
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,740
Improving your Nen is important, of course.

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,030
But to be a successful Hunter, you must
understand your enemy and yourself.

70
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,780
Th-That's why...

71
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,150
That's why you hit me back then!

72
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,320
Fool!

73
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,030
Why would you try to enter Snake
Beech Forest in this season?!

74
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,340
Look!

75
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,930
That's a territorial marker
made by Foxbears with cubs.

76
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,090
Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!

77
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,970
That was the forest's rule and custom.

78
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,810
You taught me the rules in Ging's place.

79
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
Oh...

80
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,470
That's right... I just remembered.

81
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,830
A Hunter License?

82
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,120
What's this?

83
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,870
This is Ging-san's.

84
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,120
Huh? It's Ging's?

85
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,250
Do you remember what my final test was?

86
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,380
Yeah, to find Ging.

87
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,490
Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me.

88
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,060
He said I should use it to find him...

89
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,110
I planned to return it to him once I did.

90
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,900
Huh? He wouldn't take it back?

91
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,190
No...

92
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,040
I completely forgot I had it.

93
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,280
Gon, you said that you're going to
find Ging-san on your own, right?

94
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,190
Huh?

95
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,040
Yeah.

96
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,630
Then you have to do it.

97
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,510
And would you return this for me?

98
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,440
Sure!

99
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,550
But first, I have to finish this job
with you and get a lot stronger.

100
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,060
After that, I'll find Ging and give this back.

101
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,140
I promise!

102
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm counting on you.

103
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,560
Well,

104
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,400
let's get a move on before we lose the trail.

105
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,460
Take that!

106
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,830
Next!

107
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,490
Being average is terrible...

108
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,370
You have to go to all this trouble
just to unleash your power.

109
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,830
Peggy, I'll leave this to you.

110
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,970
Where are you going?

111
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,500
I want to find out how strong I really am.

112
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,700
That's a monster.

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,100
What is this?

114
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
I don't believe it!

115
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,260
What's wrong, Kite?

116
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,430
Gon, Killua...

117
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,330
Run!

118
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,990
Huh?

119
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,700
Hurry up!

120
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,030
Get out of here!

121
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Found you...

122
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,220
Get away from me!

123
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
Malice

124
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,470
Idio—

125
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,890
Good decision, Killua.

126
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Take Gon and run!

127
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,920
This time, you're in big trouble...

128
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,030
Let's see if you get a good roll!

129
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,910
3!

130
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,920
Ah, so you can do stuff like that?

131
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,530
We were overconfident...

132
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,010
The two of us were still weaker
than Kite who'd lost an arm.

133
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,890
That thing knew.

134
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,100
This is reality.

135
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,970
If Kite had been alone,

136
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,680
this probably wouldn't have happened.

137
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,730
We were fools!

138
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,290
Hey...

139
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,220
Look.

140
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,340
Huh? You left Kite behind?

141
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,760
Why?!

142
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,540
What happened?

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,270
Explain what's going on!

144
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,020
H-Hey, what are you doing?!

145
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,480
Yes, I understand.

146
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Can you wait there a little longer?

147
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,030
We're headed your way right now.

148
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,230
We have reinforcements.

149
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,260
Chairman Netero.

150
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,500
What's this? They're just kids.

151
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,350
If you're here to play, you'll get burned.

152
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,590
Go back home.

153
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,590
Stop it, Morel-san.

154
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,470
That isn't nice...

155
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,720
They're only children.

156
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,510
You look pretty defeated.

157
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,240
Was the enemy that strong?

158
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,410
One of them could use Nen.

159
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,470
That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.

160
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,350
Worse than my brother's...

161
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,000
Worse than Hisoka's...

162
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,860
Now that I've learned Nen myself, I can tell.

163
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,740
You guys are unbelievably strong.

164
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,010
But I still can't see you defeating that thing...

165
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,010
Whenever humans encounter the unknown,

166
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,490
they tend to lose perspective.

167
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,920
Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic.

168
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,430
We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed.

169
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,430
You're no better than I am, Knov.

170
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,090
Kid...

171
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:10,460
The minute you start talking about who
can win in a Nen fight, you're wrong.

172
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,690
In most cases, you won't know
your opponent's abilities.

173
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,070
One instant of carelessness

174
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,090
is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.

175
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,000
You can't make assumptions based
on the amount of aura displayed.

176
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,970
The battle can turn at any point.

177
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,470
That's what fighting with Nen means.

178
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,680
But regardless,

179
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,150
you must always fight certain of victory.

180
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,170
That is a Nen user's spirit.

181
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,570
The moment you were overwhelmed

182
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,790
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.

183
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,890
You're lower than a loser!

184
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,990
Morel, that's enough.

185
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,000
Is Gon asleep?

186
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,810
He was going to attack the enemy,

187
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,500
so I used force to stop him.

188
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,850
I didn't have time to control my strength,

189
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,010
so I don't know when he'll wake up.

190
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,500
That kid shows some promise, then.

191
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,760
Morel!

192
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,450
It's difficult to believe that giant
Chimera Ants are eating humans,

193
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,310
but since it appears to be true,

194
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,900
we must keep casualties to a minimum.

195
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,270
If we send fighters who aren't strong enough,
they'll only strengthen the enemy.

196
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,410
Do you understand?

197
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,150
Yeah.

198
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,900
That's why there are only three.

199
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,280
A select few...

200
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,510
We're not

201
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,200
strong enough.

202
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,030
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.

203
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,440
It's your decision whether you want to fight.

204
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,350
But you must defeat them before you come.

205
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,790
If you wish to live as a Hunter...

206
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,710
We are not desperate for help.

207
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,560
We only seek the strong.

208
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,480
Will you fight!? Or not!?

209
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,170
The moment you were overwhelmed

210
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,510
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.

211
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,100
You're lower than a loser!

212
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,580
I am no longer qualified...

213
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,590
Killua...

214
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,470
Thanks.

215
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,520
Why would you thank me?

216
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,060
Weren't you the one who stopped me?

217
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,040
Had I lost control back there,
I would've gotten in Kite's way.

218
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,050
Then, all three of us could have died.

219
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,550
But I...

220
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,550
I let Kite die...

221
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,180
Kite is alive!

222
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,560
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!

223
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,470
But considering his injury,
he'd have a hard time moving around.

224
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,580
So he's probably hiding.

225
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,570
Waiting for us to return!

226
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,820
So we should hurry back...

227
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,020
Once we're stronger.

228
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,000
To save Kite!

229
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,350
Gon...

230
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,290
You are light.

231
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,780
Yeah, you're right.

232
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,160
Sometimes, you shine so
brightly, I must look away.

233
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,860
But even so, is it still okay
if I stay at your side?

234
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,310
Let's go.

235
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,110
To become stronger!

236
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,220
We welcome you anytime!!

237
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,980
Prepare a freezer in the castle.

238
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,800
We need one that can store
over a hundred humans.

239
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,830
To ensure that our collection doesn't rot.

240
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,890
Yep.

241
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,730
I think

242
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,730
I'm pretty strong.

243
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,260
Next time: Promise x and x Reunion.

244
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,590
It has to be Killua...

245
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,220
Stay asleep in the chair, man.
