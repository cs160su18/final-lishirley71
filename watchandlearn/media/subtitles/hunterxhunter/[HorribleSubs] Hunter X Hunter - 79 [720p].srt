2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,410
Would you allow us to have names?

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,980
What is a name?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,990
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,490
Names... Quite amusing.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,000
The King's three Royal Guards.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,370
I shall name you myself.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,050
No x Good x NGL

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,540
Mitene Union

10
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,540
Yorknew City

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,450
Seeking the giant Chimera Ant,

12
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,030
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau

13
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,560
Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.

14
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,960
NGL Autonomous Region        Republic of Rokario

15
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,790
Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,560
to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region.

17
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,040
NGL, huh?

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
They believe living naturally is always better.

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,620
They may be weird for living there,

20
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,580
but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,410
No idea what's going on,

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,580
but I've already driven in about
ten similar groups today alone.

23
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,050
Ten groups?!

24
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,490
Yeah.

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,380
Then it sounds like we're
among the last to arrive.

26
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,600
They're probably other pro Hunter teams.

27
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,230
All looking for the giant insects?

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,870
Yeah, those veterans are good.

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,610
Somehow, they've managed
to obtain this information.

30
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,610
But are there really bugs

31
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,880
large enough to attack humans?

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,110
It defies common sense,

33
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,750
but that voice they heard over the transmitter...

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,970
M-Monsters...

35
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,720
Giant bugs!

36
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,010
It could be some other kind of organism.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,140
NGL is one big nature reserve,

38
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,240
so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms
that haven't been reported in academic circles.

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,320
It wouldn't be strange if there are
insects that attack humans.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,350
Even if there aren't any giant bugs,

41
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,030
this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the
existence of any unidentified organisms.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,410
As a new Magical Beast Hunter,
I need to produce results.

43
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,580
Now that I'm here, I have
to accomplish something.

44
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,430
According to the scouts that
went out first thing this morning,

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,100
a new human village has been discovered

46
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,320
in sector MA18, in the southwest.

47
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,340
There are twelve houses,

48
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,320
with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents.

49
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,580
Hey, that's pretty big.

50
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,530
Guess there are still a few large villages left.

51
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,060
I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,190
Then I will add this village to our
list of targets for the day.

53
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,780
Colt, could you make the trip?

54
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,760
Roger.

55
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,510
What's this, Peggy?

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,300
You aren't sending me?

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,000
Cheetu, I need you to go northwest,
as originally planned.

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,980
Zazan, you accompany him.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,360
There aren't any large villages
left in the northwest.

60
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,730
Even if there were, there probably
aren't any strong, young humans.

61
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,110
It's more fun when I get to chase them around.

62
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Cheetu!

63
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,210
We do not hunt for amusement.

64
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,060
We serve the Queen.

65
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,250
We need only capture the
requested number of humans.

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,350
I know that, Colt.

67
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,220
We'll get the job done.

68
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,630
Right, Zazan?

69
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll fulfill the quota.

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,650
But I don't need you telling
me how to hunt my prey.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,760
I'll do things my own way.

72
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,000
It's fun to hunt humans when
they're running around.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,140
What did you say?

74
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,110
Well, there you go.

75
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,020
Let's go, Zazan.

76
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,840
Colt, don't get too worked up.

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
You'll have an easier time

78
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,280
if you learn to relax.

79
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,760
They dare do things their own way?

80
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,790
At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!

81
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,690
While the use of names

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,690
is convenient for leading the troops,

83
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,180
we don't want to encourage too much individuality.

84
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,760
Their behavior could lead to
a breakdown in command.

85
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,560
We must take steps.

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,700
I agree that something must be done.

87
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,280
Meleoron and Yunju have yet to
show themselves at a war council.

88
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,790
Meleoron!

89
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,550
Stop hiding, and show yourself!

90
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,650
Just to be clear,

91
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,220
it isn't my fault Yunju is absent.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,830
You were hiding because you
thought you'd be blamed?

93
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,720
You're supposed to be a squadron leader.

94
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,090
Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,180
See? I'm the one getting yelled at.

96
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,230
That's why I didn't want to come out.

97
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,340
It's always my fault.

98
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,090
You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.

99
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,840
And further...

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,100
I'll talk!

101
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,730
It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.

102
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,860
He's the one who ran off on
his own to hunt humans.

103
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,290
What? Toward which sector?

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,470
Was a new village discovered?

105
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,470
That's not it!

106
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,960
You remember the humans who fought back?

107
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,170
The ones who were armed with guns.

108
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,500
Yunju was

109
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,940
all worked up about making them his pets.

110
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,910
Come on! What are you doing?

111
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,570
I accidentally stepped on you.

112
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,840
You're supposed to entertain us more!

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,320
That's right!

114
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,010
Run for your lives!

115
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,330
Until you're dead.

116
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,710
This is the border with NGL.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,610
Those two huge trees serve as
the checkpoint and embassy.

118
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,900
What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?

119
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,150
These people are all so weird.

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,360
Stay alert.

121
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,640
The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is
more than a nature-loving organization.

122
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,540
Got it.

123
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,370
What brings you here?

124
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,400
We're on a hunt.

125
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,880
A quarantined organism may
have invaded this country.

126
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,220
If you are pro Hunters,

127
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,310
then we cannot deny you entry.

128
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,870
Follow me.

129
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,060
You're using computers and machines.

130
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,250
This place isn't within NGL's borders.

131
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,840
This area is used for foreign relations
and information exchange.

132
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,650
Are there any facilities similar
to this within the country?

133
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,840
No, not a single one.

134
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,400
No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.

135
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,850
Naturally, visitors are also not allowed

136
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,410
to bring any inside.

137
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,650
Which means that you'll need
to remove all metallic,

138
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,860
petroleum, glass, or other
such goods on your person.

139
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,600
D-Does that include my glasses?

140
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,620
Yes.

141
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,600
If your clothes, belts, shoes, or
underwear contain any plastic,

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,730
chemicals, or metal, you must remove them.

143
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,210
That isn't funny.

144
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,790
You're telling us to strip naked?

145
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,750
Don't worry.

146
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,220
There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.

147
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,280
Also, if there are any bolts inside
your body, dental implants,

148
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,220
gold, silver, or silicon enhancements

149
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,610
that cannot be removed,
you will not be allowed to enter.

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,610
Shop

151
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,190
Only the five of us are left?

152
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,670
I want you to stand by in the closest town.

153
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,270
We'll return here within two
weeks and contact you.

154
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Got it.

155
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,290
The checkpoint is over there.

156
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,140
There will be a physical exam and interview,

157
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,560
as well as metal, x-ray,

158
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,290
and ultrasound scanning.

159
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,100
The security is rather strict.

160
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,250
Some people have smuggled in guns by
hiding the parts inside their bodies.

161
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,770
It's common for people to hide cameras
or cell phones in their rectums.

162
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,890
Some people even trained animals

163
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,260
to bring them laptops once they were inside.

164
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,710
All of you are clean.

165
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,260
Thank you for your patience.

166
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,530
Please pass through.

167
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,470
Welcome to NGL.

168
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,170
Okay, let's begin the hunt.

169
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,340
Horse Rental
12000 per day

170
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,600
Any sightings of giant insects?

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,990
I haven't heard anything.

172
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,630
Even if there were any such creatures,

173
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,060
the citizens in this country wouldn't
make much of a fuss.

174
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,590
If we are attacked and killed by animals,

175
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,340
that is simply nature taking its course.

176
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,050
Anyway, we should follow the
coast and check the villages.

177
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,610
If we go through all of them
and nothing turns up,

178
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,340
it probably isn't in this country.

179
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,000
That's assuming those guys
were telling the truth.

180
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,850
They're still following us,

181
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,110
aren't they?

182
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,850
Yeah...

183
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,460
They claim to be here

184
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,860
in case we encounter unknown tribes and
require interpreters or intermediaries.

185
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,500
But they're obviously here to watch us.

186
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,470
Well, I never expected the people
here to be of any help.

187
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,030
My gut

188
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,690
tells me that it's here.

189
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,470
Don't move.

190
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,640
If you die, it won't be my fault.

191
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,150
A-A mere animal shouldn't order
a superior human around!

192
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,990
Mere animal? Superior human?

193
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,960
I don't understand...

194
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,160
How are you and I different?

195
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,280
Shut up!

196
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,680
Good grief...

197
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,850
Didn't your parents ever teach you

198
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,380
to answer a question when you're asked?

199
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,890
There's no hope for you, old-timer.

200
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,310
Try harder in your next life.

201
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,630
Now you've done it.

202
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,270
If you kill him, we aren't able to store him.

203
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,130
I can make meatballs to serve
to the Queen within the day.

204
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,010
People like him irritate me.

205
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,010
They don't know their place.

206
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,210
I prefer to see them running around in fear.

207
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,520
Yesterday, you shot one in
the back when they ran.

208
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,810
If you'd let me handle this, I could secure
our prey in a smarter fashion.

209
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,530
When you said, "Don't move,"
that was meant for me, right?

210
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,330
Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?

211
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,290
Don't get too cocky.

212
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide.

213
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,220
If you enjoy killing so much, you should
volunteer for the feeding squad.

214
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,570
No hope...

215
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,960
Damn that Yunju.

216
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,460
Shut up!

217
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,630
If you don't shut up, I'll eat you right here!

218
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,590
Rammot!

219
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,840
What are you doing?

220
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,090
What am I doing?
I'm transporting the food.

221
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,020
Isn't that obvious?

222
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,000
Be more selective with your prey!

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
How often do I have to repeat myself?

224
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,690
That human won't serve any purpose.

225
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,440
And we've already met our quota for the day.

226
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,850
You're wasting your time.

227
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,360
Then I'll eat it!

228
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,980
What?

229
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,490
It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway.

230
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,280
This is an order, Rammot.

231
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,710
Damn.

232
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,340
Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.

233
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,770
Huh?

234
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,050
I don't see any problem.

235
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,030
I enjoy what I do.

236
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,940
You want to take this one?

237
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,280
I guess it's dead, so you can't.

238
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,190
Which squadron are you from?

239
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,290
Oh, Zazan...

240
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,290
That nasty woman.

241
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,420
You have my sympathy.

242
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,430
You could join Yunju's team.

243
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,960
I hear that they're allowed to
kill any humans they want.

244
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,310
If you take this as a gift,

245
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,190
they'll probably let you join on the spot.

246
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,250
What is this?

247
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,530
It's terrible...

248
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,840
Who did this?

249
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,410
A gun?

250
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,320
People are fighting with guns!

251
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,450
Who could it be?

252
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,960
Guns aren't allowed in NGL!

253
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,590
They're members of the NGL
underground that manufactures D².

254
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,440
Huh?

255
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,780
I don't think these wounds
were inflicted by humans.

256
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,520
Does that mean...

257
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,500
I can't be certain yet...

258
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,330
But if the monster we seek
was responsible for this,

259
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,590
we won't be able to handle it
with our current members.

260
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,740
Th-There they are!

261
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,280
Monsters!

262
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!

263
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,590
Run on my signal.

264
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,580
Got it?

265
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,260
Rainbow!

266
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,260
Seven Spectrum Array

267
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,810
Red Arrow

268
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,300
Red Arrow!

269
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,060
Now!

270
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,190
No hope.

271
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,520
Over here!

272
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,420
Are you okay?

273
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,660
Yes...

274
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,260
Anyway, we should contact
the other pro Hunters.

275
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,120
Can you handle that, Ponzu?

276
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,450
Got it.

277
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,470
What? That's it?

278
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,250
No, there are more.

279
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,450
There sure are!

280
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,040
I can smell living humans!

281
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,180
What do we do, Zaikahal?

282
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,740
As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage,

283
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,190
they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler.

284
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,200
A storm brews in NGL.

285
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,680
And Gon's group is heading straight for it.

286
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,320
Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.

287
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,180
Gon, what's wrong?

288
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,210
Do you have a fever?

289
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,730
What? A crick in your back?

290
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,490
Terrible...
