2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,740
Ah, this is the foundation I wanted!

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,620
I also want this lipstick and manicure spray.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,740
Oh, what a cute wig...

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,050
Boss, we should get going soon.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,550
Just a little longer.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,750
I should buy this camisole too.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,590
Her shopping's gonna be the death of me.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,930
I concur.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,050
A x Brutal x Battlefield

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,850
Was there anything else we needed?

12
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,060
Did you want anything, Eliza?

13
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,440
No, nothing at all.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,570
I have to go to the restroom.

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,790
It's okay...

16
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,570
Watch my stuff for me.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,850
Will Kurapika be okay?

18
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,830
I used my flute to help him recover a little.

19
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,960
How do you feel about the
whole assassins business?

20
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,960
The Ten Dons are hiring professionals
to handle the Troupe.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,220
Professionals?

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,720
So, Kurapika...

23
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,810
I want you to join those hit men.

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,710
Judging by his heartbeat,

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,720
he wasn't entirely pleased
about joining the hit men.

26
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,510
Of course not.

27
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,800
However, Kurapika is extremely determined.

28
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:05,120
To achieve his goal, he's certainly
willing to sacrifice everything.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
That's a hard road...

30
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,590
I couldn't do it.

31
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,620
What's the point of a life in which
you're basically killing yourself?

32
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,410
She's taking a long time.

33
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,780
Once we finish this job,

34
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,990
I'm using the money to see
the world on my bike.

35
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,890
That sounds really nice.

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,160
Not enjoying yourself is a crime.

37
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,020
There are many ways to spend a life.

38
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,650
Everyone has different ideas
about what's important.

39
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,060
Huh?

40
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,900
What's wrong?

41
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,900
She's gone!

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,550
Huh?

43
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,650
What?!

44
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,910
Daddy's such a liar!

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,240
He wasn't going to take me to the auction!

46
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,610
Fine, I'll just go by myself!

47
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,760
Come in.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,040
Forever Active

49
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,270
One, two, three, four, five, six...

50
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,530
Looks like everyone's here.

51
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,650
No, not yet.

52
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,280
I thought the team only had eight members.

53
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,810
Nostrade is sending an additional person.

54
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,790
Tsk, the guy who uses that
voodoo fortunetelling?

55
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,300
Then, has everyone arrived?

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,060
The job is to annihilate the Phantom Troupe.

57
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,560
When the auction kicks off again,

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,060
they may show up.

59
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,560
If they do, dispose of them.

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,710
You're free to use any means you want.

61
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,570
This team will be after the same target.

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
We should decide how we address
each other when communicating.

63
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
Just use colors.

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Call me Blue.

65
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,080
I'll be Red.

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,580
It's like playing a game.

67
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,730
Eh? What about you guys?

68
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,820
Silva.

69
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,850
I'm Zeno.

70
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,180
Zeno? What color is that?

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,230
We will both use our real names.

72
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,340
What?

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,240
You're welcome to call me by name,

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,710
but I won't take orders.

75
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,350
We'll do this our own way.

76
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,860
Silva and Zeno...

77
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,850
Of the Zoldyck family?

78
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,360
Let me know if you want someone killed.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,610
I'm willing to give you a thirty percent
discount for being in the same line of work.

80
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,530
They're from Killua's family.

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,620
Does it really matter

82
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,700
what we call one another?

83
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,110
Agreed.

84
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,250
There's no requirement we work together.

85
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,710
But we're talking about the Troupe.

86
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,740
Attacking alone will be dangerous.

87
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,920
And you?

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Shaky teamwork will only cause confusion.

89
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,700
I will move alone.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,540
So it's 5 to 4.

91
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,770
We have our answer.

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,310
The auction begins at nine.
We will transport you to the auction hall.

93
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,030
Please wait here until it's time.

94
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,430
Yo, Nostrade...

95
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,040
How are you feeling?

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,310
Not too bad.

97
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,450
Not too bad?

98
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,160
You've gotten pretty full of yourself.

99
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,320
Not too long ago, you were just
leading a little country gang,

100
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,670
and now you're acting like my equal.

101
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,850
I hear you've been rubbing your hands
together so much, your skin rubbed off.

102
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,150
You okay?

103
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,680
It's sad when a man shows jealousy.

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,310
Bastard!

105
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,550
What's this about?

106
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,820
Go ahead and stick that knife in me!

107
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,570
Kurapika, that's enough!

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,090
Let's be clear...
No one's impressed by you!

109
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,780
Many people envy my success,

110
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,390
while they ignore their own failings.

111
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,090
However, I intend to continue to rise.

112
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,180
By using Neon's fortunetelling.

113
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,250
I expect great things from you.

114
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,210
You will be appropriately rewarded
when the time comes.

115
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,750
Yes.

116
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,860
The police are cooperating?

117
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,560
Sixty percent of the votes

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,270
in the Yorknew City mayoral
election were bought.

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,870
And the police chief is the mayor's protégé.

120
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,800
Redirecting traffic is quite easy for us.

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,300
Hello?

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,830
Kurapika, it's terrible.

123
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,150
The boss ran away!

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,360
She changed clothes in the restroom,

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,380
so she must have planned ahead.

126
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,320
Then I can guess where she's going.

127
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,890
Return to the hotel and stand by.

128
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,990
What's wrong?

129
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,030
Your daughter's run away.

130
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,910
What?!

131
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,400
We probably have the same destination.

132
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,320
The auction?

133
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,660
Damn, she's turned off her phone.

134
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,710
But Neon doesn't have a pass...

135
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,410
She'll be turned away at the gate.

136
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,870
This is Light Nostrade!

137
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,660
I need you to convey an order
to all the guards at the gate!

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,180
If a girl about seventeen or
eighteen arrives with no pass,

139
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,410
they should take her into custody!

140
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,670
Her description...

141
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,180
Okay, please go ahead.

142
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,180
Whew,

143
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,840
I was stuck without a way
to get past that gate.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,430
Thank you so much.

145
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,850
You're very welcome.

146
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,440
Really?! When was that?

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,460
About five minutes ago...

148
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,690
Her hair and attire were slightly
different, but it was probably her.

149
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,860
She didn't have a pass?

150
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,830
She didn't appear to realize that
the auction required a pass.

151
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,580
She mentioned something about
her daddy, but then she left.

152
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,090
Yes, she got in a taxi alone.

153
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,590
Yes, goodbye.

154
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,090
Nice work.

155
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,710
Neon, where have you gone?

156
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,420
I'll search for her.

157
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,350
Do you have a map of the city?

158
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,810
I've heard that you're a good fortuneteller.

159
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,770
Huh?

160
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,630
Someone once mentioned it to me.

161
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,370
I can't remember who...

162
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,780
I'm good.

163
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Important people request
my services all the time.

164
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,110
What's your accuracy?

165
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,250
They say I'm always right.

166
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,080
They say?

167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,630
Aren't you the one telling the fortunes?

168
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,510
My hand moves on its own.

169
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,380
Oh, how impressive.

170
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,180
Would you tell me mine?

171
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,050
Sure.

172
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,390
Write your full name, date of birth,
and blood type on a sheet of paper.

173
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,310
Will this work?

174
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,400
Let me see.

175
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,360
Chrollo Lucilfer...

176
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,800
That's a strange name.

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,320
My friends call me "boss."

178
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,150
What?

179
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,600
That's even stranger!

180
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,910
Then, I'll tell your fortune.

181
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,930
Your daughter is already in the
Cemetery Building on the auction site.

182
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,490
What? But how?!

183
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,930
Regardless, we should hurry.

184
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,940
Okay, all done.

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
May I have a look?

186
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,810
Sure.

187
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,760
My fortunes are a little strange.

188
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,540
They usually have four or five verses.

189
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,700
Each one corresponds to
a week of the month,

190
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,380
so the first may have already happened.

191
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,800
Oh...

192
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,860
The calendar loses a precious component.

193
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,780
The remaining months gather to mourn.

194
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,670
The mourners play a melody,

195
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,730
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

196
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,550
Amazing.

197
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,990
It's correct.

198
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,090
About this first verse...

199
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,060
Huh?

200
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,250
Oh, stop...

201
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,060
I never look at the fortunes I write.

202
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,660
Why not?

203
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,240
I have a feeling they're more accurate
if I stay away from them.

204
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,110
Then may I ask you a question?

205
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,570
Uh-huh.

206
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,320
This verse refers to a requiem for the dead.

207
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,820
Do you believe in the afterlife?

208
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,640
Hmm...

209
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,830
Not really.

210
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,960
My fortunes are for people who are alive.

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,050
Like you, Chrollo-san.

212
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,740
I'm guessing that the requiem

213
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,550
is meant to help you, not the dead.

214
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,100
You're probably right.

215
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,460
Let's go.

216
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,590
They'll let us start browsing
at the auction soon.

217
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,860
Actually, I heard that from someone else.

218
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,240
Eh?

219
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,610
When I was little, I saw a
fortuneteller on TV say that.

220
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,190
That fortunes were meant to
make the living happy.

221
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,870
Really?

222
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,860
So the fortuneteller tried to
avoid giving negative fortunes.

223
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,130
Negative fortunes?

224
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,670
The idea was

225
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,900
to encourage people to wish for and
work toward better things.

226
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,140
At the time, I was really moved...

227
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,730
From then on, I wanted to be a fortuneteller.

228
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,590
The calendar loses a precious component.

229
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,650
The remaining months gather to mourn.

230
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,910
The mourners play a melody,

231
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,800
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

232
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,800
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

233
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,230
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

234
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,330
But you will remain supreme.

235
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,460
Even after losing half your limbs.

236
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,270
Enjoy the interlude.

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,290
Search out new allies.

238
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,830
East is the direction to go.

239
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,620
You will find one who awaits you.

240
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,190
A few years later, that fortuneteller
was arrested for being a con artist.

241
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,690
Are you talking about the Galactic Grandma?

242
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,930
Yep!

243
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,560
I remember that she didn't
believe in the afterlife.

244
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,450
Right, so that's why I don't, either.

245
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,640
Personally, I believe in ghosts.

246
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,460
Huh?

247
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:08,570
And that's why I'll do as he
would have wanted.

248
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,720
What do you mean?

249
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,430
Go wild.

250
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,850
Are you okay?

251
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,150
Call a doctor!

252
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,860
We're on the first floor,
by the north elevator.

253
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,610
Someone's ill. Call an ambulance.

254
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,640
We can't.

255
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,490
They won't let an ambulance
inside without a pass.

256
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,880
What did you say?

257
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,160
What if the unthinkable happens?!

258
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,850
This is the daughter of the
Nostrade Family boss!

259
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,170
Will you take responsibility for her life?!

260
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,200
Tsk, got it.

261
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,550
She has fans among the Ten Dons.

262
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,530
Fine, we'll make it happen.

263
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,340
Hey, call for an ambulance!

264
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,290
Got it.

265
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,580
Are you able to rewind this monitor?

266
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,420
Huh? Yeah.

267
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,610
That chop was incredibly fast...

268
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,700
Only I could have caught it.

269
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,450
It's been a while since I was this excited.

270
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,450
There is my prey.

271
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,720
Nostrade-sama, your daughter is

272
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,710
resting in room 501, on the fifth floor.

273
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,220
She shouldn't have been able to secure a pass...

274
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,090
How did she get in?

275
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,330
Your daughter's picture is on the Hunter website.

276
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,290
What?

277
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,650
Most likely, someone found
this picture on the site,

278
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,900
approached her, and then brought her here.

279
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,020
I'll find that person and kill him!

280
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,240
Please remain calm.

281
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,490
I don't believe capturing your
daughter was their objective.

282
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,210
She may have been a hostage in case they
had trouble infiltrating the building.

283
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,160
It's dangerous here.

284
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,220
I called Melody and Basho.

285
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,800
They should arrive soon.

286
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,010
Can I trust them?

287
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,300
You should go with them.

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,280
But the auction...

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,360
There won't be one.

290
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,010
This place will become a battlefield.

291
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,880
The auction will be postponed again.

292
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,230
A trail of blood.

293
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,890
He wants to be found...

294
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,030
By leaving a scent that only another killer

295
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,990
would catch.

296
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,470
You are just like me.

297
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,790
We are the same.

298
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,800
Addicted to murder.

299
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,200
Relax.

300
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,040
I won't use any cheap tricks.

301
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,810
Let's play one-on-one.

302
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,260
Yeah.

303
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,310
I have a message from the boss.

304
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,570
He wants to go wild in the Cemetery
Building, so we should come.

305
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,260
We aren't too far away.

306
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,680
What about everyone else?

307
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,860
The rest had the same idea.

308
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,700
They've been cleaning up the trash,
while approaching the building.

309
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Okay, then let's go.

310
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,050
Also, the boss actually added a rule this time.

311
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,710
A rule? What?

312
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,930
Go absolutely crazy.

313
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,030
The calendar loses a precious component.

314
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,280
The remaining months gather to mourn.

315
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,850
The mourners play a melody,

316
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,800
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

317
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,630
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,

318
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,120
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.

319
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,100
But you will remain supreme.

320
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,610
Even after losing half your limbs.

321
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,610
Enjoy the interlude.

322
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,710
Search out new allies.

323
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,840
East is the direction to go.

324
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,870
You will find one who awaits you.

325
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,880
Why?

326
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,890
Why?

327
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,200
Why am I still alive?

328
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,260
This is known as an Indoor Fish.

329
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,120
Made from Nen, it can only
exist in enclosed spaces.

330
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,040
It's a carnivore that enjoys human flesh.

331
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,540
Its victims don't bleed or feel pain.

332
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,910
And they won't die until the
Indoor Fish disappears.

333
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,060
Won't die...

334
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,300
The calendar loses a precious component.

335
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,580
The remaining months gather to mourn.

336
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,780
The mourners play a melody,

337
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,960
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.

338
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,300
Uvo-san,

339
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,180
can you hear us?

340
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,030
We are playing a requiem for you.

341
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,450
It was the start of a stormy night,

342
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,730
fierce and drenched with blood,
yet somehow overwhelmingly sad.

343
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

344
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

345
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

346
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

347
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

348
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

349
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

350
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

351
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:19,920
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

352
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,420
Today, we introduce Phinks.

353
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,830
A Phantom Troupe member.

354
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,370
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

355
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,810
He's an Enhancer.

356
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,540
An Enhancer.

357
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,310
He's strong enough to punch through a body.

358
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,920
The greater the windup,
the stronger his punch.

359
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,250
Sometimes, he dresses like an Egyptian mummy.

360
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,880
It's his name.

361
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,420
Next time: Assault x And x Impact.

362
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh, Gon...

363
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,090
Wherefore art thou Gon?!

364
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,010
Killua, that's because

365
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm Gon!

366
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,490
That's it?
