2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,480
Yeah, this looks real.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,850
There's a video attached.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,110
We have two targets.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,110
A man and a woman.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,660
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,610
Got it.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,680
Let's go, Killua.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,240
Yeah.

10
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,040
Pursuit x And x Analysis

11
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,230
After a tip about the Phantom Troupe,
Gon and his friends move out.

12
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,290
There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga.

13
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,250
However, the two aren't just
waiting around to be caught.

14
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,920
Was Uvo really killed?

15
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,810
Probably.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,920
Uvo was more than just a dumb brute.

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,070
I know that.

18
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,260
Even if he were fighting
a difficult opponent,

19
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,200
he had the wits and experience to prevail.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,530
Hello?

21
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm the one who submitted the request.

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,150
You're late! Where are you?

23
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,720
Stop looking around...

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,850
I can see you.

25
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,990
It's the couple behind your boyfriend?

26
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,820
I'll wire the money to you now,

27
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,090
so please confirm receipt.

28
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,840
For real?

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's go!

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
Hurry!

31
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,850
But Uvo didn't return.

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,480
Has he ever been late without informing us?

33
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,610
But remember what he said?

34
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,110
He wasn't coming back until he
settled up with that chain user.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,890
That's why I said probably.

36
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,620
I never said he was definitely dead.

37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,030
Just a hunch?

38
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,850
Just a hunch.

39
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,710
Well, you're usually right.

40
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,500
Okay, we should decide our next move.

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,030
How do we catch those two?

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,540
It's impossible.

43
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,640
We aren't strong enough to handle them.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,930
What was that?

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,670
We won't know until we try!

46
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,330
And why are you saying this now?!

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,100
Quiet... They'll notice us.

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,610
But it's still true.

49
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,400
I knew it as soon as I saw them.

50
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,490
My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member.

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,550
Huh?

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,310
What?

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,780
One of the few times I've
ever heard him complain.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,930
Said the job wasn't worth the price.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,540
That's considered the greatest
compliment a target can get.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,920
That was when he told us

57
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,810
to stay away from the Troupe.

58
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,880
It's been a few years,

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,250
so I thought we might stand a chance...

60
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,570
They're really that strong?

61
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,690
Would it help you to picture
two Hisokas sitting there?

62
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,740
That is definitely not

63
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,190
something we can handle.

64
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,320
So, why do you think they're here?

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,970
Aren't they on a date?

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,420
Huh? Really?

67
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,200
No, they noticed that other
couple behind them.

68
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,710
They're paying close attention
to their surroundings.

69
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,340
At first, I thought it was just caution
because the Mafia is after them.

70
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,090
But in that case, they wouldn't
be sitting in a public place.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,850
They aren't worried at all.

72
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,730
They're waiting for someone to find them.

73
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,730
Acting as bait, to draw out their prey.

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,730
We're being watched.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,630
They aren't amateurs.

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,210
Yeah, I can't tell where they are,

77
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,090
but they're focused on us.

78
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,370
Is it the chain user?

79
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,280
No idea.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,410
If it is, we'll follow the
boss' orders to go wild.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,330
I believe the boss wishes to recruit him.

82
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,000
Machi...

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,260
The boss only told us to find
him and bring him back.

84
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,890
Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?

85
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,700
Alive or dead.
By any means necessary.

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,270
Right?

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,840
You're free to interpret the
boss' orders as you like,

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,370
but you can't force me to agree.

89
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,240
I haven't said anything yet.

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,910
You're the one forcing the issue.

91
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,050
The atmosphere changed.

92
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,990
I've got a really bad feeling...

93
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,700
Did they notice us?

94
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,720
It's okay.

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,130
They haven't noticed us yet.

96
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,630
Are you sure?

97
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,050
Besides, I can't use Zetsu like
you guys to mask my presence.

98
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,800
If we used Zetsu, that would
attract their attention.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,190
They aren't trying to sense Nen.

100
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,220
They're trying to see if there's anyone

101
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,710
in this area who looks or acts suspicious.

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,350
So you'd better wipe those
looks off your faces.

103
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,190
Act normal.

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,450
Sorry, that was a bad idea.

105
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,570
Let's make it clear, then.

106
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,100
Are we going to take him dead, or alive?

107
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,730
Fine.

108
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Heads.

109
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Tails.

110
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,640
Her?

111
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,110
Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter.

112
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,230
Her name is Neon.

113
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,830
According to the online Hunter information,

114
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,230
the chain user is one of her bodyguards.

115
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,200
As for her other bodyguards,

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,840
we have pictures and names for these five.

117
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,550
And this girl is responsible
for Nostrade's success?

118
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
Most likely.

119
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,530
This information comes
from the Hunter website,

120
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,770
so it should be accurate.

121
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,000
I see...

122
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,750
Now I understand what happened.

123
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,010
It was wise to switch rooms.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,930
The Phantom Troupe is definitely
using the pro Hunter website.

125
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,960
If you'd moved any later,
Neon might have been in danger.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm grateful.

127
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,690
Looking ahead, the first step

128
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,760
is to get my daughter home.

129
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,170
Is that okay, Neon?

130
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,280
Well, I don't have a choice.

131
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,320
The auction was canceled,
so I don't have any reason to stay.

132
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,290
I really wanted to go...

133
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,830
They'll hold another auction next year.

134
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,320
Cheer up.

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,270
And I promise I'll recover

136
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,260
the items you wanted from those bandits.

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,860
Really?

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,860
Yes, I promise.

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,310
Have I ever broken a promise?

140
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,920
Have you ever kept a promise?

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,840
You make a good point...

142
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,690
I believe your names are
Melody and Basho?

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,050
Yes...

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,190
You'll take Neon back to
the house immediately.

145
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,090
To be on the safe side,
use simple disguises.

146
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,990
Okay, Neon.

147
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,120
Return to your room and pack.

148
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,550
Okay.

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,660
All right, let's get down to our real business.

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,880
The auction will resume tonight.

151
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,580
The time and location haven't changed.

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
The community must demonstrate

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,890
that they will not allow anyone
to intimidate them.

154
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,520
The Ten Dons have vowed to
recover the stolen merchandise.

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,020
The stolen merchandise?

156
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,350
As I told you earlier,

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,820
the man we captured claimed

158
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,940
that a Shadow Beast had taken
everything before they arrived.

159
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,340
Yes, that's correct.

160
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,040
The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,270
Nine bodies have been recovered so far.

162
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,480
The final member, Owl, was the one

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,170
carrying the merchandise.

164
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,090
He was probably captured by the Troupe.

165
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,290
The Ten Dons understand how
frightening Nen can be.

166
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,140
If the Troupe has someone who can
use Nen to compel confession,

167
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,680
they wouldn't even need torture.

168
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,630
It's believed that the merchandise Owl took

169
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,770
has fallen into the Troupe's hands.

170
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,460
So, as I was saying,

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,270
with the Shadow Beasts
destroyed, the Ten Dons

172
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,570
are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe.

173
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,820
Professionals?

174
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,130
To the Mafia,

175
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,250
murder is a tool, not our trade.

176
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,970
Considering our opponents,

177
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,260
it would be better to leave it to the experts.

178
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,220
We'll have them

179
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,630
crush the Troupe for us,
while avoiding further losses.

180
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,430
However, it's also a chance to make a
name for ourselves in the community.

181
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,370
We cannot allow those hit men all the glory.

182
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,980
So, Kurapika...

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,110
I want you to join those hit men.

184
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,740
Take care of the chain user for me.

185
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,220
Got it.

186
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,190
They're on the move.
What should we do?

187
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,380
As I told you, we can't
beat them in a fight.

188
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,890
We'll find a way...

189
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,140
We have to.

190
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,190
Yeah.

191
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,510
We can't leave empty-handed.

192
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,770
Okay.

193
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,550
Then listen carefully.

194
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,910
Gon and I will tail them.

195
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,030
We absolutely cannot let them spot us.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
We'll use Zetsu.

197
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,160
Wow...

198
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,280
I can see him standing here,
but I can't sense him.

199
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,410
Gon, I need you to make me two promises.

200
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,670
If they see us, we give up
immediately and escape.

201
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,050
If I judge that further pursuit is impossible
for any other reason, we give up.

202
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,970
Got it?

203
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,360
Uh-huh.

204
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,220
The signal to stop will be one phone call.

205
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,600
Make sure your phone's on vibrate.

206
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,460
If they split up, we follow the woman.

207
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,720
Leorio,

208
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,170
contact Zepile, and keep an
eye on the auction for us.

209
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,530
Got it.

210
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm guessing you've never
tailed anyone before?

211
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,150
Um...

212
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,480
Well...

213
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,770
During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka.

214
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,530
Really? Without his noticing?

215
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day.

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
Wow, not bad.

217
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,800
Ow... Why did you hit me?

218
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,360
Uh, it seemed appropriate.

219
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,950
Well, then you should have no problem.

220
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,920
Be sure to stay out of
their field of vision.

221
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
Okay, let's go.

222
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,310
Yeah!

223
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,070
The targets have passed the plaza
and entered a side street.

224
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,100
Okay, confirmed.

225
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,650
Do they know we're here?

226
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,450
It's okay.

227
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,360
We're using Zetsu, so they shouldn't notice
us unless something's really wrong.

228
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,420
But they're on constant guard
against pursuers, so stay vigilant.

229
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Yeah.

230
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,860
You, too.

231
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,100
Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?

232
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,150
I'm the one who has to be alert to
any change in their movements.

233
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,710
It's okay.

234
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,840
They haven't noticed us.

235
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,130
When they realize we're here,
they'll react in some way.

236
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,340
They can try to conceal it,

237
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,530
but their faces or behavior will betray it.

238
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,150
I've been put through life-or-death
shadowing exercises since I was three.

239
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,980
I won't fail and lose sight of them!

240
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,150
Are we being followed?

241
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,990
Most likely, I'd guess.

242
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm impressed.

243
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,490
I can't sense a thing.

244
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,250
They must be quite skilled.

245
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,060
Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area.

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,020
They must realize by now that
they're being followed.

247
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,530
Then is this a trap?

248
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,480
No, they don't know our exact locations.

249
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,210
Or maybe they don't know they're being
followed and are heading back to base.

250
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,000
That would make this a huge success.

251
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,650
Is this a trap?

252
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,040
Or their hideout?

253
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Which is it?

254
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,750
If it's a trap, we should run immediately.

255
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,440
If it's their hideout, we should continue.

256
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,050
They're acting calm...

257
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,050
We continue!

258
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,230
Our stalker isn't taking the bait.

259
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,560
It probably isn't the chain user.

260
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,640
Why not?

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,740
I can sense multiple people tailing us.

262
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,580
But the chain user works alone.

263
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,570
How can you be sure?

264
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,300
He's a member of the
Nostrade Family, right?

265
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,030
Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own.

266
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,330
I'm sure because the Mafia
hasn't taken any action.

267
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,770
If the Mafia were responsible,

268
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,290
they would use Uvo as a chip
against us, dead or alive.

269
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,850
Had they killed him, the news would
probably be on the Net by now.

270
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,110
Since there's nothing,

271
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,530
the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone,

272
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,080
without reporting it to the Mafia.

273
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,860
Why would someone who works
for the Mafia operate solo?

274
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,470
It was probably a personal grudge.

275
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,250
You're using "probably" a lot.

276
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,340
Shut up.

277
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,310
I doubt that someone seeking
revenge without Mafia backup

278
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,870
would team up with anyone else.

279
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,090
Thus, the chain user is operating alone

280
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,970
and unrelated to the group now pursuing us.

281
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,830
Your theory has a lot of holes.

282
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,260
Then what do you think?

283
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,340
Indeed...

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,740
I suspect that there's a link between
this tail and the chain user.

285
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,390
You just know?

286
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
I just know.

287
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,770
Man...

288
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,150
People who act on instinct
shouldn't criticize theories.

289
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, Killua?

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,780
They're waiting for someone
or trying to lure us out.

291
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,040
One or the other.

292
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,410
Do they know we're following them?

293
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,220
Right now, it's fifty-fifty.

294
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,050
But they don't know our location.

295
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,170
They want to draw us out because
they don't know where we are.

296
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,670
They're inviting us to show ourselves.

297
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,570
What do we do?

298
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,880
They may be waiting for someone else.

299
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,250
Hold your position and wait.

300
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,180
Gon, I'm hanging up.

301
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,100
Pay close attention.

302
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,180
If they give any kind of reaction,
we'll run for it!

303
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,170
Escape as soon as I ring the phone.

304
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,030
Got it?

305
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,940
Yeah, got it.

306
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,710
Phinks here.

307
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,450
Oh, what's up?

308
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,240
I wanted to see how you were doing.

309
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,910
We're being followed,
but they haven't made a move.

310
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,940
And we can't locate them,
so this will take a while.

311
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,620
Oh, then would you like some helpful info?

312
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,460
Hmm? What do you mean?

313
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,750
The stones were a distraction?

314
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,500
This'll get him!

315
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,780
He stopped me with ease...

316
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,260
With one hand!

317
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,210
Yo.

318
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,980
Phinks, why are you here?

319
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,490
Weren't you heading out with the boss?

320
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,490
This is the fourth floor.

321
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,240
To fool the enemy,
you first fool your allies.

322
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,840
The boss got me good again.

323
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,000
I wondered why there were so
many Zetsu masters around.

324
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,890
Stalking the stalkers?

325
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,270
Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?

326
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,250
They fooled us!

327
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,220
Okay, kid.

328
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,030
I have a few questions for you.

329
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,020
Boy, do you know the chain user?

330
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,790
Huh?

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,500
A Nen user who uses chains to fight.

332
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,190
We're looking for him.

333
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,690
He asked you to follow us, right?

334
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,440
I don't know who that is.

335
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,160
We were following you
for our own reasons.

336
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,270
I just need one moment...

337
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,410
With an opening, I can escape!

338
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,410
Well?

339
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,270
Well, indeed...

340
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,420
If he's lying, he's really good.

341
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,830
I can check.

342
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,750
Question 1...
Why were you following us?

343
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,550
Answer concisely.

344
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,650
Lying will only make the situation worse.

345
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,440
The Mafia has put a huge
bounty on your heads.

346
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,450
Websites are offering a lot of money
just for information on your location.

347
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,190
Question 2...
Who taught you to shadow people?

348
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,360
Well, mainly,

349
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,060
I was using Zetsu, a Nen ability,
to conceal my presence.

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm trying to become a pro Hunter.

351
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
Who taught you how to do that?

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,870
A Shingen-ryu master.

353
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,250
Question 3...

354
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,500
Do you know a Nen user
who fights with chains?

355
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,340
Chains?

356
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,050
He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator.

357
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,960
Does your master have chains
hanging from his right arm?

358
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,770
Or perhaps it's you?

359
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,290
I don't know.

360
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,550
My master is an Enhancer,

361
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,280
and he only taught me the
four major principles.

362
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,380
I see... Well, nothing we
can do, if you don't know.

363
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,740
Time for the last question, then.

364
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,550
You have two choices.

365
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,540
Consider carefully before you answer.

366
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,210
Do you want to die now or later?

367
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,290
Make your choice.

368
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,540
You have three seconds to answer.

369
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,800
It's useless.
Don't try anything foolish.

370
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,050
Yes...

371
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,820
Understood, we'll head over.

372
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,170
Boy, your friend surrendered.

373
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,190
I'll ask you once more.

374
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,820
Do you know the chain user?

375
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,810
My answer is the same.

376
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,750
I don't.

377
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,690
I see.

378
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,300
How about you?

379
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,830
Any guesses?

380
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,350
Welcome to our base.

381
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,860
They stand inside the
Phantom Troupe's hideout...

382
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,590
...nerves mounting to their limits.

383
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,490
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

384
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,150
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

385
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,950
Coming up, we have Gon

386
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,650
and Killua's

387
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Hunterpedia!

388
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,530
It's Gon

389
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,360
and Killua's

390
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,610
Hunterpedia!

391
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:20,000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

392
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,170
Today, we introduce Machi.

393
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,700
A Phantom Troupe member.

394
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,270
A Phantom Troupe member.

395
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,620
She's a Transmuter.

396
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:20,000
Transmutes aura into Nen
threads that she controls.

397
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,760
She can turn her aura into Nen threads.

398
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,460
Her special technique is Nen Stitches.

399
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,310
She can put your body back together!

400
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,210
Like this!

401
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Next time: Ally x And x Sword.

402
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,630
Snatch!

403
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,140
Bam!

404
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,970
Look! I caught it!

405
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,970
That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!

406
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,480
Ka-boom!
