2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,260
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,440
We entered the long and difficult path.

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,370
Then cut a hole in the wall,

11
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,060
to sneak into the short and easy path.

12
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,190
In an extreme situation,

13
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,090
you were able to calmly evaluate

14
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,810
our two options and circumvent them.

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,320
That's what makes you special.

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Hit x The x Target

17
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,830
The twenty-four applicants who have passed

18
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,830
the exam's Third Phase

19
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,330
exit Trick Tower, one by one,

20
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,640
for a long-awaited breath of fresh air.

21
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,360
Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations
on having escaped Trick Tower.

22
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,240
Only the Fourth Phase and
the Final Phase remain.

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,870
Two more...

24
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,570
The Fourth Phase will take place
over there, on Zevil Island.

25
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,250
Let us proceed.

26
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,910
I will need you to draw lots.

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,930
Lots?

28
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,310
For what?

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,060
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.

30
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,560
In here are twenty-four numbered cards.

31
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,200
In other words, your ID numbers
are on the cards.

32
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,420
Now, I need you each to draw a card,

33
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,700
in the order by which you
exited the tower.

34
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,200
Will the first person come forward?

35
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,230
Guess I'm next.

36
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm next.

37
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,910
Hey, Killua.

38
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,500
Huh?

39
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,250
He said something about hunting
and being hunted.

40
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,230
Does that mean we'll be
fighting each other?

41
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,510
Yeah, probably.

42
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,400
I don't know what this is all about,

43
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,800
but I draw with style...

44
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,430
Everyone's taken a card?

45
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,940
Then, remove the seal from your card.

46
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,160
The card indicates your target.

47
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,940
This box has recorded which card

48
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,350
each of you drew.

49
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,280
This means that you're free

50
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,480
to dispose of the cards if you wish.

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,020
The objective

52
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,980
is to steal your target's ID tag.

53
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh, so we don't need to kill each other.

54
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,280
Naturally, you're free to use
any method you choose

55
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,080
to steal the ID tags.

56
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,240
Including killing your target and
taking the tag off the corpse.

57
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,570
That sounds like the fastest way.

58
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,780
S-So that's what this is about?

59
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,000
Fool, there's nothing to be scared of.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Listen carefully!

61
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,010
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.

62
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,760
Your own ID is also worth three points.

63
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,520
All other ID tags are worth one point.

64
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,650
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.

65
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,580
So while on Zevil Island,

66
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,680
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.

67
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,480
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.

68
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,890
I'd like to commend everyone on board

69
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,050
for their excellent work during the
Hunter Exam's Third Phase!

70
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,340
I will serve as your guide.

71
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,300
My name is Khara!

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,810
It will take two hours for
this boat to reach Zevil Island.

73
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,880
All twenty-four applicants remaining here

74
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,190
are automatically qualified
to take next year's exam!

75
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,690
So if you fail this year, don't feel bad.

76
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,700
Please try again next year...

77
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,200
Th-This is so depressing.

78
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,080
The battle has already begun.

79
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Yeah, everyone's removed their ID tags,

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,840
and hid them.

81
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,830
Well, you're free to do as you like,

82
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,200
for the next two hours.

83
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,180
Please enjoy the boat ride.

84
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,380
Speaking hypothetically...

85
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,640
If you happened to be my target,

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,450
I wouldn't show any mercy.

87
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,250
Naturally.

88
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,720
If you happened to be my target,

89
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,450
I would say the same.

90
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,960
Am I your target?

91
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,460
I was speaking hypothetically.

92
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,750
Oh, right...

93
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,060
Don't worry.

94
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,330
You are not my target.

95
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,720
I-I see...

96
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,220
And you aren't my target!

97
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,050
Yo.

98
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,910
What number did you draw?

99
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,680
How about you?

100
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,820
Secret.

101
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,760
Don't worry.

102
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,300
You aren't my target.

103
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,800
And my target isn't you.

104
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,090
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?

105
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,310
Okay!

106
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,310
Ready, and...

107
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,160
#44 is...

108
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,820
Seriously?

109
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,510
You have really bad luck...

110
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,430
You think so?

111
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,880
Who's #199?

112
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,030
You don't know, either?

113
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,880
Uh-uh.

114
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,250
I didn't bother to memorize
everyone's numbers.

115
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,920
After the initial explanation,

116
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,070
I started checking tags,

117
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,790
but everyone had already removed them.

118
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,270
That's so lame...

119
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,580
Gon...

120
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,920
Huh?

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,970
What?

122
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,920
Are you happy?

123
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,530
Or scared?

124
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,400
Both, I guess...

125
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,130
In a straight-up fight,

126
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,550
I wouldn't stand a chance.

127
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,000
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,650
then I have a real shot.

129
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,800
Yeah.

130
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,090
Right now,

131
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,220
I might actually have a chance.

132
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,310
That scares me a little...

133
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,380
But I think it's worth it.

134
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,810
I see.

135
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,340
Well, let's do our best.

136
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,570
Make sure you stay alive, Gon.

137
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,480
Uh-huh!

138
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,860
You, too.

139
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,740
Thanks for your patience, everyone.

140
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,210
We've finally arrived at Zevil Island!

141
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,210
Now, please disembark in the order by which

142
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,840
you cleared the Third Phase.

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,930
Tsk...

144
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,100
This again.

145
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
After each person disembarks,

146
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,890
we'll wait two minutes before
the next person's turn.

147
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,290
That means we'll be waiting
here a while.

148
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,380
Yeah.

149
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,110
You will stay on this island
for exactly one week.

150
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,270
During that time,

151
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,990
you must amass your six points
of ID tags and return here.

152
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,740
All right then, the first person may start!

153
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,470
I understand...

154
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,850
Those who disembark earlier
hold the advantage.

155
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,630
Yeah.

156
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,300
They can hide and monitor

157
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,390
their target's movements.

158
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,560
Two minutes have passed.

159
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,580
The second person may start!

160
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,900
The third person may start.

161
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,650
Yeah!

162
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,650
The seventh person...

163
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,740
The eleventh person...

164
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,050
The fifteenth person...

165
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,910
The twentieth person may start.

166
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,480
Two minutes have passed.

167
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,670
The twenty-first person may start!

168
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,720
See ya.

169
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,590
Uh-huh.

170
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,550
Well,

171
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,320
guess I'll begin by scouting the island.

172
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,860
Two minutes have passed.

173
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,940
The twenty-second person may start.

174
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,020
Okay!

175
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,300
See you...

176
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,130
Yeah!

177
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,070
First, I need to find Hisoka!

178
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:39,170
Hunter Vocabulary

179
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,170
Zevil Island

180
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,010
How do I steal Hisoka's ID tag?

181
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,180
Such a good boy.

182
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,360
Very nice.

183
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,570
I'm getting excited now...

184
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,360
I won't be able to steal his tag
with a head-on attack...

185
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,740
It's another applicant.

186
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,430
And another one is behind him.

187
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,690
He's targeting the guy in front.

188
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,020
He blew it!

189
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,770
Hey, that was close.

190
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,310
Sorry, but it won't be that easy...

191
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,530
That easy...

192
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,990
Wh-What?

193
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,700
B-Bastard...

194
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,320
The arrow was coated with
a fast acting tranquilizer.

195
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,080
You won't be able to walk
for the next week.

196
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,740
Don't worry.

197
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,420
There's water nearby.

198
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,920
You won't die.

199
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,190
I'll be taking this.

200
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,800
See ya.

201
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,380
Wow.

202
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,120
He was able to mask his own presence

203
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,190
as he stalked his prey.

204
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,900
And his target was able to
sense the shot being fired,

205
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,150
and quickly dodge it,

206
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,980
avoiding serious injury.

207
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,160
However,

208
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,290
the other applicant anticipated this,

209
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,200
and poisoned his arrow...

210
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,490
This is how you hunt!

211
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,300
If I have any chance at
stealing Hisoka's ID tag,

212
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,590
this is it!

213
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,020
First, I have to sneak up on him

214
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,230
without being noticed.

215
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,730
Then I wait for my chance,

216
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,070
and steal his tag!

217
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,110
Yeah!

218
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,080
But unlike this target,
Hisoka will be moving...

219
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,800
Regardless, I'll only get one shot.

220
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,880
I have to hook Hisoka's tag

221
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,640
when he isn't paying attention.

222
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,830
Okay...

223
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,390
Read his movements...

224
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,490
Now!

225
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,750
Hmm...

226
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,800
This isn't quite right...

227
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,510
It's too easy to predict

228
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,800
how a swinging target will move.

229
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,410
That's right.

230
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,440
I shouldn't forget that Hisoka will
try to move out of the way.

231
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,540
If I can't get a bird

232
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,250
by watching how it moves,

233
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,030
I'll never be able to steal Hisoka's ID!

234
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,240
Huh?

235
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,300
Oh, well!

236
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,980
I won't catch a bird on the
first or second try.

237
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,720
There!

238
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,040
Whose number is this?

239
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,500
The sun's about to set...

240
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,720
I should probably stay in one place
until tomorrow morning.

241
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,860
Damn...

242
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,810
I didn't think it would be so hard.

243
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,380
It's too dark for me to see anything.

244
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,810
And all the birds are gone...

245
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,170
Okay...

246
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,730
I'll catch one tomorrow!

247
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,360
Right!

248
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,080
Back to training!

249
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,330
It's no use.

250
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,520
Maybe it's not possible, after all.

251
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,150
To catch a bird,

252
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,620
with accuracy, while it's in flight...

253
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,290
Birds can catch fish that are swimming.

254
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,800
Go!

255
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,690
I get it...

256
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,940
There's a moment

257
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,940
when I know exactly what
my target will do next!

258
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,090
Now!

259
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,160
I did it!

260
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,360
I figured it out!

261
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,560
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!

262
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,550
Heh.

263
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,270
He actually mastered
the art of hunting.

264
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,560
Impressive little boy...

265
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,140
But that intense concentration
will be your undoing.

266
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,690
Gon finally mastered the trick that
would help him hunt Hisoka.

267
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,610
However, Gon was also being hunted.

268
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,380
Next time: Explosion x Of x Deception!

269
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,010
Explode!

270
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,700
Explode...

271
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,800
Ka-boom!

272
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,140
Oh, mushroom.
