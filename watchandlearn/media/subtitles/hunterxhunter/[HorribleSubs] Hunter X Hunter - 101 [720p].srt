2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,520
These suction cups saved me.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,650
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,980
Don—

5
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,990
Ikalgo x And x Lightning

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,740
A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he
and Gon split up to stop the selection.

7
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,170
One of them is Ikalgo,
an octopus Chimera Ant.

8
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,750
Aren't you an octopus?

9
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,800
Don't call me an octopus!

10
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,510
See ya!

11
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,010
I need to find a new host, or
I can't charge up my next shot.

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,010
I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.

13
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,060
Yo, we meet again.

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,100
So we do...

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,130
Long time, no see!

16
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,060
Ya know?

17
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,930
Can I ask you something?

18
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,000
Sure, go ahead!

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,700
Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,390
You should have an advantage in the water.

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,210
Don't tell me you can't swim.

22
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,940
Uh, well...

23
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,080
It's the blood, right?

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,780
When they smell blood, your
buddies in the water go berserk

25
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,930
and attack the injured, no matter who it is.

26
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,740
With those wounds, if you went in there,
you'd be torn to shreds.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,510
Am I wrong?

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,990
Uh, w-well...

29
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,980
I suppose that's one way to...

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,530
Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?

31
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,490
No, we're still fighting!

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,240
Who are you talking to?

33
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,240
I screwed up!

34
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,340
Right, you all can communicate via telepathy.

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,160
Talking to your boss? It's that guy
who was flying over me, right?

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,970
Wait, now look here...

37
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,990
Uh, so...

38
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,280
Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!

39
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,510
You could say that's what I might be doing...

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,510
Yes! We're still fighting!

41
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,990
Oh, sorry to interrupt you.

42
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,760
Let me know if you learn anything.

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,680
If he sees dozens of dragonflies
flying around inside a cave,

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,220
the enemy would get suspicious...

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,020
I won't be able to send my
Satellite Dragonflies inside.

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,250
Let's make a deal, then.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,860
If you tell me about his power,
I'll spare your life.

48
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,780
You have ten seconds to answer.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,670
Eight seconds left.

50
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,970
Six seconds.

51
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,970
I wanted to be reborn a squid...

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,880
I would've given anything to have
been a Chiroteuthis imperator.

53
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,420
Do you think octopi and squid are similar?

54
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,330
If so, you're mistaken...

55
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,200
Octopi are ugly.

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,250
Squid are squidderific.

57
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,520
I think they look divine!

58
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,340
Two seconds.

59
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,700
I won't betray a buddy!

60
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,210
Yeah, I could see that in your eyes.

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,650
I can only hope

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,720
that in my next life, I'll be born a squid...

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,240
Wh—

64
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,690
Why?

65
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,620
Because you're a cool guy.

66
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,130
In different circumstances,
we could've been friends.

67
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,930
You lowered your guard!

68
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,310
Didn't think fish could jump, eh?

69
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,650
I'll crush you and the rock behind you!

70
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,880
Come in, Ikalgo.

71
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,930
Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!

72
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,630
Has he used any weapons or special abilities?

73
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,950
Ikalgo!

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,640
No, he's been fighting...

75
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,870
with only his bare hands.

76
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,630
Come on... Beg for your life.

77
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,720
Otherwise, it's no fun!

78
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,050
Or are you in too much pain to talk?

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Yeah, this is a relief.

80
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,940
Huh?

81
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,610
Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.

82
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,640
Huh?

83
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,190
I have no qualms about killing you.

84
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,290
Yep! He was just a scumbag!

85
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,450
That's why he was the decoy!

86
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,980
I did it, Ortho-sama!

87
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,990
I've attached the badge!

88
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,760
Coburn pulled it off!

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,570
Time to start the game.

90
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,850
Let's enjoy ourselves.

91
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,590
Damn, the bleeding won't stop...

92
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,150
I need to find an exit.

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,270
A digital sound inside my head?

94
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,270
Wha—

95
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,110
What?

96
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,620
A fish? But I'm not in the water!

97
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,590
What's going on?

98
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,090
I didn't sense anything!

99
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
Again...

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,130
I didn't see anything or sense any
aura until the fish hit me!

101
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,900
What's going on?

102
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,640
This is bad.

103
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,080
I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.

104
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,650
108 points.

105
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,640
You have no idea what's going on?

106
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,960
I should say that you're
hearing my voice in your head.

107
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,660
Well, if you survive long enough,
you'll figure out what's happening.

108
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,360
These are fish made from Nen.

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
So why can't I sense them?

110
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,510
Something must be triggering
them from somewhere else.

111
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,430
That's the only possible explanation!

112
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,560
How else could I be attacked by
something I can't see or sense?

113
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,980
This is going well...

114
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,370
Well, have you determined
anything about these attacks?

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,880
Three...

116
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,590
He can only materialize three fish at once.

117
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,230
After that, the fish will disappear.

118
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,770
And the vivid colors of the
target he put on me...

119
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,310
It can only mean one thing!

120
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,350
Your power involves

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,730
darts!

122
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,400
Bingo.

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,740
That's correct.

124
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,690
But the great thing about our power
is that figuring it out won't help you.

125
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,190
Because my Nen fish darts

126
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,370
have no physical form until the
instant they pierce your flesh.

127
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,950
That makes it impossible to block them.

128
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,480
Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points.

129
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,960
I have a dart board

130
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,960
that's linked to various parts of your body.

131
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,250
For instance...

132
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,240
Your right elbow is 27 points.

133
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,480
Your right hand is 18 points.

134
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,120
99 points...

135
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,930
Hey, what's wrong?

136
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,950
I can't hear your screams.

137
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,770
Are you already dead?

138
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,820
The game's only just begun.

139
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,490
Triple 6!

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,720
4!

141
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,660
13!

142
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,940
Bravo!

143
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,680
Brother, that was magnificent.

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,130
You're on a roll.

145
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,500
Naturally...

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,770
Our lives are on the line...

147
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,510
This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.

148
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,790
The sister creates a Nen badge,

149
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,710
which activates after it's affixed to the target.

150
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,260
That links the target to the dart
board created by the brother.

151
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,560
Until the game ends, no one
can deactivate the badge,

152
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,970
not even the Ortho Siblings.

153
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,270
When the brother's darts hit the board,
the target is attacked by needlefish.

154
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,630
There is no way to avoid this attack.

155
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,410
That is because, until they've
hit the target's body,

156
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,280
the needlefish do not exist.

157
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,540
Thus, it is impossible to sense
them coming or dodge them.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,200
This is our unbeatable power...

159
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,720
Needlefish De Darts!

160
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,190
Death Games

161
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,530
Death Games
Needlefish De Darts

162
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,710
Of course, the siblings incur some risk.

163
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,880
Once the badge activates, they are invincible.

164
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,070
But if the brother misses the board with the
final dart that decides the game's outcome,

165
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,520
all of the damage the target has taken

166
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,440
will transfer to the siblings.

167
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,190
We are invincible. That is because...

168
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,240
We are bound by the
strongest trust in the world.

169
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,000
It isn't over yet...

170
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,960
Well, it seems the game's almost over.

171
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,870
Why don't you tell him that?

172
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,310
No need to be that nice.

173
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:44,470
If he were pleading for his life,
it'd be easier for me to focus.

174
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,350
Or if he were to give up
and beg me to kill him,

175
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,480
or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero
and said, "Not a bad way to die."

176
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,770
Those would help motivate me,
as I toss my darts.

177
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,490
But he'll just have to dread his impending
death, never knowing when it will end...

178
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,390
Until he dies.

179
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,420
It's not...

180
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,430
It's not over yet!

181
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,500
Damn...

182
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,570
This looks pretty bad...

183
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,930
I've lost way too much blood.

184
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,200
I could die here,

185
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,940
so no point in saving what's left.

186
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,430
Now, then.

187
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,520
It's my final turn.

188
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,320
Left ear.

189
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,620
That sure gave him a big earring.

190
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
Right calf!

191
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,420
Okay, time for the last throw.

192
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,920
My brother, I trust you.

193
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,610
I've got this.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,950
See?

195
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,960
Bravo!

196
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,820
Yay!

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,820
Yay!

198
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,330
Yay!

199
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,460
You're the best in the world!

200
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,520
I'll go check his corpse.

201
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,970
I'll come with you.

202
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,520
We should share some of the
meat with Coburn as a reward.

203
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,730
Aren't you gonna eat?

204
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,830
Can I ask you something?

205
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,740
What?

206
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,780
What made you decide to trust me?

207
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,600
It wasn't that I didn't trust you.

208
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,150
I just didn't know why you were following me.

209
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,370
And you swore that you weren't lying.

210
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,500
Huh?! That's it?

211
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,510
Isn't that enough?

212
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,530
Hell, no!

213
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,610
Liars make promises all the time!

214
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,060
A promise is the one thing
you should never trust!

215
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,890
Then you were lying?

216
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,620
I'm different...

217
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,010
I don't lie!

218
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,020
I only tell the truth!

219
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,510
Then it's okay.

220
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
I think I'm starting to lose it.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,780
He's strong, but he's just a kid.

222
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm putting my fate in the
hands of this clueless boy?

223
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,540
Besides, if you're lying, that'll
actually make things easier for me.

224
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Easier?

225
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,150
I won't have to show you any mercy.

226
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,390
I'll be free to destroy you.

227
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,910
The look... The look in the kid's eyes...

228
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,240
Yes, this is why I had a hunch...

229
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,970
There's something special about this kid.

230
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,290
I can't even tell how much
power he really has...

231
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,870
You hit him right in the forehead.

232
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,000
Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target.

233
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,560
Really? That's excellent.

234
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,060
I will tell Leol-sama that a
promotion is in order.

235
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,880
Thank you very much.

236
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,340
Great!

237
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,940
We can be assistant squadron leaders now!

238
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,660
Yay!

239
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,290
Yay!

240
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,670
Yay!

241
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,540
H-How?

242
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,650
How can you be alive with a dart
sticking out of your brain?!

243
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,010
What?

244
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,910
It's a suction cup from an octopus.

245
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,090
No way.

246
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,470
How did you manage that trick?

247
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,220
No, wait...

248
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,420
My... My darts were perfect!

249
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,630
It's absolutely impossible to stop them!

250
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah, I didn't stop it.

251
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,180
I just grabbed it,

252
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,990
the moment it materialized at my head.

253
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,970
From what you were saying, I could tell

254
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,190
you could hear my voice,
but you couldn't see me.

255
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:51,240
I had plenty of time to switch out
the needle for a suction cup.

256
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,010
H-Hold on...

257
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:01,110
No human has reflexes fast
enough to catch a dart!

258
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:06,440
Well, it wouldn't have been possible had
I not known where it would appear.

259
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,460
But I knew exactly where and
when the last dart would hit.

260
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,260
The final dart must hit the board's
outer ring per double out rules.

261
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,660
And you were playing an 01—501 game.

262
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,020
You start with 501 points,
and the goal is to reach 0.

263
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,490
These rules are used in professional competition.

264
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,930
I n-never told you what rules I was using!

265
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,210
As soon as I knew you were playing darts,
my suspicions were confirmed.

266
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,500
Remember how

267
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,320
your first dart hit double 4?

268
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,680
The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.

269
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,230
A double in...

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,200
A sign that you were confident in your skill.

271
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,290
A skilled player would play by official rules.

272
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,520
Players with talent and confidence
tend to seek public recognition.

273
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,520
After that, I just had to do the
math and endure the pain.

274
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,490
I subtracted your points from 501,

275
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,750
and waited until your score was under 40.

276
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,280
At that point,

277
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,950
I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead.

278
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,790
That's all it took.

279
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,160
To improve his reflexes, Killua changed
his aura into electricity.

280
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,430
When the dart touched his skin,

281
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,460
the sensation did not travel

282
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,630
from his skin to his brain
using the nervous system.

283
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:48,060
He used Nen to ensure that, as soon
as the aura registered the dart,

284
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,690
it sent a message directly to his
left hand, to grab the dart.

285
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,690
Do you have some history with darts?

286
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,760
At age six, I mastered the game.

287
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,310
I've counted down from 1,440 points.

288
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,450
It was part of my early training.

289
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,440
It's your fault for getting cocky
and talking too much!

290
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,440
Or was I seven?

291
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,240
You're so stupid!

292
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,550
Guess it doesn't matter...

293
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!

294
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,610
I talked too long.

295
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,210
I need to hurry!

296
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,720
Huh?

297
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,700
What?

298
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,990
My body won't do what I tell it to...

299
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,490
Wait, is this really happening?

300
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,690
Wow...

301
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,610
All this is my blood?

302
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,760
It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.

303
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,570
Wait, this isn't the time to think about that...

304
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,360
I should get going.

305
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,520
Crap... Now I feel cold...

306
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Damn...

307
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,610
And after that last fight gave me a hint...

308
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,010
for improving my power.

309
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,630
Am I...

310
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,840
going to die here?

311
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,740
Gon... Sorry...

312
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,360
I wasn't any... help...

313
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,250
Octopus...

314
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,190
Don't call me an octopus!

315
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,510
What are you doing?

316
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,850
Isn't that obvious?

317
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,800
I'm turning traitor.

318
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,220
Lame, huh?

319
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,950
Now stop talking.

320
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,340
I know a secret doctor.

321
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,270
It won't take long by underground waterway.

322
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,220
Don't die before we get there!

323
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,450
Are you an idiot?

324
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,210
I spared... your life...

325
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,740
Now they'll be hunting you...

326
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,820
I know that!

327
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,470
Don't ask me why I'm doing this.

328
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,660
But you know...

329
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,560
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...

330
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,510
After you said we could be friends...

331
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,240
I couldn't let you die!

332
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,370
I'm gonna save you!

333
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,050
Don't die on me!

334
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,220
Next time: Power x And x Games.

335
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,460
If you smoke, your teeth will turn black.

336
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm a chameleon, so I don't have teeth!
