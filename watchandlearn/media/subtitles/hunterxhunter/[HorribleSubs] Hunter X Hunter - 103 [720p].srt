2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,140
Gungi?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,760
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,250
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,160
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,410
Then, if I defeat this champion,
I'll be the best in the world?

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,250
A fitting way to end this recreation.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,710
Bring them in.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Check x And x Mate

10
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,510
Six days remain before
Neferpitou begins the selection.

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,010
The King has spent this time in his palace,

12
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,980
defeating the masters of shogi,
Go, and other board games.

13
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,580
The last remaining one,
the reigning Gungi world champion,

14
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
has just been summoned to his side.

15
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,060
U-Um...

16
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,290
Th-Thank you for infighting me—

17
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,700
For inciting me...

18
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,170
No need for small talk.

19
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,610
You and I will play Gungi.

20
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,430
Right now, I am learning the
rules, so you must wait.

21
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,130
Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.

22
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,130
He's dead.

23
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,440
Now I am the King.

24
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,390
I'm s-so sorry!

25
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,940
Please forgive me!

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,790
I'm only a fool, one who knows
nothing of the outside world!

27
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,780
I can't even talk normally...

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,830
You are distracting me. Be silent.

29
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,580
Or I'll kill you.

30
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,300
Okay, I basically understand.

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,970
Let us begin.

32
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,690
What's wrong?

33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,690
It appears she's passed out.

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,670
After you told her to be quiet,
she shut her mouth...

35
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,580
Then, since her nose was stuffed up,
it seems she was unable to breathe.

36
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,950
This is an uncommonly stupid girl.

37
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,700
Yeah, that was embarrassing!

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,830
I can't even do things a baby can.

39
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,560
My parents are always yelling at me...

40
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,460
Just play the game.

41
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,970
Yes!

42
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,330
I'm honored to play against you.

43
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,760
You can see with your eyes?

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,290
No, I can't see a thing.

45
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,490
So would you please tell me your moves?

46
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,030
I only open them when I play.

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,490
If it bothers you, I can try to close them...

48
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,500
I don't care.

49
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,760
The atmosphere has changed.

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,640
4-4-1, pawn.

51
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,610
You can't reach him at all?

52
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,900
No, I guess his phone is off.

53
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,530
We agreed that he would initiate all contact,

54
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

55
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,410
Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?

56
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,420
Why does that guy look like he
was born in the wrong decade?

57
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,050
And the look on his face says
he's always looking for a fight...

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,890
The other has no eyebrows,

59
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,030
and that expression makes it
clear that he trusts no one.

60
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,120
It's not even a question of
whether he and I can get along.

61
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,320
I can already see he won't believe a word I say.

62
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,520
Gon, I'm sorry to say that my
first impression is very bad!

63
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,460
Unless I get some really good news soon,

64
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,070
there's no way I'll be able to trust them.

65
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,960
I guarantee it.

66
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,460
Hey, what's all this?

67
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,670
Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess.

68
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,350
They have collars...

69
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,840
He's been feeding all the animals
left behind due to the selection.

70
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,360
He's even sacrificed sleep...

71
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm not feeding all of them!

72
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,360
I know we don't have time to waste on that!

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,600
So I abandoned those that stood no chance.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,830
That's efficient, yeah?

75
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,950
Some were just skin and bones,
but still wouldn't take my food.

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,280
Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave
their homes after I untied them...

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,720
What's so bad about saving
the ones that want the help?!

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,110
You don't have to cry about it.

79
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm n-not crying, fool!

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,980
Want me to smack you?

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
That won't be enough to raise my opinion.

82
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,090
Well, he certainly is different, though.

83
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,580
7-8-2, spy.

84
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,760
Checkmate.

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,810
She's using an orthodox approach,
stacking archers on her pawns.

86
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,020
A standard strategy.

87
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,900
Textbook execution.

88
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,780
And her initial placement
is one used with beginners.

89
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,030
Meaning that I am not good enough
for her to show her true skill.

90
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
Another game.

91
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,410
Yes, absolutely!

92
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,650
8-8-1, knight.

93
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,550
I guess that's checkmate.

94
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,600
You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader.

95
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,360
I'll have to step up my game,
or you'll get the jump on me!

96
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,570
That's enough... Go get some rest.

97
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,390
That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.

98
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,120
I can play Gungi for three days
and nights without sleep!

99
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
I have another guest.

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn.

101
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,730
Then I'll get a little rest.

102
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,940
What do you think?

103
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,850
It's but a matter of time.

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,700
There are more options to choose from,

105
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,360
but essentially, this game is
no different than the rest.

106
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,240
In four or five more games, she will
have to use her real ability.

107
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,330
Once that happens, I shall be
able to observe her rhythm.

108
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,240
Nothing has changed.

109
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,500
Your Majesty,

110
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,000
the Go player hanged himself.

111
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,110
Bring that idiot back.

112
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,000
While the King continues to play
against the Gungi master,

113
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,670
a short distance away, Morel has
been using his power to surround

114
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,790
the capital city of Peijing.

115
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,420
Purple Haze Soldiers
Deep Purple

116
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,420
Deep Purple.

117
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,180
First, he releases the aura that serves as a core.

118
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,920
He then envelops it in an aura haze,

119
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,750
creating a smoke puppet that he can
control at will via the Nen within the core.

120
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,450
His ability can sustain two hundred
and sixteen puppets at once.

121
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,930
On the chance that the enemy retaliates,
I've made my soldiers more responsive,

122
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,960
so I can only maintain fifty now.

123
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
But they're much stronger.

124
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,980
One advantage is that En can't differentiate

125
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,260
between one of these and a human.

126
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,480
But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants.

127
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,820
So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.

128
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,840
As expected, Neferpitou has recalled
the controlled humans to the capital

129
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,060
to take up defensive positions.

130
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,070
That implies the King's safety is top priority.

131
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,830
Which means that restricting the movement
of the Royal Guard is very easy.

132
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,830
However, the question is how the King will respond.

133
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,590
If we're dealing with a King who does as he
likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him.

134
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,340
And the risk of miscalculation increases.

135
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,970
But as long as they keep
these coming, we're fine.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,230
Long time, no see.

137
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,480
I've been looking for you.

138
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,480
Bah, he's gotten stronger.

139
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,850
The air about him feels totally different.

140
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,870
Knuckle's APR is gone?

141
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,490
It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either.

142
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,450
If something had happened,
Knuckle's group would have contacted me.

143
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,530
If APR is gone,

144
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,010
they have someone who can dispel Nen.

145
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,830
Or did he do it himself?

146
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,640
Let's see what they can do.

147
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,140
Whichever wins...

148
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,390
In the end,

149
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,490
I will triumph.

150
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,400
Time to return the favor.

151
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,780
First, I'll beat you down.

152
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,330
Then it's the pompadour's turn.

153
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,540
His confidence is far from baseless.

154
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,390
He must have gained a new ability.

155
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,170
I wouldn't be so certain!

156
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,670
If that ability is to exorcise Nen,
we're in trouble.

157
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,820
Knuckle and Shoot both use
hit-and-fade fighting styles.

158
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,000
Shoot does what he can to support
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.

159
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,570
But we can't nullify their Nen with ours

160
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,370
if they have someone who can dispel it.

161
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,490
A strategy that might have worked
against the King is useless now.

162
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,870
However...

163
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,980
if he has the ability to exorcise Nen,
this is a good opportunity.

164
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,880
If I neutralize him here, Knuckle
and Shoot can use their powers.

165
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,090
I must fight...

166
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,390
I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have
to get by on my remaining aura.

167
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,900
What?

168
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,400
He's still relying on speed?

169
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,280
There are plenty of ways to deal with
someone who only uses speed.

170
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,660
Now you're "It."

171
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,160
Huh? What was that?

172
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,930
Wh-Where am I?

173
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,360
A savannah?

174
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,430
Did he teleport me?

175
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,250
If this is his new ability,

176
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,900
a different Chimera Ant is the Nen exorcist.

177
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,440
That's bad.

178
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,690
Sure you should just be standing around?

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,570
It's time to start

180
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,640
this game of tag.

181
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,570
Tag?

182
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,120
We're in a field that I created.

183
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,330
Unless you touch me, you can't leave.

184
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,260
Your time limit is eight hours.

185
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,260
Let's start!

186
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Hey!

187
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,510
Didn't you hear what I said?

188
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,150
You can't leave without touching me!

189
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,910
If I chase you, I'll never catch you.

190
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,410
So I'm going to take my time.

191
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,790
Morel disappeared with the enemy!

192
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,550
Cheetu has activated his power...

193
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,560
I don't know what it does, but they
won't be back for eight hours.

194
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,560
The scenery is just a wall.

195
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,940
Looks like I'm in some kind of space
separated from the real world, like he said.

196
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,200
Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.

197
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,210
If I stopped Deep Purple, I could
break out of here with ease.

198
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,550
However...

199
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,980
First, is it even possible for me to stop
Deep Purple from within this space?

200
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,790
Second, if I'm able to stop it,

201
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,460
will that aura return to me here, in this space?

202
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:43,740
The worst scenario would be one
in which I stop Deep Purple,

203
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,840
but the aura can't reach me in this space.

204
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,370
Once Deep Purple is halted,

205
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,630
it can't be reactivated until
I've recovered the aura.

206
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,740
It's too risky to try.

207
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,870
I can't stop Deep Purple.

208
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,130
At least, not yet.

209
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,880
Are you finally ready to start?

210
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,680
This way! Follow my lead!

211
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,570
Hold on, you aren't gonna...

212
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,690
You bet I am!

213
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,300
It's a waste of time.

214
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,660
You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.

215
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,540
There's only one way out.

216
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,420
And that's to catch me.

217
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,920
I can tell that

218
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,930
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
has weakened his power...

219
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,920
So then...

220
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,010
Hey, what happens if I don't touch
you within the time limit?

221
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,940
Who knows?

222
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,940
I have no obligation to answer that question.

223
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,730
Naturally, of course not.

224
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,790
It appears there's more to this ability.

225
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,820
I'm in for the long haul, then.

226
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,580
Wake me up in five hours.

227
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,830
Are you mocking me?

228
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,380
Go ahead, lose your temper.

229
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,350
It seems you don't understand your own power.

230
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,350
This isn't a battle of speed.

231
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,300
It's a battle of mental fortitude.

232
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,380
Deep Purple is still active...

233
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,960
So the operation continues.

234
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,880
Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy.

235
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,990
It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses.

236
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,380
Anyone else around?

237
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,890
No, just the figures in white.

238
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,600
Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.

239
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,130
But it's possible that the true leader
is concealed among them.

240
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,280
And I can't let anyone see my power.

241
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,960
And Hirin is occupied with
exorcising the Nen on Cheetu...

242
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,030
Damn...

243
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,520
I need at least two more pawns!

244
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him.

245
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,550
The King is nearly finished playing games.

246
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,120
After that, the King will insist on
defeating his enemies himself.

247
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,680
We will be there to guard him, but
you never know what might happen...

248
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,190
We would rather the King remain
inside until the selection is over.

249
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,320
Do you need something?

250
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,750
Give Leol a hand.

251
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,250
Yes, as you wish.

252
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,280
Well?

253
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,450
I am becoming worried.

254
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,320
They've played many times, but
the King is nowhere near victory.

255
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,330
This player is a true master...

256
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I should have been able to break
her defenses from the left side.

257
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,850
But she used a peculiar move
sequence to turn the tables.

258
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,980
4-5-1, musketeer.

259
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,610
2-8-2, fortress.

260
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,620
What?

261
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,930
The spy has done nothing this entire match...

262
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,370
But suddenly, it controls the board!

263
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,630
My right side's been destroyed.

264
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm done. That's checkmate.

265
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,880
Impossible.

266
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,390
From start to checkmate, there were
one hundred, forty-four moves.

267
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,590
This outcome could have only happened
if she foresaw each of my moves.

268
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,770
On to the next game.

269
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,770
Yes!

270
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,980
This is utterly impossible!

271
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,030
A storm is brewing.

272
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,740
The girl's strength upsets the King.

273
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,040
And a storm draws near the palace.

274
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,290
Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.

275
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,650
Please go easy on us.

276
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,420
Clack.

277
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,130
Whack.

278
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,090
Whoosh.

279
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,030
Clang.

280
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,260
Checkmate.
