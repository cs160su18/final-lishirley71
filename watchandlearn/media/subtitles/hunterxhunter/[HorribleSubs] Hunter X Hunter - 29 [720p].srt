00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,010
Heavens Arena.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,990
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,530
When combatants win a fight,

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,420
they may advance by one class,

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,460
and receive a corresponding reward.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,030
After reaching the 100th floor,

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,170
you are assigned a private room.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,550
After reaching the 200th floor,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,690
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,010
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,880
This is the best stage

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,890
a warrior could ask for.

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,710
Only one thing can protect you

15
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,520
from someone who uses Nen.

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,020
You must also learn to use Nen.

17
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,530
You must use Ten for defense.

18
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,650
Otherwise...

19
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,750
Your body will be crushed.

20
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,750
Awakening x And x Potential

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,850
As the hour grows late,

22
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,590
Wing's lecture has reached its climax.

23
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,010
But they only have until midnight.

24
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,710
Before that time,

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,510
Gon and Killua must learn Nen.

26
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,520
Nen is a power that dwells
within every person.

27
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,840
However, at present,

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,340
only a few are capable of using that power.

29
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,490
Thus, they are treated as
geniuses, leaders, psychics,

30
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,540
mystics, or superhumans.

31
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,620
A power that dwells within everyone...

32
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,740
Yes.

33
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,040
And there are two means

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,050
by which to awaken this power.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,510
The deliberate way and the aggressive way.

36
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,550
Zushi underwent the deliberate method.

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,560
He was a quick learner, and he trained hard.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
So he was able to master Ten
in a very short time.

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,620
In about six months.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,620
That's too long...

41
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,570
We need to learn Ten,

42
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,570
and pass Hisoka's Nen barrier before midnight!

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,890
Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.

44
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,580
Will it be fast enough?

45
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,060
That will depend on you.

46
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,860
Can you learn to hold your aura within
your body, before time runs out?

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
That is the key.

48
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,060
I will now direct my aura toward you.

49
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,730
This is known as Hatsu,
which I demonstrated earlier.

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,840
Naturally, I will restrain myself,
since my objective is not

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,730
to destroy your bodies.

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,310
However, this way is still perilous.

53
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,360
In other words, I will attempt
to shock you into awakening.

54
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,450
I will give your sleeping body a jolt,

55
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,370
so you can learn Ten more easily.

56
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,570
I say that your body sleeps because

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,740
your body's openings,
or micropyles, are closed,

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,370
meaning that your aura flow is stunted.

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,250
Therefore,

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,860
I will send my aura into your bodies,

61
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,130
to open your micropyles.

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
[Micropyles]
Numerous pores in the body,
which release aura.

63
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,020
Under normal circumstances,

64
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,090
you would spend a long time

65
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,590
meditating and discovering your own auras,

66
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,400
while slowly opening those apertures.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,900
Even Zushi, a natural talent,
required three months.

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,530
However, you two could do it in a week.

69
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,160
Or even sooner.

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,250
Which is why I find it unfortunate

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,010
that we have such little time to work with.

72
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,550
I don't really get it...

73
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,050
But quick and dirty is always better.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,060
This is a shady, highly frowned upon method.

75
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,180
You will be ignoring the correct procedure.

76
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,680
You could even die,

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,310
if the person using this method
were weak or evil.

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,210
But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil.

79
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,030
Right?

80
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,030
That's why I want to know...

81
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,540
Shroud   Force
Null
Act

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,040
Why would you

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,540
suddenly decide to teach us the
true four major principles?

84
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,540
Because I did not want to
squander this opportunity.

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,550
If you were to challenge the 200s,

86
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,800
with none of this knowledge,
you would suffer greatly.

87
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,930
Up there, everyone knows
how to manipulate Nen.

88
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,440
And they have a special
greeting for any newcomer

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,940
ignorant of Nen,

90
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
a Nen attack.

91
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,490
In other words, they do what I am about to,

92
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,440
but without restraint.

93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,950
They don't care, even if people die...

94
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,610
Only those who survive
are allowed to pass.

95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,950
They are the chosen.

96
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,250
However, they pay a steep price.

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,210
That's why I wanted you to be prepared.

98
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,420
Now, despite my attempts to scare you,

99
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,720
I have confidence that this
will awaken your power!

100
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,910
You have the potential.

101
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,220
As well as the ability.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,690
Put your belongings down,
take off your shirt,

103
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,840
and turn your backs toward me.

104
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,610
It's so hot!

105
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,460
And I can feel pressure, even though
Wing-san isn't touching me.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,540
This is it! That sensation...

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,710
Like something invisible and slimy,
crawling across my skin.

108
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,760
Amplify this by millions of times,

109
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,140
and it'd feel like my brother's Nen ?

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,140
I'll begin.

111
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,660
Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.

112
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
Th-This is...

113
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,550
That is your aura, or life energy.

114
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,960
You can see it now,

115
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,920
because the micropyles in your
eyes were also opened.

116
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,740
It's like smoke.

117
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,800
Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle.

118
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,800
It's rushing out from every part of my body.

119
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,450
It won't stop gushing out.

120
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,310
Isn't that dangerous?

121
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,000
This is your life energy,

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,520
so if it continues to escape,
you will grow tired.

123
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,040
If you expend all your aura,

124
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,820
you will collapse from fatigue.

125
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,570
Really?

126
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,230
Listen to me.

127
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,450
You must concentrate on keeping
your aura within your body.

128
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,450
Close your eyes!

129
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,210
Use any stance that helps you to focus.

130
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,220
Then visualize your aura flowing
like blood through your body.

131
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,720
From the top of your head,
to your right shoulder.

132
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,220
To your hand, before passing through
your legs, to the left side.

133
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,300
And now visualize that flow
beginning to ebb

134
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,980
and hovering around your body.

135
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,000
These boys are incredible.

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,420
I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance

137
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,630
would be the most effective.

138
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,410
With minimal advice, they've already
mastered the technique.

139
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,720
Magnificent...

140
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,200
And terrifying.

141
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,020
Slowly open your eyes.

142
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,640
How do you feel?

143
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,650
I feel like I'm surrounded by some
kind of warm mucus.

144
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes.

145
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,900
Continue to maintain those images.

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,800
Once you've assimilated them,
you'll be able to use Ten while asleep.

147
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,850
Next, I will use hostile Nen against you!

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,910
Previously, it would have

149
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,510
been painful for you to stand within this.

150
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,300
Yeah,

151
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,520
I understand your blizzard analogy now.

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,950
If you can fend off my Nen,

153
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,030
you'll be able to break through his barrier!

154
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,530
Here I come!

155
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,450
Welcome to the 200s.

156
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,300
It appears that I needn't bother
with the traditional greeting.

157
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,860
I can guess why you've come
to Heavens Arena.

158
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,360
You intended to train before challenging me...

159
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,070
Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here.

160
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,330
That saves me time.

161
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,250
You should avoid being overconfident
in your ability to use Ten.

162
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,980
There is much to learn about Nen.

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,210
To be honest,

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,980
at present, I feel no urge to fight you.

165
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,600
However...

166
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,750
If you manage to win a single
match in the 200s,

167
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,480
I shall accept your challenge.

168
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,310
Let's go.

169
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,490
Yeah.

170
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,790
Newcomers?

171
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,430
Looks like it.

172
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,420
Seems that they can use it.

173
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,000
Indeed...

174
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,140
Welcome to the 200s!

175
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,600
Please fill out the forms here.

176
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,300
Would you like to register for a match now?

177
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,940
In this class, there is a self-service system

178
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,110
by which you're permitted
ninety days of preparation.

179
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,620
You may choose to fight on
any day during that time.

180
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,120
Of course, you're free to fight every day,

181
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,630
and you can also wait until
the very last day to fight.

182
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,830
Once you've participated in a fight,

183
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,760
you have another ninety days to prepare.

184
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,030
However, if you don't fight before
those ninety days end,

185
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,560
you will be disqualified,

186
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,840
and your name will be struck from all records.

187
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,930
Does that mean we'll be fighting
in this class multiple times?

188
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,940
Yes,

189
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,680
you need ten wins to clear this floor.

190
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,240
However, if you lose four times before ten wins,

191
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,420
you'll be disqualified.

192
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,410
And

193
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,700
if you win ten times,

194
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,540
you have a chance to challenge
the Floor Masters!

195
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,760
The Floor Masters are the twenty-one
strongest fighters here.

196
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,110
Each claims one of the floors,

197
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,820
from 230 to 250.

198
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,250
Do you understand now?

199
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,370
If you defeat a Floor Master,

200
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,510
you become the new master of that floor!

201
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,160
Th-That's not all!

202
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,690
If you become a Floor Master,

203
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,980
you earn the right to participate in

204
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,950
the biennial celebration of
combat, Battle Olympia!

205
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,450
No reaction?

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Forget that.

207
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,830
Is there anything special about the top floor?

208
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,770
That's what you want to know?!

209
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,740
The champion of Battle Olympia

210
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,090
gets to live on the top floor!

211
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,360
It's an incredible honor.

212
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,110
A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground...

213
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,100
Don't you get it?!

214
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,050
But Killua's house is 3,700 meters
above ground, right?

215
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:25,720
A-And the champion always
receives a prize of...

216
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,100
What do you wanna do, Gon?

217
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,580
Now that I know the top floor's secret,

218
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,490
I don't care anymore.

219
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.

220
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,500
Why are you kids even here?

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,160
Well, then you'll need to win a fight.

222
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,500
But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?

223
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,420
No...

224
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm doing this!

225
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,450
I have to find out how different
these opponents are.

226
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,750
I'll need you to fill out this form, as well.

227
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,020
Okay!

228
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,530
You want something?

229
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,030
No, not really.

230
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,290
We're simply in line to register for a fight.

231
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh, I get it.

232
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,170
Gon, these guys want to fight
on the day you do.

233
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,980
I'm ready to go whenever.

234
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,350
There you go.

235
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,990
This boy has plenty of spunk.

236
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,050
Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.

237
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,600
Killua-sama will be in room 2223.

238
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,720
We will let you know which day your match is.

239
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,860
Thanks!

240
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,340
They must have gone through

241
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,780
that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.

242
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,030
If we'd gone in blind,

243
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,700
we could've ended up like them.

244
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,320
Wow! This room is huge!

245
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,170
Hey, are you listening to me?

246
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,160
The bath is squeaky clean.

247
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,820
Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!

248
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,050
Look, Killua...

249
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,050
Hey, Gon!

250
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,060
Your battle has been set
for 3 PM, March 11th!!

251
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,060
What? Tomorrow?!

252
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,310
That's fast.

253
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,950
I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.

254
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,160
But that's okay.

255
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,660
I need the experience.

256
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,910
I need to discover what I
can do with this power.

257
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,390
Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today.

258
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,530
First, we have Gon, who managed

259
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,420
to zip straight to this class!

260
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,950
His opponent will be Gido,

261
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,250
who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record.

262
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,220
Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun.

263
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,050
Ten is a purely defensive technique.

264
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,570
You have not improved
your offensive capabilities.

265
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,270
Plus, you will still take damage
from physical attacks.

266
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,310
A highly skilled Nen opponent

267
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,690
will be able to penetrate your Ten,

268
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,880
and deal a lethal blow.

269
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,200
So you should wait two months
before you start fighting.

270
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,200
During that time, I will
teach you as much as I can.

271
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,960
Sorry, Wing-san.

272
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,770
But I'm itching to fight right now!

273
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,000
Good grief.

274
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,970
That boy is a real handful...

275
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,640
And...

276
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,970
Begin!

277
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,950
Dancing Tops

278
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,450
There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!

279
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,210
He uses numerous tops to
attack his opponent!

280
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,760
Here we go...

281
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,960
Battle Waltz!

282
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,540
Clean hit!

283
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,800
Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit

284
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,090
and one point, right off the bat!

285
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,890
He's off to a rough start.

286
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,070
Damn!

287
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,910
I can use Nen

288
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,580
to keep these tops spinning
for hours, as my attack.

289
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,500
The attack pattern is so complex,

290
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,540
even I don't know what will come next!

291
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,550
Tops spinning into each other
and attacking me...

292
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,440
That small top deals damage
equivalent to a hammer!

293
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,430
Gon has begun his first battle of the
200s class, which is filled with Nen users.

294
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,090
The 200s class is nothing like he expected.

295
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,720
Can Gon survive this predicament?

296
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
Or not?

297
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

298
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

299
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,660
Coming up, we have Gon

300
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,490
and Killua's

301
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,280
Hunterpedia!

302
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

303
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,570
It's Gon

304
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,400
and Killua's

305
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
Hunterpedia!

306
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:19,580
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

307
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,810
Today, we introduce Gido!

308
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,490
A Heavens Arena 200s-class
fighter who is Gon's first
opponent.

309
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,110
He fights with Nen-controlled tops.

310
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,430
He may even turn himself into one, and spin into you!

311
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,580
An enhancer, who plays
while he fights.

312
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,870
Spin round and round...

313
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,100
Next time: Fierce x And x Ferocious!

314
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,780
Don't be too reckless.

315
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,220
A real friend would support
my reckless behavior.

316
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,560
That's just reckless.
