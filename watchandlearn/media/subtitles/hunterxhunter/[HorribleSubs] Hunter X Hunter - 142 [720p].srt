2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,990
You removed the needle, didn't you?

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,860
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,860
I feel a lot better.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,360
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,590
Kill?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,490
Me?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,960
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Family is off limits.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,010
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,040
They're all thinking

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,160
the same thing!

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,680
Fine...

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,470
I'll beat you at your own game.

15
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Needles x And x Debt

16
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,740
To save Gon, Killua is heading
for the city with Alluka.

17
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,820
Hisoka, who is working with Illumi to kill Alluka,

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,310
confronted Gotoh and the other
butlers escorting them.

19
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,440
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...

20
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,520
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.

21
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,260
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.

22
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,270
He must have used his power.

23
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,540
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.

24
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,500
You've said too much.

25
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,800
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!

26
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,060
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.

27
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,810
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.

28
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,320
Rubbish!

29
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,830
Catch.

30
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,360
Were my eyes just accustomed
to your attack that time?

31
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,840
It looked slower.

32
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,840
Yeah, it was a lot slower.

33
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,600
Because I diverted some
power to make them spin.

34
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,370
If you don't release your ability,
you'll be strangled by your own aura.

35
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,270
Or would you prefer your body riddled with holes?

36
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,380
Pick your poison.

37
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,630
Bungee Gum, undo.

38
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,740
He dodged my attack from that position?

39
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,980
He's fast.

40
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,410
I can't follow him!

41
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,990
I sent my gum out with the first card...

42
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,600
So it would be ready to activate anytime

43
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,770
after I removed the gum from my feet.

44
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,480
Now,

45
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,780
this evil magician has a lethal pop quiz for you.

46
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,450
I took twenty-two coins from your attack.

47
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,440
How many coins will I return to you?

48
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,200
He's going to use the gum to send
the coins flying back at me?

49
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,200
You will have to find out for yourself.

50
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,710
Gum, undo.

51
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,320
You shouldn't underestimate me.

52
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,450
Even if the answer is greater than twenty-two,

53
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll shoot them all down!

54
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,120
The answer is

55
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,670
enough to kill you.

56
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,590
A lethal pop quiz doesn't
need to be answered.

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,950
Forty kilometers until we reach the next town.

58
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,720
I should last that long...

59
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,130
Alluka, you're gonna feel a little zap again.

60
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,960
Okay, it's fine.

61
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Godspeed!

62
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,460
Speed of Lightning!

63
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,280
Very impressive...

64
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,940
If he runs at that speed on pavement,
I won't be able to catch up on my own.

65
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Amane, it's me.

66
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,000
Master Killua is headed for Parasta.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,960
I need you to follow the road.

68
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,240
Canary, come with me.

69
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,620
With my grandmother's motorcycle,
it'll be faster with two riders.

70
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,490
This is...

71
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,820
My grandmother.

72
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,890
Hang on tight.

73
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,540
We'll be using our auras as fuel,

74
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,510
so this will be more tiring than if you were to run.

75
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,700
Be prepared.

76
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,400
Here we go.

77
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,430
Found them.

78
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,140
Seriously?

79
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,930
I know I'm carrying Alluka,

80
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,190
but Speed of Lightning is at full power!

81
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,390
Damn!

82
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,450
If I go this way,

83
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,610
you can't follow on a motorcycle!

84
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
What now?

85
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,880
We'll beat him there.

86
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,960
Beat him where?

87
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,480
At Master Killua's speed, it'll take less
than ten minutes to reach Parasta.

88
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,440
It'll take Master Illumi over twenty minutes by car.

89
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
What will he do with his ten-minute lead?

90
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,870
Disguise himself?

91
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,800
Wrong. Cute answer...

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,230
Though not impossible, I suppose.

93
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,390
What's the first thing Master Killua
will want to do after he loses us?

94
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,080
Contact his friends.

95
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,610
Bingo.

96
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,930
And how can he contact his friends
without us finding out?

97
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,620
Um...

98
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,920
He'll need to check for any
tracing or listening devices,

99
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,870
and use someone else's phone.

100
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,490
That's mere common sense.

101
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,460
Think about what matters in this situation!

102
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,780
We may know where Master Killua is,

103
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,410
but if we can't get near him,
we won't know what he's doing.

104
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,470
So where is he going?

105
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,480
You've figured it out?

106
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,060
Let's go, then!

107
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,880
We've been waiting for you.

108
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,310
Damn, you guys aren't bad.

109
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,660
We've already prepared an airship.

110
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,550
Great, how many?

111
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,680
Huh?

112
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,250
Sounds like you only have one.

113
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,650
Are you serious about this?

114
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,720
Without at least five or six airships heading
to different places, we'll never lose Illumi!

115
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,160
Split up, and make the arrangements.

116
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,790
This airship will take us to our destination.

117
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,940
Is that okay?

118
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,730
Yes.

119
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,790
We'll have to pay for two tickets,
or they'll figure out it's unmanned.

120
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,250
I know that! Do you take me for a fool?

121
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,770
What does this say?

122
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,140
Ask the clerk.

123
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,110
What names should we put the tickets under?

124
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,090
Look, can't you do anything by yourself?

125
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,570
Where's Master Killua?

126
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,880
Crap!

127
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,570
Hey! You were pestering me as a distraction,
weren't you? You helped them escape!

128
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,770
What are you talking about?

129
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,370
We have to follow them!

130
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,670
I'll let you handle that.

131
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,270
Once I've dispatched the other
flights, I'll ride one of them.

132
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,330
If you follow them on the ground,
be sure you aren't followed.

133
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,860
What are you talking about?

134
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,840
If you follow them by air, it'll be more obvious!

135
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,010
That wasn't my plan.

136
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,660
I can serve as a decoy.

137
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,960
And since I plan to join up with Gotoh,
it'll be easier to move by airship.

138
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,760
What is it?

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,890
The real you is pretty cute.

140
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,020
I'm sure that Master Killua will
like you more that way.

141
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,320
A-Are you making fun of me?

142
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,370
Nope.

143
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,370
I really mean it.

144
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,440
Gotoh...

145
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,650
Hello? It's me, Killua.

146
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,060
Oh, what happened?

147
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,520
I was getting worried.

148
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't get in touch with Gotoh-san.

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,660
Got it. I'll try calling him.

150
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,000
Your older brother wants to
kill your younger brother?

151
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,040
Yeah.

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,570
Alluka's the only one who can heal Gon.

153
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,050
But Illumi wants to kill Alluka.

154
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,230
Because he thinks that my wish may
end up wiping out the entire family.

155
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,820
We were too late...

156
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,300
Why don't we just wait for
them around the hospital?

157
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,130
The closer we get to the hospital,
the more likely we are to fail.

158
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,580
Killua's friends will be in the vicinity.

159
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,090
And if we just hang around waiting,
they'll realize something isn't right.

160
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,340
Eight... We need more people.

161
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,330
Will you bring in more allies?

162
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,320
But I'm pretty shy...

163
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,990
No, I have no more allies.

164
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,860
Seems like a waste, but I guess I'll use my needles.

165
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,870
That's some nice aura.

166
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,080
If I stick them in someone and give orders,
they'll work hard for me until death.

167
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,890
Though, they usually die from working too hard.

168
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,430
Grant a wish?

169
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,760
That's a pretty scary power.

170
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,020
If segregationists knew about
that, they'd be all over it.

171
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,470
Illumi will probably follow the airships by ground.

172
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,530
My butlers have dispatched seven decoys.

173
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,820
My brother doesn't usually rely on others,

174
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,840
so he'll probably use Needlemen.

175
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,530
Needlemen?

176
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,660
He uses special needles, which carry Nen,

177
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,700
to create soldiers that fight to the death for him.

178
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,320
He sacrifices ordinary civilians to do it.

179
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,800
Illumi's powerful aura enters
the victims through the needles,

180
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,960
so the moment they're pierced,
they turn into vegetables.

181
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,130
Morel, I need you to get some Hunters

182
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,700
to take the Needlemen into custody.

183
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,050
If we have proof that he's harmed
multiple innocent civilians beyond recovery,

184
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,340
then it's okay to hunt him down,
even if he's a pro Hunter, right?

185
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,350
Killua sought this confirmation because of
what the fourth Hunter Commandment said.

186
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,220
Hunter Commandment #4...

187
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,440
A Hunter may never target another Hunter.

188
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,010
However, this does not apply to Hunters
who commit heinous criminal acts.

189
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,660
I believe some of the candidates were talking about

190
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,760
changing the Commandments and Hunter Exam.

191
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,630
If we catch Illumi,

192
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,740
a lot of people who agree with
those views will come forward.

193
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,870
Killua, are you really going to sell your brother out?

194
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,270
I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt Alluka.

195
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,390
Not even if he's my own brother.

196
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,010
I'll do whatever it takes

197
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,520
to crush him.

198
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,740
I understand.

199
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,320
Teradein and Bushidora will
probably agree to help.

200
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,900
There should be many Hunters
who will gladly lend a hand.

201
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,550
Since you're coming to the city
where the Hunter Association HQ is,

202
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,500
you'll be right under our noses.

203
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,160
But I'll make sure everyone understands
how dangerous our opponent is.

204
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,670
The mission will be to secure the
Needlemen, not to go after Illumi.

205
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,030
Yeah, that's fine.

206
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,060
I've accessed Parasta Airport's flight records.

207
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,270
There are six airships landing within twenty
to thirty kilometers of the hospital.

208
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,370
We don't know where Killua
and his butlers will land.

209
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,010
And Illumi can't pursue what he can't see.

210
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,330
Illumi and the Needlemen will try to
stay in visual range of the airships,

211
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,530
as they follow on the ground.

212
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,150
They will be vulnerable to attack
at a number of points before

213
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,180
they reach Swaldani City, where the hospital is.

214
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,530
So we need to send Hunters to those points.

215
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,950
Our top priority is recovering the Needlemen.

216
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,100
We can confirm if there are needles afterward.

217
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,550
Capture anyone who approaches the airship!

218
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,460
Yes, sir!

219
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,350
Be on your way!

220
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,480
Go!

221
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,830
Hisoka, can you dispose of the fakes for me?

222
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,240
Okay.

223
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,530
I will be busy.

224
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,750
I always knew the fourth Commandment
was fundamentally wrong.

225
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,720
We can't wait for a villain like this to appear!

226
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
The Association's honor will be sullied.

227
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,390
The exam needs to be more strict.

228
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,170
If they were required to behave
properly before joining,

229
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,360
we wouldn't have this problem.

230
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,650
So the time has come...

231
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,180
For the three of us, the anti-chairman faction,

232
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,650
to leave the Association.

233
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,650
Heart Is Valuable

234
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,650
Hello, everyone.

235
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,410
Today, I—Teradein—Loupe, and
Bushidora have joined forces.

236
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,200
We three are commonly known
as the anti-chairman faction,

237
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,420
but that is not a name of our choice.

238
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,920
The Hunter souls within us were inherited
from the former chairman, I assure you.

239
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,910
And so, to carry out his will,

240
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:14,150
we seek to reform the highly versatile team
to which the former chairman belonged,

241
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,690
Seirin Group

242
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,680
the legendary Seirin Group.

243
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Teradein, the leader.

244
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,340
Loupe, the second-in-command.

245
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,950
And I, Bushidora, will serve
as captain of the troops.

246
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,950
In this election, as an expression of our solidarity,

247
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,460
we request that all votes go
to Teradein, the leader.

248
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,650
We hope that everyone who agrees

249
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,840
with our message will vote
for our comrade Teradein.

250
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,980
Now, as we address our message,

251
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,230
we have received trustworthy
information from a reliable source

252
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:06,070
stating that multiple parties have found
a certain Hunter guilty of many foul crimes.

253
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,500
We are currently pursuing this Hunter.

254
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:22,550
let us come together to rebuild the
Hunter Association with wisdom and integrity!

256
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,720
And so, the conflict within
the Zoldyck family over Alluka

257
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,040
grows in intensity as it now involves
the Hunter Association chairman election.

258
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,380
Teradein and his allies seek
to control the Association.

259
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,720
As the election continues,
Illumi manages to capture Killua.

260
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,240
Next time: Sin x And x Claw.
