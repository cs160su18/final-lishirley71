1
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,279
Rin.

2
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:35,221
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

3
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:41,352
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

4
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:47,733
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

5
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:54,448
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

6
00:01:54,532 --> 00:02:00,621
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

7
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:08,295
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

8
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,590
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

9
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,635
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

10
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:20,558
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

11
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:26,188
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

12
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,984
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

13
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:36,740
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

14
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:42,830
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

15
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,304
Hey!

16
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,516
You shouldn't gang up on someone
to bully them!

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,101
You suck!

18
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,644
You really suck!

19
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,272
What's your problem, Tohsaka?
This doesn't concern you.

20
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,568
In that case, why don't you
do the same thing to me?

21
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,279
Then it will concern me.

22
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,282
Hey.

23
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,618
This is lame!

24
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:24,872
Here!

25
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,838
You used too much mana at once.

26
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,299
Maintain a calm mind.

27
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:41,305
In order to control magic,
you must first control your mind.

28
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:51,649
Lose control, and the mana will
rebound back to your body.

29
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,110
Too much power, or power
in the wrong form,

30
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,280
...will endanger not only you,
but those around you, as well.

31
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,784
Strive to consistently maintain
the proper flow.

32
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,411
That is the Tohsaka family motto.

33
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,583
It means always remaining
reserved and elegant.

34
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,799
You shouldn't let them get away with it
when they try that stuff, Kotone.

35
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,844
If they're in the wrong,
you have to get mad.

36
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,515
You're amazing, Rin. The way you always
speak your mind like that.

37
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,852
It's not amazing.
I think it's normal. It's only natural.

38
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,274
<i>That's right... It's only natural.</i>

39
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,741
Hold out your hand.

40
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,164
Father, teach me more!

41
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,293
How do I make something like this?

42
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,463
Well, that might be difficult
for you right now.

43
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,135
But if you work hard every day,

44
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,220
you'll be able to make it eventually.

45
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,517
After all, you're a daughter of
the Tohsaka family.

46
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:21,030
Hey, Rin... Can you show me
how to do this part?

47
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,823
Of course. Which part?

48
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,408
Me, too!

49
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,367
- Me, too.
- And me...

50
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,038
This was on page 23
in the textbook.

51
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,416
You just did the math wrong here.

52
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,253
For this problem...
It's just like this example, see?

53
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,259
Kotone?

54
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,262
Have a seat.
I'll help everyone in turn.

55
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,264
Okay!

56
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,744
Do I have to go live
with the Zenjos?

57
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:14,249
Once the Holy Grail War begins,
it will no longer be safe here in Fuyuki.

58
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,505
I want to help you win
the Grail War...

59
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,464
Rin...

60
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,384
You mustn't cause trouble
for your father.

61
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,594
Are we in the way?

62
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,513
Not at all.

63
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,184
This time, I'll need to make extra
preparations for the battle.

64
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,481
Those preparations include
ensuRin! your safety.

65
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,902
And for me to do that,
you shouldn't stay in Fuyuki.

66
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,365
I'm certain there's something
I can do to help!

67
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,209
<i>That's right...
I just haven't learned how to yet.</i>

68
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,379
<i>So all I need to do is
study on my own.</i>

69
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,344
I-I don't understand
any of this...

70
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,514
What is this? Jeez!

71
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,030
<i>Du, wer die Tür geöffnet hat,
wird Freunde sein.</i>

72
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,365
I have to close it.

73
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,242
<i>Fiir die Aussage, nimm meine Hand,</i>

74
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,995
<i>...wir weden in meinem Zimmer treffen.</i>

75
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,872
It won't move!

76
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,834
<i>Sind deine Hände klein?
Gross? Schlank? Steif?</i>

77
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,252
Rin!

78
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,171
- Jede Hand ist dankbar.
- Are you all right?

79
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,298
<i>Ich will sie erhalten.</i>

80
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,633
<i>I ch schneide sie vorsichtig...</i>

81
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,891
It's still too soon for you
to read this book.

82
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,518
Some things in this world...

83
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,646
...contain their own mana.

84
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,113
This is called a mana compass.

85
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,532
Normally, it doesn't point to anything.

86
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,243
But if there are mana traces
in the area...

87
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,414
Rin, try generating mana in this.

88
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,415
Okay.

89
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,423
See? Like this.

90
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,884
And with that book...

91
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,180
Anything that provokes
a reaction like that...

92
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,974
...is beyond your ability,
so take care.

93
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,104
I'll give this to you.
As an early birthday present.

94
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,858
Th-Thank you, Father!

95
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,988
Once the Holy Grail War ends,
we'll try some real jewel magic.

96
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,619
<i>And then, strange things
began to happen.</i>

97
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,965
They said we have study hall again...

98
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,137
There was another kidnapping
on the news this morning.

99
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>In Fuyuki City, the sudden
disappearances of children...</i>

100
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,685
The teachers have been
in a meeting all day.

101
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,646
- They said we won't have fifth period today.
- All right!

102
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,231
But they said we should stay home.

103
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,148
Why?

104
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,650
Another kidnapping...

105
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,652
They said only children
have been kidnapped.

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,195
HEY, did you hear?

107
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,785
Apparently, there's no body
inside the coffin.

108
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,413
It was in such bad shape?

109
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,416
It definitely happened
in Fuyuki, right?

110
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,050
U-Uh, my name is Tohsaka,

111
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,678
- ...and I'm in Kotone's class...
- The person you have called is not home.

112
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,931
Please leave your message
after the beep.

113
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,198
<i>Please be safe...</i>

114
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,577
<i>Kotone...</i>

115
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,257
This is Fuyuki at night...

116
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,473
It's completely different
than duRin! the day.

117
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,851
It's really creepy...

118
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,856
What is this?

119
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,109
I've never seen it do this.

120
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,739
Does this mean there are traces
of magic all over?

121
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,202
I have to find Kotone!

122
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,414
Someone out with their kid
this late?

123
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,376
What was that?

124
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,695
Oh, “Q!

125
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,292
That was close... If I'm spotted,
they'll take me home.

126
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,634
You've gotta walk, kid.

127
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,728
<i>Two of them?</i>

128
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,693
He has more kids.

129
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,695
Why?

130
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,533
<i>Wait... Why am I hiding?</i>

131
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,745
<i>I can't accomplish
anything this way!</i>

132
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,074
No one's here?

133
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,674
H-Hey!

134
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,093
Kotone!

135
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,512
Kotone! Kotone!

136
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,473
Something's been done to her?

137
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,268
What do I do?
There has to be something...

138
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,445
What have we here?
Are you lost?

139
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,489
No... Um...

140
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,241
Perfect timing.

141
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,204
We're just about to get
the party started.

142
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,832
We still don't have
enough guests, though.

143
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,085
You wanna help?

144
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,345
The more the merrier, right?

145
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,514
No!

146
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,975
What was that?

147
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,269
Don't run from me.

148
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,404
<i>He's controlling them
with that bracelet?</i>

149
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,625
Ow!

150
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,377
I have to destroy it!

151
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,180
What? So you are gonna help me?

152
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,874
Huh? What?

153
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,920
<i>You used too much mana at once.</i>

154
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,215
I can destroy this!

155
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,468
What?!

156
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,644
Kotone!

157
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,064
<i>Rin</i>

158
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,566
What's going on?

159
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,155
There's no time to cry! Run!

160
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,408
Hey! Wait!

161
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,076
Oh!

162
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,661
Man...

163
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,207
I hope the big guy
won't be too pissed.

164
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,215
Huh?
Where's Rin?

165
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,678
What a relief...

166
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,098
I should start back.

167
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,643
I did it, Father.

168
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,022
What?

169
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,117
<i>Anything that provokes
a reaction like that...</i>

170
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,495
<i>...is beyond your ability, so take care.</i>

171
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,401
Rin...
I can't believe she went to Fuyuki...

172
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:38,743
Rin!

173
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,455
Rin...

174
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,416
Rin is fine. She's just asleep.

175
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,965
Kariya...

176
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,426
What is this?
What's happening here?

177
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,512
What are you doing here?

178
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,101
Your face...

179
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,313
Behold the family magic
of the Matous.

180
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,858
You offer your flesh,
and your life is slowly devoured.

181
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,027
That is the magic's price.

182
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,197
But Sakura will be fine.

183
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,534
I'll save her
before this happens to her.

184
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,996
Zouken's only desire
is the Grail.

185
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:28,042
He promised if I win it for him,
he'll release Sakura.

186
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,253
The Grail?

187
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,716
Yeah, so don't worry.
My Servant is the strongest.

188
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,509
He won't lose to anyone.

189
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:42,307
Hope would be nothing but
cruel torture to Sakura right now.

190
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,727
So since she can't do it herself,
pray in her place.

191
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,355
For my victory.
For Sakura's future.

192
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,611
Kariya, you...

193
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:02,410
Someday, I'm sure we'll all play
in this park, just like we used to.

194
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,539
And Rin and Sakura will be sisters again,
just like they used to be.

195
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,625
SO,

196
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,294
...you don't need to cry anymore.

197
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,175
Kariya... Do you intend to die?

198
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,010
After you kill Tokiomi?

199
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,432
Mother?

200
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,267
Rin!

201
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,311
I was so worried...

202
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:33,524
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

203
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,443
I'm sorry...

204
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:41,449
Master Kirei, are you certain
that you wish to allow...

205
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,826
...Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife
and daughter to go free?

206
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,495
It's fine.

207
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,457
Continue monitoRin! Berserker's Master.

208
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,334
Understood.

209
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,063
<i>It wasn't much, but I did
manage to do something.</i>

210
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,984
<i>I guess I'm not a full-fledged mage yet.</i>

211
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,236
<i>I passed out halfway through.</i>

212
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,906
<i>That means I need to work harder.</i>

213
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,535
<i>But that's just for now.</i>

214
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,496
<i>I have plenty of time.</i>

215
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,709
<i>And someday,
I'll fight as a Tohsaka mage.</i>

216
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,586
<i>I'll have to practice really hard
and obey my father,</i>

217
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,756
<i>...so that I'll be ready
when that day comes.</i>

218
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,843
<i>And when the time comes,</i>

219
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,263
<i>...I'll do what I can to the best of
my ability as elegantly as I can.</i>

220
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,982
Episode 10:
Rin's Big Adventure

221
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:04,240
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

222
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:13,041
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

223
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:28,056
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

224
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:36,314
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

225
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:45,406
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

226
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,746
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

227
00:22:52,288 --> 00:23:00,421
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

228
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:07,345
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

229
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:15,436
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

230
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,861
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

231
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,325
A weak king is even worse
than a figurehead!

232
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,536
Of what worth is a king who fails
to protect the powerless?

233
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,329
We stand to lose nothing.

234
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,123
A Reality Marble?

235
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,750
I shall have to kill you myself.

236
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,045
Your goal was supposed to
be world conquest!
