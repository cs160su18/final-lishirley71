1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,506
By my third Command Seal,
I order you again...

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,842
Stop!

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,971
Saber, destroy the Grail.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,232
<i>How could I hope to know a man
from three commands alone?</i>

5
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:29,071
<i>I never even knew
the hearts of those...</i>

6
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,283
<i>...who served me
more closely than any others.</i>

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,787
<i>Perhaps all this...</i>

8
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:42,501
<i>...was a punishment meted out to a king
who cannot understand others...</i>

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,459
That's...

10
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,188
Impossible...

11
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,690
It's impossible!

12
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,512
Kiritsugu...

13
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,932
What's wrong, Ilyasviel?

14
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,186
I had a scary dream.

15
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,313
A dream...

16
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,276
...where I became a cup...

17
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:37,408
And inside me,
these seven big lumps appear.

18
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,203
It feels like they'll
tear me apart.

19
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,205
It's really scary.

20
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,542
But I can't run away...

21
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:52,339
Then I hear Lord Justeaze's voice.

22
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,553
Above my head,
a big black hole opens up.

23
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,224
And then, the world burns.

24
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:08,022
Kiritsugu looks at it and cries.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,237
Mother, is Kiritsugu okay?

26
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,241
Is he scared and alone?

27
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,243
It's okay.

28
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,038
He's doing his best for you.

29
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,167
He'll make sure our
prayers are realized.

30
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,297
So you'll never have
to be scared again.

31
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,384
Yeah...

32
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,261
That's right.

33
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,849
Kiritsugu always works hard.

34
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:50,147
He'll finish his important work,
and he'll come home soon.

35
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,032
Hey, Sakura...

36
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,284
Uncle?

37
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,913
I'm here to save you.
It's okay now.

38
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,250
Let's go.

39
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,961
Sakura!

40
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,547
Sakura! Sakura! Sakura!

41
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,222
Kariya...

42
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,311
Aoi.

43
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,314
Thank you, Uncle Kariya!

44
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,192
Thank you...

45
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,572
Daddy Kariya!

46
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,964
Fool...

47
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,510
That's what happens when
you disobey Grandfather.

48
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,350
Where am I?

49
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,520
You're a difficult man
to look after.

50
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,776
Digging you from the rubble
was quite troublesome.

51
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,655
Gilgamesh, what happened?

52
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,365
Who can say...

53
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,452
That mud spit me out.

54
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,788
I imagine it to be a
message from Heaven,

55
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,958
...that I should return
to this age to rule the world.

56
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,712
So you have achieved incarnation?

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,631
Infuriatingly enough.

58
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:45,512
I can't believe we struggled over
that thing as a wish-granter.

59
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:52,102
This play remained a farce
to the very end.

60
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,357
I was shot...

61
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,155
I have no heartbeat...

62
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:09,453
Did you somehow heal me,
Gilgamesh?

63
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,539
I couldn't say...

64
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,042
To my eyes,
you do seem dead.

65
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,921
But we were connected
by our pact.

66
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,257
When I regained flesh
within that ooze,

67
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:27,262
...perhaps you were trapped in some
sort of nonsense of your own.

68
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,434
You're saying it granted me life?

69
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,562
All the other Servants are gone,

70
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,524
...so we are the ones who
have won the Grail.

71
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:43,320
Kirei, behold the result.

72
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,075
If the Grail truly grants
the Victor's wish...

73
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,327
...Kirei Kotomine,

74
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:55,124
...what you see is exactly
what you most desired.

75
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,973
What?

76
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,808
What am I?

77
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,227
What manner of evil?

78
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,146
What manner of cruelty?

79
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,940
This is my wish?

80
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,152
This destruction and tragedy?

81
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,487
This is my joy?

82
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,657
Could something so twisted
and corrupt...

83
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,162
...truly have sprung from
Risei Kotomine's seed?

84
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,084
Impossible.
It is impossible!

85
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,338
Did my father sire a cur?

86
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,346
Are you satisfied now, Kirei?

87
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,641
No, not yet.

88
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,436
This isn't enough.

89
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:05,861
Yes, it is true that my life of questions
has found its answer.

90
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:10,365
But the problem-solving process
itself was skipped over,

91
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,202
...and I was simply handed
the answer.

92
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,456
How am I to accept this?

93
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,213
The formula that yielded
this strange answer...

94
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:28,759
...should exist somewhere as
a greater, clearer principle.

95
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,344
No...

96
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,222
It has to.

97
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,641
I must question.

98
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,726
I must search.

99
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,605
I must use the rest of my life...

100
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,358
...to understand it.

101
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,569
You never bore me.

102
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,072
As you like.

103
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,200
Your questions would
slay the very gods.

104
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,994
I, Gilgamesh, shall watch
you seek your answer.

105
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,416
<i>Angra Mainyu...</i>

106
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,589
<i>I will reach it again,
and next time, I will see it to the end.</i>

107
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,883
<i>Its birth.</i>

108
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,844
<i>The proof of its existence.</i>

109
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,941
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya?</i>

110
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,779
<i>I accept your challenge.</i>

111
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,548
What's wrong, Kirei?

112
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,800
Nothing.

113
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,316
<i>I remember the look
on his face...</i>

114
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,489
<i>The tears in his eyes
over finding someone alive.</i>

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,161
<i>A man filled with joy,
from the bottom of his heart.</i>

116
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,456
<i>He looked so happy,</i>

117
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:29,755
<i>...it was as though it had been him,
and not me, who had been saved.</i>

118
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,508
He's alive...

119
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,678
He's alive... He's alive.

120
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,930
<i>And then...</i>

121
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,685
<i>So fervently that, even on
the brink of death,</i>

122
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,688
<i>...I was jealous,</i>

123
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,650
<i>...he said, "Thank you."</i>

124
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,111
<i>That he was glad he'd
found someone.</i>

125
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,364
<i>That by saving even one person,</i>

126
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,242
<i>...he had saved himself.</i>

127
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,999
<i>Episode 25-.
Fate I Zero</i>

128
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,212
<i>And now, our next story.</i>

129
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:10,837
Huge Explosion in Fuyuki's New Town

130
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,422
Huge Explosion in Fuyuki's New Town
The explosion that occurred...

131
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,760
I hope that Alexei make it back
to England safely.

132
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,763
He called me this morning
from Heathrow.

133
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,557
That idiot forgot about
the time difference.

134
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,936
Oh, he called?
I didn't notice.

135
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,481
But it's just like him
to do that.

136
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,406
Hey, Grandpa and Grandma.

137
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,617
I'd like to talk to you
about something...

138
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,078
What is it?

139
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,580
Actually,

140
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm thinking of taking some
time off from school.

141
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,337
Of course, I'll talk to Dad
in Toronto about it first.

142
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,508
There's something that I want to spend
my time on more than studies at school.

143
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,759
Oh?

144
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,177
My goodness!

145
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,097
But what brought this on?

146
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,267
You aren't fed up with school
or anything, are you?

147
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,394
No, it's not that.

148
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,232
It's just that in my whole life so far,
I haven't really been interested...

149
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,192
...in anything besides studying.

150
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,445
I'm regretting that a little.

151
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,614
And so...

152
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,785
I'd like to do some traveling.

153
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,039
Oh, my...
Did you hear that, Glen?

154
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,628
Waver just said something
that sounded just like Alexei.

155
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,299
Anyway, there's a lot
I'd have to do first.

156
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,384
And I'll need money
to do it, too.

157
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,304
For starters, I was thinking
of finding a part-time job.

158
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,307
And so...

159
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,268
To make a long story short...

160
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,439
If you wouldn't mind,

161
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,902
...could I stay here until
I get things worked out?

162
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,323
Of course you can!

163
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,119
It will be so wonderful
to keep having you here!

164
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,330
We'll have to celebrate today!

165
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,589
<i>Jeez...</i>

166
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,841
<i>He's just a spirit.</i>

167
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,179
<i>So how can he leave
such a mess behind?</i>

168
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,856
<i>I really did want him
to take me with him...</i>

169
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:42,531
<i>So basically,
I'm just not there yet.</i>

170
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:54,084
He never even opened this...

171
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,268
A preorder with a bonus,
original T-shirt.

172
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,729
Does anyone even want
stuff like this?

173
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,149
Idiot...

174
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,038
I know that my
redeemer lives.

175
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:37,043
And that, in the end, He will
stand upon the Earth.

176
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:42,549
And after my skin has been
destroyed, yet in my flesh,

177
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,093
...I will see God.

178
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:50,724
I myself will see Him
with my own eyes.

179
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,934
I, and not another.

180
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,563
How my heart yearns
within me.

181
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,523
Amen.

182
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,777
Rin...

183
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:08,783
An excellent debut for
the new family head.

184
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,078
Your father would be pleased.

185
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,164
Well done.

186
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,960
You haven't quite grown accustomed
to your Crest, I see.

187
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,962
Does it hurt?

188
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,591
This is nothing.
I'm fine.

189
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,595
Tokiomi's preparations
were flawless.

190
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:33,475
I imagine that all the magics that the
Tohsaka family has accumulated...

191
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,102
...will pass to you
without incident, Rin.

192
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,899
Why don't you go fetch
your mother?

193
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,109
Yes, I'll do that.

194
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,117
Come on, Mother...
Let's say our last goodbye to Father.

195
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:57,165
Ah, Rin?
Is it someone's funeral today?

196
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,710
That's right.
Father died.

197
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,462
Oh, dear...

198
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,967
Then I should take out
Tokiomi's black suit.

199
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,346
Oh, Rin...
Help Sakura get changed.

200
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,851
What should I do?
I have to get ready, too.

201
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,855
Dear, your necktie
isn't on straight.

202
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,776
You need to look good.

203
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:29,030
After all, you're Sakura
and Rin's father.

204
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,369
I'll be leaving Japan
again for a while.

205
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,039
Do you have any
immediate concerns?

206
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,501
No! I don't need your help
for anything!

207
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,295
We will next meet
in six months.

208
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,299
At that time, I will conduct the
second Crest transplantation.

209
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,761
Take care that you are in
peak physical condition.

210
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,014
I know what to do!
You don't need to tell me!

211
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,557
Rin...

212
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,644
You are now the Tohsaka family head
both in name and reality.

213
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,941
To commemorate this day,
I'd like to offer you a gift.

214
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,446
An Azoth dagger.

215
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:14,451
When my master accepted
the results of my training,

216
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,536
...he gave this to me.

217
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,831
Now you should have it.

218
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,128
This was my father's...

219
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,115
I'm here...

220
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,618
...again.

221
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,624
Everyone...

222
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,962
Lancelot...

223
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:19,474
<i>Because I could not stop myself
from loving Guinevere,</i>

224
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,852
<i>...I was never able to
forgive myself.</i>

225
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,732
<i>But, King Arthur...</i>

226
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,820
<i>You never spoke of my sins.</i>

227
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,906
<i>You never sought atonement.</i>

228
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,617
<i>You simply continued
to stand before us...</i>

229
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,744
<i>...in your righteousness.</i>

230
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>But I desired judgment
at your hands...</i>

231
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,879
<i>Had your anger judged me,
I might not have fallen...</i>

232
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:56,678
<i>...onto the path of madness
in my quest to atone.</i>

233
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,681
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

234
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,349
I...

235
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,394
I am unworthy.

236
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,689
<i>But this much I can
say with certainty,</i>

237
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>King Arthur...</i>

238
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,779
One day, I will claim
the Holy Grail.

239
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,617
<i>You were the greatest
of all kings...</i>

240
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,664
<i>All who served you...</i>

241
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,666
It was not I...

242
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,546
<i>...felt the same way.</i>

243
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,676
...who should have been king.

244
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,062
<i>After that,
I visited the Einzberns many times.</i>

245
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,815
<i>But as I had not returned
with the Grail,</i>

246
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,612
<i>...Jubstacheit never opened
the forest's barrier.</i>

247
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,741
<i>I never saw Ilya again.</i>

248
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,204
<i>However...</i>

249
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:11,836
<i>Ilya would be the final person
I would lose.</i>

250
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,257
<i>My life was meant to
be one solely of loss.</i>

251
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:22,138
<i>But everyone is still here,
just like when we met.</i>

252
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:33,024
<i>I adopted Shirou,
the boy I saved that day.</i>

253
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,318
- Five Years Later -

254
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,611
- Five Years Later -
Hey.

255
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,572
Hey, Pops...

256
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,285
If you're gonna sleep,
do it in your bed.

257
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,870
Right...

258
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm fine.

259
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:57,715
When I was little,
I wanted to be a hero.

260
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,134
What?

261
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,303
You wanted to be?

262
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,888
Did you give up?

263
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,809
Yeah. Unfortunately...

264
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,521
Becoming a hero
has an expiration date.

265
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,358
When you grow up,
it's hard to call yourself one.

266
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,613
I wish I had realized
that sooner.

267
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,990
I see.

268
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,993
Then I guess you'll
never be one, huh?

269
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,577
No...

270
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,330
No, I never will.

271
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,590
It really is a nice moon tonight.

272
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,469
Fine.
Since you can't do it,

273
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,597
...I'll be one for you.

274
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,601
You're an adult now,
so you can't do it anymore.

275
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,855
But I still can.
Leave it to me...

276
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,984
Your dream.

277
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,703
All right.

278
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,044
I'll do that.

279
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,339
I can rest easy now.

280
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:27,889
<i>Kerry, what kind of adult do you want
to be when you grow up?</i>

281
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,891
Well,

282
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,855
...I want to be a hero.

283
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:45,281
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

284
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:51,579
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

285
00:22:51,662 --> 00:23:02,507
Kimi o erande Tatta futari no yorokobi o sagaseta nara
If I can choose you and search for happiness for us alone,

286
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:10,390
Donna tsumetai honoo ni mi o yakarete mo
we could be burned by the coldest flames

287
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:17,855
Hohoemi no chikaku
and still be smiling.

288
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:26,531
Kono sekai o Sunda mizu no naka he kaeshitai
I want to send this world back into the clear waters.

289
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:32,620
Kanashimi dake kese wa shinai
We cannot erase only sadness.

290
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:41,754
Sonna hito no kokoro no kotowari sae
I'll cut through such reasoning of the human heart

291
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:48,010
Kono te de kirisaite
with my own hands.

292
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,264
Down to zero we go
Down to zero we go

293
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:56,644
Kirei na tsuki no hikari wa
The beautiful moonlight

294
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:04,360
Tada shizuka ni Hajimari he kuchite yuku yo
is rotting away quietly towards the beginning.

295
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:09,198
Tozasareta akogare wa
The admiration locked inside

296
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:15,079
Mada tooku he Yami no naka
is still far away and in the darkness.

297
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:22,128
All those days I lived with you.

298
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:31,554
Yasashii uta
A gentle song.
