1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,180
Fionn mac Cumhaill, hero of Aillen
and leader of the knights of Fianna,

2
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:18,185
...and my daughter Gréinne
formally announce their engagement.

3
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:22,773
Everyone, tonight I want you
to celebrate!

4
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,193
That striking man with the mole
beneath his eye...

5
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,446
What is his name?

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,534
He is a knight of Fianna,
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,870
Diarmuid...

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,383
Traitor.

9
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,011
You will suffer for this, Diarmuid.

10
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,804
Take me with you.

11
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,474
And run!

12
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,821
Rejoice, Gréinne...

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,324
Fionn has recognized our marriage!

14
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:25,211
Did you believe I'd forgotten
what happened with Gréinne?

15
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,218
A dream?

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:52,279
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

17
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:58,410
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

18
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:04,792
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

19
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:11,507
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,680
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

21
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:25,396
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

22
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,691
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

23
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,694
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

24
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,658
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

25
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:43,289
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,042
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

27
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,841
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,889
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

29
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:09,064
That dream I had...
That was the legend of Diarmuid.

30
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,110
Were those my Servant's memories?

31
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
Where am I?

32
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,411
I see that you're awake.

33
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,792
Sola-Ui...

34
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,337
What is the meaning of this?

35
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,381
Wh-Why am I here?

36
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,137
You have no memory at all
of what happened?

37
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,598
I...

38
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,141
I was shot.

39
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,021
I defended myself with
the Volumen Hydragram, but...

40
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,483
What's wrong with my body?

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,071
Evidence suggests that
every Magic Circuit in your body misfired.

42
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,323
It's a miracle you didn't die instantly.

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,870
For now, all I've been able to do is
to regenerate your organs.

44
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,210
But your Magic Circuits were
utterly destroyed.

45
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,630
You'll never use magic again.

46
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,050
I...

47
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,344
I...

48
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,515
Don't cry, Kayneth.

49
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,060
It's too soon to give up.

50
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,523
We haven't lost yet.

51
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,984
Sola-Ui...

52
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,821
If the Holy Grail is truly
an omnipotent wish-granting device,

53
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:44,034
...healing you should be
more than possible for it.

54
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,120
We need only win.

55
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,208
If we succeed and claim the Grail,
everything will return to how it was.

56
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,045
With that in mind, Kayneth...

57
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,924
Give me the Command Seals...

58
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,761
I'll take over as Lancer's Master,

59
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,931
...and bring you the Grail.

60
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,392
N-No!

61
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,936
You don't believe in me?

62
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,398
In me... The woman who will marry
into the Archibald family?

63
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,067
No... But...

64
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,073
Sola-Ui, do you think Lancer...

65
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,788
...would abandon me,
to swear fealty to you?

66
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:34,335
I do. He is a Heroic Spirit,
here by the Grail's invitation.

67
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:38,505
He desires the Grail, just as we do.

68
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,467
Even if he must change Masters,

69
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,261
...he will accept it,
for the sake of his goal.

70
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,220
Sola-Ui!

71
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,891
Lancer isn't the fine man you think he is!

72
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,268
Why do you say that?

73
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:55,731
When I asked him
what he'd wish for, he said,

74
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,484
..."I have no interest in
the Holy Grail."

75
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,321
A Servant with no desire for
the Grail is categorically impossible.

76
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,074
He's hiding something important...

77
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,619
But no matter what he hides,

78
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,581
...as long as I bear these Command Seals,
he must obey me.

79
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,957
Kayneth...

80
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,628
I won't give you the Command Seals...

81
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,884
Kayneth, you still don't understand,
do you?

82
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:28,889
You don't understand that
we must win, no matter the cost.

83
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,494
Listen, Kayneth.

84
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,039
It is beyond my skills
as a spiritual healer...

85
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,293
...to forcibly remove Command Seals
once they have been bestowed.

86
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:03,674
The bearer's willing consent is the sole way
for me to take them without resistance.

87
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,510
If you truly cannot
accept this,

88
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,806
...you will leave me no choice
but to amputate your right arm.

89
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,057
What will it be?

90
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,779
Irisviel?

91
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,448
It's all right.

92
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,868
Magical healing puts
tremendous stress on the patient.

93
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,830
I think it will take time yet
before she wakes up.

94
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,625
Watch her for a while, okay?

95
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,211
You're going to report to Kiritsugu?

96
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,090
I'm sure he's worried, too.

97
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,051
Irisviel, I have a request.

98
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,889
I'd like you to speak to
Kiritsugu for me.

99
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,933
Tell him I feel that we must pursue
Caster immediately.

100
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,728
Saber...

101
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:03,150
Inaction on our part will mean
the deaths of more innocent children.

102
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,447
Kiritsugu?

103
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,372
How long before
we can use Maiya again?

104
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,627
She has to stay in bed
for another day or two.

105
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,128
I see.

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,090
You and Saber stay here.

107
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,093
I'm going to follow Kayneth.

108
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,930
Wait, Kiritsugu!

109
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,726
Did Saber tell you
we should go after Caster right away?

110
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,312
Apparently so.

111
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,234
Are you angry at Saber for
not stopping Lancer?

112
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,611
Iri...

113
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:54,034
Saving a few children, or even a few dozen,
is not our goal.

114
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,497
Saber probably never doubted that
Lancer would spare me.

115
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,750
But if Lancer had betrayed her,
what would have happened?

116
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,671
Our Grail War
would have ended right then and there.

117
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,801
There's no need to tell her
where I'm going...

118
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,434
Lancer? Please show yourself.

119
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,693
Mistress Sola-Ui,
how fares Kayneth?

120
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,529
Not well.

121
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,991
I've done everything I can, but he...

122
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,706
This isn't your fault...
It's Kayneth's!

123
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,003
All it means is that
the Grail War was too much for him.

124
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,421
It's not that, I just...

125
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:54,011
Diarmuid, he isn't worthy
to be your Master.

126
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,311
Kayneth has abandoned the battle,

127
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,813
...entrusting me with his rights
as your Master!

128
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,071
As a knight, my loyalty is
pledged to Kayneth.

129
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,368
Mistress Sola-Ui,
I cannot consent to that.

130
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,703
Wait...

131
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,458
As a Servant, do you not manifest
physically using my mana?

132
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,086
And now I have
the Command Seals, as well.

133
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,591
Before I am a Servant,
I am first and foremost a knight.

134
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,595
A knight can serve but one lord.

135
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,389
Am I so unworthy of
being your Master?!

136
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,558
I've told you
that is not the issue...

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,602
Look me in the eye
when you speak to me!

138
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:54,780
Lancer, fight beside me.
Protect me!

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,701
Lend me your support.
Win the Holy Grail with me!

140
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,245
I cannot.

141
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,625
If Kayneth has given up
his battle,

142
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,169
...then I no longer have
any interest in the Grail.

143
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,801
We require a miracle to heal him!

144
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,304
Only the Grail can perform that miracle.

145
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,891
If you truly feel responsible
for what's happened to him...

146
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,770
If you desire to give him back
his dignity as Lord El-Melloi,

147
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,107
...then you must win
the Holy Grail for your Master!

148
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,613
Mistress Sola-Ui, do you speak
as Master Kayneth's wife,

149
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,117
...and seek the Grail only on his behalf?

150
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,160
Is that correct?

151
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,455
Y-Yes... Of course!

152
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,501
Will you swear to it? And that
you have no other desire?

153
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,087
I swear.

154
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:57,801
As the wife of Kayneth El-Melloi,
I shall bring my husband the Grail.

155
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,687
<i>That look in her eyes...</i>

156
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>It is the same as Gréinne had.</i>

157
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,405
<i>I don't hate them for what happened.</i>

158
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,368
<i>However, fate was simply too cruel.</i>

159
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:31,460
<i>What I seek from this life is
the loyalty denied me in my last.</i>

160
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,465
<i>I wish to keep that sad fate
from happening once again. But...</i>

161
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:42,596
In my previous life, I threw myself
into many battles.

162
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,184
There were times when I had to ignore
the lives that would be lost.

163
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,354
That is why I can understand
Kiritsugu's reasoning in this matter.

164
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:57,027
Nevertheless, the Holy Grail War
has clear rules.

165
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,156
It is supposed to be a proxy war
over the Grail by means of Servants...

166
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,533
...to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

167
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,411
Is that not the case, Irisviel?

168
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:14,377
If Lancer's Master and Kiritsugu had
not engaged in battle in secret,

169
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,254
...we could have
struck down Caster.

170
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,550
We would no longer have to worry about
more innocent children being killed.

171
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,930
Lancer and I could have finished
our duel in an honorable fashion.

172
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,936
Is there no chance
of Kiritsugu changing his mind?

173
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,163
If you believe only one thing, Saber,
believe this.

174
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,960
For Kiritsugu and me to make
our ideal world a reality,

175
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,711
...you are absolutely essential.

176
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,607
It does a man good to
watch you drink...

177
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,818
Oh, thank you.

178
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:24,114
You should have told us
you had a guest!

179
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,116
No, no.
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

180
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:30,245
The simple pleasures of home
are what is best.

181
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,039
Oh, you're such a flatterer!

182
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,298
We couldn't help but worry over how
Waver was doing in school in England,

183
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,968
...but if he's made friends with
a strapping man like you,

184
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,470
...well, we were worried
over nothing!

185
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,516
Not at all, it is I
who am in his debt.

186
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:57,856
See? He even picked out
these fine pants for me.

187
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,860
So, how long will you
be in Japan, Alexei?

188
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:06,364
Oh, I should have my work here
wrapped up in a week or so.

189
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,869
If you like, why don't you
stay here with us?

190
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:15,540
I'm sure that there's enough space
for another futon in Waver's room.

191
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,250
Right, Waver?

192
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,296
Futon? Oh, the bedding
they sleep on in this land!

193
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,176
It takes some getting used to.

194
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,346
It's strange to sleep on the floor
instead of in a bed.

195
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,933
That is what is best
about foreign lands!

196
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,436
My favorite thing in life
is the surprise of the unknown!

197
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,814
Surely, Asia gives me the
most enjoyment in any age!

198
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,067
RiQht you are!

199
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:50,575
I told you... to take spiritual form...

200
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,077
...when you come and go!

201
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:56,081
Had I done so, I could not
have retrieved this.

202
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,167
I even managed to procure
this fine pair of pants.

203
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,546
Anyway, boy, it was you
who ordered me to do it.

204
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,843
Why must I,
the King of Conquerors,

205
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,806
...go forth to draw water from
some country river?

206
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:17,227
Because it's more productive than
eating junk food and watching videos.

207
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,903
What's this? Are you playing
at being an alchemist?

208
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,657
I'm not playing.
I am an alchemist.

209
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,662
What is that?

210
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,580
The residue left by spell casting.

211
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,083
It's the remnant of magic,
left in the water.

212
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,338
And that means someone was
using magic near the river.

213
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:50,176
If we follow the trail,
it may show us where to look.

214
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:56,266
Boy, did you know ahead of time that
something like that was in the water?

215
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,600
Of course not.

216
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,229
But this town is unusual, in that
water flows straight through its center.

217
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,482
So starting with the water was
the obvious choice.

218
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:16,286
Rider. Was there anything
between here and here?

219
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,040
Maybe an irrigation channel
or a sewage pipe?

220
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,251
Oh! There was
one of considerable size.

221
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,794
That's it.

222
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,965
If we follow it, it will probably
lead us to Caster's laboratory.

223
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:35,305
Boy, are you certain you aren't
a mage of not inconsiderable skill?

224
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,933
A skilled mage wouldn't
have to do it this way.

225
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,686
It's probably the simplest
imaginable method.

226
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,773
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

227
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,941
Not in the least!

228
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,569
To accomplish something impressive
using a simple method...

229
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,990
...far outshines achieving the same result
with a more complex technique!

230
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,951
As your Servant, I am proud.

231
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,703
Right, then...

232
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,372
Once we have his location,
he's as good as ours.

233
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,918
Shall we go give him
a good beating right away, boy?

234
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,173
Just wait a second. We're talking
about engaging Caster here.

235
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,550
- I know that.
- You don't know!

236
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:17,806
When it comes to defending his lair,
he has the largest advantage.

237
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,518
What kind of moron
would go bursting in?

238
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,812
Listen...

239
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:28,817
In combat, enemy and ally positions
can change by the second.

240
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,737
If you fail to attack the enemy
when you know his location,

241
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,074
...it will be too late for regrets
once you've missed your chance.

242
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,327
What's made you so eager today?

243
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,954
Why should I not be?

244
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:45,333
My Master has finally contributed
something of worth.

245
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,671
As a Servant,
I must also do my duty,

246
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,882
...and bring back the enemy's head!

247
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,595
Do not be so quick to give up
before we've even begun.

248
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,849
Let us go and see what we find.

249
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,060
It may well work out better
than you imagine.

250
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,150
I was right!

251
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,110
You see?
Everything has worked out!

252
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,495
Unfortunately,
Caster appears to be away.

253
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,251
Is this some kind of water storage system?

254
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,670
Hey, boy...

255
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,256
I think it would be best
if you didn't see this.

256
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,924
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,342
If Caster isn't here,

258
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:40,138
...we should at least search for clues
to his whereabouts.

259
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,933
That's as may be, but don't do it.

260
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,769
Boy, this is too much for you.

261
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,104
Shut up.

262
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,055
I warned you, didn't I?

263
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,140
I told you not to look.

264
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,225
Shut up!

265
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,728
Damn it, stop making fun of me.

266
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,313
Damn it...

267
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,067
This is no time for pride, fool.

268
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,985
Your reaction is perfectly natural.

269
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,990
If I saw someone who could
look on this and remain unmoved,

270
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,909
...I'd punch them.

271
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,871
What do you mean,
you'd punch them, you idiot?

272
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:52,669
Right now, you look just fine!

273
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,632
That's because now is not
the time for emotion.

274
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,101
Because my Master is in mortal peril!

275
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,146
Assassin?
But that's impossible!

276
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,858
Assassin's dead.

277
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,737
We can't afford to be surprised, boy.

278
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,880
H-How?

279
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,801
The "how" of it is irrelevant to us now.

280
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,637
However, one thing is certain...

281
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:50,435
Anyone who believed in
Assassin's demise has been deceived.

282
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,443
They ran... Didn't they?

283
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,445
Do not let your guard down.

284
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,573
We killed two, and there appeared
to be an additional two.

285
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,245
At this rate, who can say
how many Assassins there truly are.

286
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,540
This is their preferred terrain.

287
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,834
We should withdraw at once.

288
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,963
Should we really leave
this place the way it is?

289
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,009
Perhaps you'd find something
if you were to look, but let it go.

290
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,805
For now, we'll just have to
break what we can.

291
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:32,101
If nothing else,
it will serve to slow Caster down.

292
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:04,300
With his hideout in ruins, Caster will
no longer be able to run and hide.

293
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,304
He'll be forced to come out into the open.

294
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,474
Before too long,

295
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,976
...we shall put an end to them.

296
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,314
All right, I get it!

297
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,899
Quit doing that!

298
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,570
Let us be off, boy.

299
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,496
Do not let it trouble you, Kirei.

300
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,583
Indeed, it is unfortunate that
Assassin was exposed to them...

301
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,878
...before we could discern
the nature of Rider's ultimate weapon.

302
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,964
But from this,

303
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,384
...we've found out that Rider's Master
is a mere third-rate mage.

304
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:50,179
Had they not been discovered...

305
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,015
Other options would have
become available to you?

306
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,350
Yes.

307
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,271
While your plans are
certainly important,

308
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,399
...you must remain refined
and relaxed, in all matters.

309
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,612
Dignity is required, even in battle.

310
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,575
<i>But I never thought
he'd be so boring a person...</i>

311
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,873
We will have another chance to
see Rider's ultimate attack.

312
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,545
Have Assassin continue to monitor Rider,
but to take great care as they do.

313
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,424
Understood, my teacher.

314
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,761
Episode 9:
Master and Servant

315
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:39,020
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

316
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:47,820
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

317
00:24:55,411 --> 00:25:02,835
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

318
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,093
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

319
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:20,186
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

320
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:26,526
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

321
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:35,201
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

322
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:42,124
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

323
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:50,216
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

324
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:58,641
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

325
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,688
I used too much mana at once?

326
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,315
I'm certain there's something
I can do to help!

327
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,150
Surely she didn't go to Fuyuki...

328
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,444
Behold the family magic of the Matous.

329
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,322
We're just about to get
the party started.

330
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:13,823
I can't accomplish
anything like this!

331
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,783
Next Time: Rin's Big Adventure I
can't accomplish anything like this!
