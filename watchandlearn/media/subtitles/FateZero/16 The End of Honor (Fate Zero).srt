1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,464
My apologies for the wait.

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:09,385
Things have been rather
hectic this evening.

3
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:15,349
It couldn't be helped,
given the situation.

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,394
It will be difficult to
cover all that up.

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,062
Yes, perhaps...

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,067
This is far too much for
the Church to handle by herself.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,447
We are accepting any aid
proffered for this effort.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,742
Now then, Father...

9
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:38,080
Regarding my request,
what is your decision?

10
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:43,085
Regarding the reward offered
for the defeat of Caster...

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,113
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou 
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

12
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:17,078
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

13
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:23,375
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

14
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:28,339
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

15
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:36,180
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

16
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,475
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

17
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:45,689
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

18
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:50,778
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

19
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,197
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

20
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:58,077
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,247
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,624
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

23
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:10,381
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

24
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,347
Thank goodness...

25
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,184
Now, once I get the Command
Seal for killing Caster,

26
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:26,397
...Diarmuid and I will be truly connected.

27
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,869
My right hand... It's gone!

28
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,080
My right hand! My right hand!

29
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,750
I need it! Or I cannot
call Diarmuid!

30
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,378
I won't be able to make
him care for me!

31
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,629
My right hand...

32
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,883
My right hand. My right hand.
My right hand! My right hand!

33
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,302
Hand...

34
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:59,221
My hand...

35
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,229
I have secured Sola-Ui Nuada-Re
Sophia-Ri over in New Town.

36
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,858
I removed the Command Seals
along with her right hand.

37
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,109
Fine.

38
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,403
Get out of there immediately.

39
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,239
Lancer should return any time now.

40
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,407
Roger.

41
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,297
<i>I saved Kariya Matou...</i>

42
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,550
<i>Without doubt, he could
threaten my Master.</i>

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,845
<i>There is no excuse.
This is an act of rebellion.</i>

44
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,599
<i>But what is this I am feeling?</i>

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,478
<i>It is not regret...</i>

46
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,149
Could I be excited?

47
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,654
It's true that in
the defeat of Caster,

48
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:01,367
...the Servant Lancer played
an important part,

49
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,287
...as verified by observer reports.

50
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,668
Then I have the right to receive
one of the Command Seals?

51
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,045
About that...

52
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,131
Mr. Kayneth Archibald,

53
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,553
...I am unsure whether it is appropriate
to consider you a Master at this point.

54
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,431
My pact with Lancer
was executed jointly...

55
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:29,144
...by my fiancée, Sola-Ui, and me.

56
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,482
And is Sola-Ui not the one
currently supplying mana...

57
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,486
...and acting as caretaker
for the Command Seals?

58
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,696
That is true.

59
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,824
I have temporarily given
her the Command Seals.

60
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:46,954
However, the rights of the
pact still reside with me.

61
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,247
First off,

62
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,959
...the petition submitted to the
Church to be a Master...

63
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,045
...was filed in my name.

64
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,174
Very well.

65
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,011
The rights are yours.

66
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,346
Now, Mr. Kayneth...

67
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,348
Extend your hand.

68
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,270
Take this, and drink from it.

69
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:16,900
This is my blood, which will be
poured out for you and for many.

70
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,819
The blood of the covenant!

71
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,417
I hope you will continue to fight
a noble battle as a Master.

72
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,337
Yes, of course.

73
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,643
<i>I'm down to a single
Command Seal.</i>

74
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,396
<i>My situation remains dire.</i>

75
00:05:54,772 --> 00:06:01,862
<i>I cannot allow the other Masters an additional seal!</i>

76
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,450
Mistress Sola-Ui!

77
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,787
You complete incompetent!

78
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,955
Useless, bumbling fool!

79
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,292
You fail to protect even
a single woman?

80
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,671
I'm sick of all your talk of chivalry...

81
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,757
I am grievously sorry.

82
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,260
She may have been a mere substitute,

83
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:29,014
...but you still failed to protect
even your own Master!

84
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,059
What are you good for
as a Servant?

85
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,521
I'm amazed you had the nerve
to return here alone.

86
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,856
I am afraid, my Master,

87
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,444
...that Sola-Ui and I never
entered into a proper pact.

88
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,031
We could not sense
each other's presence.

89
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,285
And so you should have
taken special care!

90
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,703
My Master,

91
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,998
...Mistress Sola-Ui lives yet.

92
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,876
She still supplies me with mana.

93
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,378
Irrelevant!

94
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,173
If you are not properly
her Servant...

95
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,427
...and cannot discern her location,
it doesn't matter!

96
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,640
Sola-Ui, I should never have given
you those Command Seals...

97
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,226
I could not dissuade her.

98
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,478
I share in the responsibility.

99
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,067
I can't believe you have
the nerve to say that.

100
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,194
Don't try fooling me, Lancer.

101
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,906
You were the one who
encouraged Sola-Ui.

102
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,826
Never, Master!

103
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,328
It's just as in the legend...

104
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,330
Are you truly incapable of seeing...

105
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,292
...your lord's fiancée without
attempting to seduce her?

106
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,753
My Master,

107
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,048
...please retract those words.

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,010
Oh, have I struck a nerve?

109
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,681
You're only a beast.
You swore eternal loyalty,

110
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,185
...and then gave in to lust!

111
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,519
Kayneth...

112
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,188
why...

113
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,398
Why will you not understand?

114
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,442
I...

115
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,069
I wished only to defend my honor.

116
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,157
To fight in noble battle with you.

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,203
Don't speak to me like that,
Servant!

118
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,246
Understand your place.

119
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,459
You're nothing but a ghost,
granted form by magic!

120
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,212
You dare to lecture your Master?

121
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,714
Absurd!

122
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,094
If you are so dissatisfied,
use your precious pride...

123
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,097
...to resist my Command Seal.

124
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,725
You'll never win.

125
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,229
You Servants are mere puppets,
and here is your string.

126
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,814
Kayneth...

127
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,568
Master...

128
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,614
What? You still have something
to say to me?

129
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,283
No, that isn't it.

130
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,662
Something is approaching.

131
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,835
It's just as Kiritsugu said.

132
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,588
There are traces of
a magical barrier.

133
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,257
But it's strange...

134
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,592
It hasn't been properly maintained.

135
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,511
It's already starting to...

136
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,137
...fall apart...

137
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,601
I did not expect you here, Saber.

138
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,603
My...

139
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,440
My ally found this place
and informed me.

140
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,151
They said this was your location.

141
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,614
You would not happen to know
where my Master's betrothed is,

142
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,201
...would you, Saber?

143
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,038
I do not.

144
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,748
What of it?

145
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,084
No. Forget it.

146
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,837
In any event, are you certain
about this, Saber?

147
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,924
You did not come to engage
in idle chit-chat, I'm sure.

148
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,386
After employing that technique
against Caster,

149
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,722
...you must be exhausted.

150
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,850
No more so than the other Servants.

151
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,520
None will be fighting
further tonight.

152
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,314
They will focus on defense.

153
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,818
That is why we needn't worry
about being interrupted.

154
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,617
Dawn nears,

155
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,913
...but I believe this may be the best night
to finish our battle.

156
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,166
What say you, Lancer?

157
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,294
Saber...

158
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,797
The only thing that still
grants my heart peace...

159
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,760
...is your pure fighting spirit.

160
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,415
<i>Her attacks are too weak.</i>

161
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,089
Saber, you...

162
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,383
You will not use your left hand?

163
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,053
Don't get the wrong idea, Lancer.

164
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,722
If I use my left hand here,

165
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,475
...the shame is certain
to dull my blade.

166
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:29,106
Against your spear,
that would be fatal.

167
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,732
Saber...

168
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,901
Therefore, Diarmuid,

169
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,240
...this is my best strategy...

170
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,576
...to defeat you.

171
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,749
Pride rests in the blade of chivalry!

172
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,334
I...

173
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,963
I am glad that I was given the
opportunity to meet you.

174
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,386
I am first spear of the
knights of Fianna,

175
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,846
...Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

176
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:01,972
Here I go!

177
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,557
Splendid!

178
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,352
I, Arturia Pendragon, King of Britain,
accept your challenge.

179
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,313
Come, then!

180
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,859
Why does he not win?

181
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,445
If he has no certain
path to victory,

182
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,573
...should he not escape
with his Master?

183
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,785
Right now, our highest
priority is to rescue Sola-Ui...

184
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,830
Why can he not
understand even that?

185
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,623
That useless Servant!

186
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,311
<i>Why him, of all people?</i>

187
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,531
<i>This is...</i>

188
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,743
<i>...a Self-Geas Scroll.</i>

189
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:13,210
<i>A magical item, used by mages
to forge an unbreakable pact.</i>

190
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,170
<i>Binding Spell...</i>

191
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,006
<i>Affected Party: Kiritsugu Emiya.</i>

192
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,342
<i>The Crest of the Emiya family
orders the following.</i>

193
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:28,016
<i>The pledge is to be obeyed by the Affected Party
upon fulfillment of the terms described herein.</i>

194
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,518
<i>Pledge:</i>

195
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,980
<i>That Kiritsugu, son of Norikata,
fifth heir to the house of Emiya,</i>

196
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,609
<i>...will be forever forbidden
from harming...</i>

197
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,948
<i>...Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald and
Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri...</i>

198
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,868
<i>...or intending them to come to harm.</i>

199
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,578
<i>Terms...</i>

200
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:55,544
<i>In principle, the curse of the Geas
cannot be removed by any means.</i>

201
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:00,173
<i>Even if you forfeit your life,
as long as the Magic Crest exists,</i>

202
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,635
...it <i>will bind your soul,
even in death.</i>

203
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,807
<i>It's true that if I do what's written,
he cannot kill me.</i>

204
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,728
<i>But under these terms, my fight...</i>

205
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,399
<i>...will end here.</i>

206
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,569
<i>The Grail...</i>

207
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,446
<i>And the Archibald family pride...</i>

208
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,242
<i>He asks me to throw it all away?</i>

209
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,431
<i>Sola-Ui...</i>

210
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,163
Use all your remaining Command Seals
to compel your Servant to commit suicide.

211
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,293
The terms have been met.

212
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,344
You want to win...

213
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,138
You want to win so desperately?

214
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,974
You desire the Grail
so desperately?

215
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,309
You have crushed...

216
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,729
You have crushed my sole
remaining wish...

217
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,397
And you...

218
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,317
You feel no shame at all?!

219
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,902
I will never forgive you.

220
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,237
I will never forgive you for this!

221
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,867
You inhuman monsters who have
ruined the honor of a knight,

222
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,162
...let my blood taint your dreams!

223
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,790
May the Grail be cursed!

224
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,501
May the wish it grants
bring disaster!

225
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,796
And when you fall into the pits of hell,

226
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,008
...remember the rage of Diarmuid!

227
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,767
Now the Geas binds you?

228
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,061
Yes, the pact has been sealed.

229
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,772
I can no longer kill you.

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,712
I can't, anyway-

231
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,680
Kill me...

232
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,057
Kill me, please...

233
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,434
Sorry.

234
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,061
Our pact forbids me from harming you.

235
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,283
Kiritsugu Emiya...

236
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,287
I finally understand what
a terrible man you are.

237
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,041
I believed that our paths differed,
but we shared a mutual goal.

238
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,418
I was a fool to think this.

239
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,758
Until now,
I placed my faith in Irisviel's words,

240
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,260
...and thus did not doubt you.

241
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:38,850
But now, I can no longer believe that
your desire for the Grail...

242
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,978
...has anything to do with salvation.

243
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,272
Answer me, Kiritsugu!

244
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,108
What is the true reason
you desire the Grail?

245
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,196
Even should my sword win the Grail,

246
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,451
...if that means I must
yield it to you, I...

247
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,286
Answer her, Kiritsugu.

248
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,582
After all this, you owe her
an explanation.

249
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,835
Come to think of it,

250
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:11,382
...this is the first time I have shown you
the way I kill, Iri.

251
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,511
If you only eliminate a Master,

252
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,806
...the Servant may enter into
a pact with another party.

253
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:22,310
So I had to eliminate the Master
and Servant simultaneously.

254
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,481
Kiritsugu,
speak to Saber, not me.

255
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,943
She needs to hear your words.

256
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:30,985
No.

257
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,737
Honor, glory...

258
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,282
There's no point in
speaking to a killer...

259
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,785
...who extols the virtues
of such things.

260
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,704
You would even insult chivalry
to my face, monster?!

261
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,166
A knight cannot save the world.

262
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,130
Knights call certain methods of
fighting good and others evil,

263
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:54,092
...acting as if there were some
nobility to the battlefield.

264
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,096
Such illusions, created by
heroes throughout history,

265
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,348
...have led countless young men...

266
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:05,728
...to their bloody deaths, all for the sake
of this glory and honor.

267
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,355
They are not illusions!

268
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,607
Even the taking of life,

269
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,528
...as a human act,
must have laws and ideals.

270
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,241
Otherwise, every war would
bring hell to this world!

271
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,368
And there you go.

272
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,453
You heard her, Iri.

273
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:28,042
Our Heroic Spirit considers a battlefield
to be something better than hell.

274
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,669
What a joke.

275
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,547
It's hell itself.

276
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,425
There's no hope to be had on a battlefield.

277
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,720
There is nothing but
unspeakable despair.

278
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,142
Just a crime we call victory,
paid for by the pain of the defeated.

279
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,687
But humanity has never
recognized this truth.

280
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,732
And the reason is that,
in every era,

281
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,568
...dazzling heroes have blinded the
people with their legends,

282
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,238
...and kept them from seeing
the evil of bloodshed.

283
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:02,702
True human nature has not advanced
a step beyond the Stone Age.

284
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,413
Then, Kiritsugu...

285
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,458
Is the reason you force Saber
to endure such humiliation...

286
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,336
...because of your hatred
for the Heroic Spirits?

287
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,462
Of course not.

288
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,923
Such personal feelings
don't enter into it.

289
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,092
I will win the Holy Grail
and save the world.

290
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:23,598
And I will wage that war with the
most appropriate weapons at my disposal.

291
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,559
Justice and righteousness
cannot save the world.

292
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,729
I care nothing for such things.

293
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,941
Kiritsugu...
Do you fully understand?

294
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,443
If you do evil
out of hatred for evil,

295
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,781
...that rage and hatred will
merely give rise to new conflict.

296
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,116
Kiritsugu Emiya,

297
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,535
...I do not know what betrayed you,

298
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,704
...or what has caused you
to lose all hope.

299
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,582
But your rage and sorrow...

300
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,461
...are found only in those who
once sought justice.

301
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:59,968
Kiritsugu, in youth, your truest self wished
to be a hero, did it not?

302
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,012
A hero to save the world.

303
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,266
You believed in that...
You desired it more than anyone.

304
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,642
Or am I wrong?

305
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,189
I will break this endless cycle.

306
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,733
The Grail will make that possible.

307
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,820
I'll ensure that the blood
I spill in Fuyuki...

308
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,322
...is the last blood that
humanity will ever shed.

309
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:27,161
If that means I must stain my hands
with every evil in the world, I don't care.

310
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,874
If that will save the world, I do it gladly.

311
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,845
Kiritsugu has left, hasn't he?

312
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,805
Irisviel?

313
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,103
Irisviel!

314
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,024
Episode 16:
The End of Honor

315
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:01,821
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

316
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,868
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

317
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:15,918
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

318
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:23,051
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

319
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:30,933

Contract Goodbye, Father.
