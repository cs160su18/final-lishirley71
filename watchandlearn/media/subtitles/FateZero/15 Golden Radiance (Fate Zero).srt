1
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,811
What do we do, Rider?

2
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,958
What now, mad dog?

3
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,427
Tokiomi...

4
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,101
I'll kill you!

5
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,952
Saber!

6
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,089
This isn't going in our favor.

7
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,136
<i>If only Saber could use
her left hand...</i>

8
00:01:55,908 --> 00:02:02,081
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

9
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:08,045
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

10
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,343
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,306
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

12
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:27,148
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

13
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,442
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

14
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:36,615
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

15
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,829
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

16
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,123
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

17
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:49,044
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

18
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,214
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

19
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,592
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

20
00:02:54,675 --> 00:03:01,348
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

21
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,229
Hey, Saber!

22
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,231
We're not getting anywhere
like this!

23
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,316
Withdraw for now!

24
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,403
Don't be stupid!
We must stop him here!

25
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,574
But we've exhausted our options.
Fall back for now.

26
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,492
I have an idea.

27
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,584
Listen, all.

28
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,545
Regardless of our plan,

29
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,672
...we must first gain time.

30
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,968
I shall draw him into
the Ionian Hetairoi.

31
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,971
However, not even the might of all
my elite warriors combined...

32
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,974
...will be able to slay that.

33
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,853
At best, all we can do is stall him
within the Reality Marble.

34
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,231
What then?

35
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,690
No idea.

36
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,691
Huh?

37
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,945
If I take in a thing of
that magnitude,

38
00:03:56,028 --> 00:04:00,199
...the Reality Marble will only
last a few minutes.

39
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,701
Within that time,
you must find a way.

40
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,245
Heroic Spirits,

41
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:08,082
...I want you to find a
path to victory.

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,085
Hey, kid...

43
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,045
You stay here, too.

44
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,299
Hey!

45
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:22,721
Once I deploy the bounded field,
I won't know what transpires outside.

46
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:27,226
Kid, should something happen,
focus your mind and call me.

47
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,978
I shall dispatch a messenger.

48
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,151
Saber! Lancer!

49
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,569
I leave the rest to you.

50
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,322
Very well.

51
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,848
Such a futile effort.

52
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,695
Mom!

53
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,371
What is that?

54
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,331
You may as well dive headlong
into that mass of filth,

55
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,290
...mongrel.

56
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,368
After all that raging and
ranting against me,

57
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,455
...but when it comes time to follow through,
this is all you have?

58
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,130
Is he trying to
destroy himself?

59
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,467
Kariya. Consider this
an act of mercy.

60
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,470
<i>Intensive Einascherung.</i>

61
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,817
I-I'll kill you...

62
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,486
Tokiomi!

63
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,906
Zouken...

64
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,504
What should we do?

65
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,340
I know he said he'd
buy us some time,

66
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:50,304
...but if we don't think of something,
we'll be right back where we started.

67
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,057
Hey, Einzbern...
Don't you have any ideas?

68
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,518
Well, do you?

69
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,191
Well, um...

70
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,526
How does this work?

71
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,571
Iri?

72
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,449
Um, no, I'm...
Wait, who is--

73
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,659
I understand.

74
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:17,539
You are Rider's Master?
Perfect. I wanted to talk to you, too.

75
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,541
Who are you?

76
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,210
That doesn't matter.

77
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:25,464
Caster's disappearance
was your Servant's work, yes?

78
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,549
That's right... I guess.

79
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,134
A question, then.

80
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:34,973
When Rider releases his Reality Marble,
can he put down the contents in a specific area?

81
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,727
To a degree.

82
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,480
Within a hundred meters or so.

83
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,731
It should be possible.

84
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,486
Rider's the one who has control over where
he exits into the outside world.

85
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,695
Very well.

86
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,741
I'll wait for the right moment,
then fire a signal flare.

87
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,620
Send Caster back directly under it.
Can you do that?

88
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,747
I can... I think.

89
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,873
Probably.

90
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,416
One more thing.

91
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,502
I need you to relay a
message to Lancer.

92
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,506
Tell him that Saber's left hand has an
anti-fortress Noble Phantasm.

93
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,049
Huh?

94
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,595
Is something wrong?

95
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,848
Well, there was a
message for you.

96
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,102
Something about Saber's left hand being
an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm...

97
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,108
Is that true, Saber?

98
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:34,199
Can it destroy Caster's monster
with a single strike?

99
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,410
It can.

100
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,288
However, Lancer...

101
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,249
The weight of my sword is
the weight of my pride.

102
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,378
The wound from my battle with you
is an honor, not a hindrance.

103
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,300
In exchange for my left hand,
I gained Diarmuid Ua Duibhne's aid.

104
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,135
That is worth ten thousand men.

105
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,475
Now, Saber...

106
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,769
I cannot forgive Caster's actions.

107
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,858
He looks favorably upon the despair of the
masses and takes joy in spreading terror.

108
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,819
By the vows I swore as a knight,

109
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,363
...I cannot abide such evil.

110
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,534
Lancer, you mustn't!

111
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,122
Is it Saber who must win this fight?
Is it Lancer?

112
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,541
No, it is neither.

113
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,879
What must triumph here is the
knight's path of chivalry.

114
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,798
Am I wrong,
Heroic Spirit Arturia?

115
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,688
Lancer...

116
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:51,068
I shall rest my hope of victory
upon your blade, King of Knights.

117
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,029
I shall place my faith in you, Saber.

118
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,368
I accept, Lancer.

119
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,704
And upon my sword,
I swear victory!

120
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,969
That's...

121
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,846
From King Arthur's legend...

122
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,271
Saber!

123
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,981
Berserker?

124
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:30,857
He's...

125
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,758
You dare turn your
back on me, mongrel?

126
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,051
What insolence!

127
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,429
What?

128
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,064
Saber!

129
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,191
What does Berserker think he's doing?

130
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,445
<i>I regain use of my left
hand, and now this?</i>

131
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,304
<i>Regardless of its own
self-awareness of this fact,</i>

132
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,848
<i>...a soul instinctively
seeks out the superior.</i>

133
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:50,812
<i>He was the only one you ordered Assassin
to investigate to such a degree...</i>

134
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,523
<i>...that you could understand those
complicated circumstances.</i>

135
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,902
<i>And this was due to your
unconscious interest.</i>

136
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,531
It's still too soon.

137
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,617
What was that tremor?

138
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,872
A sign that Rider's Reality Marble
approaches its limit.

139
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,500
Rider...

140
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,007
I am Mithrenes of the Hetairoi.

141
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,136
I have come as my king's ears.

142
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,058
I want you to tell him
to wait for our signal,

143
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,312
...and then release the bounded field and
dump out Caster at the designated location.

144
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,689
He can do it, right?

145
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,399
It is possible.

146
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,193
But we're nearly out of time.

147
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,572
Within the Reality Marble,

148
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,325
...our forces cannot restrain that
strange monster much longer.

149
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,743
I know!

150
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,412
I know that!

151
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,334
Damn it!
That stupid Berserker.

152
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,420
Can't we do anything about him?

153
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,713
I will go.

154
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,715
Lancer...

155
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,472
I am putting an end to this,
mad warrior!

156
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,116
<i>It's all or nothing...</i>

157
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,963
Archer...

158
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,068
There! Right under that!

159
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,277
As you wish.

160
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,505
Really...

161
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,590
What took so long?

162
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,403
Now, Saber, show me.

163
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:31,199
I shall judge the true worth of
your Heroic Spirit's radiance.

164
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,140
The light...

165
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,766
It shines.

166
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:03,231
That sword is the embodiment of the sad,
yet noble, dream of all soldiers,

167
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:08,987
...past, present, and future, who lie
dying on the field of battle,

168
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,406
...clutched to their hearts
with their last breath.

169
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,367
She carries their will
as her pride,

170
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,162
...bidding them to remain
steadfast in their loyalty.

171
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,999
Now, the undefeated king
sings aloud...

172
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,668
...the name of the miracle
she holds in her hand.

173
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,886
Its name is...

174
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:38,808
<i>Excalibur!</i>

175
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,330
This light...

176
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,554
That's it, without doubt.

177
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,139
This light is...

178
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,477
This was the light, the blessing
of bliss with Jeanne...

179
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,657
What have...

180
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,118
I...

181
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,398
Did you see that,
King of Conquerors?

182
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,567
That was Saber's radiance.

183
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,945
Even after such a sight,

184
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,406
...do you still refuse to accept her worth?

185
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:23,204
That light comes from her having taken
all her people's hopes upon herself.

186
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,207
Its brightness is
painful to look upon.

187
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,377
And when you consider that
the one who must bear that burden...

188
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,297
...is but a dreaming little girl...

189
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,302
What I see there is what became
of a girl who was never allowed...

190
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,554
...to admire butterflies or flowers,
or even to fall in love,

191
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,558
...but was cursed by her ideals,
and ended up this way.

192
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,936
It is too painful to gaze upon.

193
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,648
Is that not why she
is so beautiful?

194
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,985
Her dreams were too much for her.

195
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:58,156
I imagine that, in the end,
they destroyed the dreamer.

196
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,993
The tears of lamentation she
surely shed as she died...

197
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,455
How sweet they must have tasted.

198
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,336
Truly, you and I will never get along,
Babylonian King of Heroes.

199
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,006
Oh? You finally realized that?

200
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,550
Then what will you do, Rider?

201
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,930
Will you let your steel give
shape to your rage?

202
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,183
I'd very much like that...

203
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:31,231
But I have exerted myself a bit much
to face such a one as you this night.

204
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:36,486
Of course, should you refuse to
allow me passage,

205
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,947
...I would be forced to fight back.

206
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,907
I don't mind.

207
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,201
I shall allow your retreat,
King of Conquerors.

208
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,287
I shouldn't like to destroy
you at anything less...

209
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,872
...than your full strength.

210
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,751
I suppose that you yourself...

211
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,380
...haven't yet healed from the damage
that black thing inflicted?

212
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,676
I repay provocation with death.

213
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,929
We can decide this next time,
King of Heroes.

214
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,724
And our battle will be
the one that determines...

215
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,060
...the winner of this Grail War.

216
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,817
I wouldn't be so certain.

217
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:20,196
I have yet to decide whether
only one is worthy to face...

218
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,824
...my ultimate treasure, Rider.

219
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:29,247
Fool who reaches for dreams
beyond what humans may attain...

220
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,501
Only one in all creation should be
allowed to love her in her destruction.

221
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,838
And that is I, Gilgamesh.

222
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:45,847
Ephemeral and brilliant one,
fall to my embrace.

223
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,350
Such is my decision.

224
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,940
Episode 15:
Golden Shine

225
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,738
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

226
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:06,784
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

227
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:15,835
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

228
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:22,967
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

229
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:30,850
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

230
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:35,772
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

231
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:41,694
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

232
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:46,699
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

233
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:51,746
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

234
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:56,667
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

235
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:04,258
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

236
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,761
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

237
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:11,766
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

238
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:18,272
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

239
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:24,278
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

240
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,826
I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne,
first spear of the knights of Fianna!

241
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,371
I am glad that I had the
opportunity to meet you.

242
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,622
Indeed!

243
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,376
I, Arturia Pendragon, King of Britain,
accept your challenge.

244
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,419
Next Time: The End
of Honor Come, then!

245
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,962
Next Time: The End
of Honor Here I go!
