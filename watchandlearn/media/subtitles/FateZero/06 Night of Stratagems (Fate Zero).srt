1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,641
See? See?
It goes really fast!

2
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,936
Y-You're a surprisingly good driver.

3
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:24,650
I know, right?! You may not believe it,
but I practice all the time.

4
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,948
Of all the toys Kiritsugu has
brought me, this is my favorite!

5
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,908
TOYS?

6
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:42,084
At the castle, I could only drive around
the courtyard, so this is great!

7
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,881
Shouldn't we have hired
a professional driver?

8
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,841
No, that would be boring!

9
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,843
I mean, dangerous!

10
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,512
What if the enemy attacks us?

11
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,848
That's true.

12
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:56,682
Stop!

13
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,774
Irisviel...

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,778
Get out of the car and
stay close to me.

15
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:09,945
This presence...

16
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,614
That's a Servant.

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,176
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

18
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:38,307
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

19
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:44,688
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

20
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:51,403
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

21
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:57,576
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

22
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:05,292
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

23
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,546
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

24
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,590
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

25
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:17,513
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

26
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:23,185
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

27
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,939
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

28
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:33,696
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

29
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:39,785
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

30
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,555
I've come for you, my holy virgin.

31
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,810
You know him?

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,562
I've never laid eyes on him.

33
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,480
Oh, “Q!

34
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,150
You say you have
forgotten this face?

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,195
Forgotten?
I've never met you in my life.

36
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,905
Perhaps you mistake me for another?

37
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,743
It's me! Gilles de Rais!

38
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,912
My one prayer has been
for your resurrection,

39
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,831
...and I've spent my life waiting
for a miracle to reunite us!

40
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:29,418
To that end, I've come all this way,
to the end of time!

41
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,419
Jeanne!

42
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,421
Jeanne?

43
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,381
I know not your name,

44
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,843
...nor have I any idea
who this Jeanne might be.

45
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,762
No...

46
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,431
You can't have forgotten...

47
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,183
Not your former identity!

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,353
As you've given me your name,

49
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,273
...in accordance with the chivalric code,
I must give you my own.

50
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,317
My name is Arturia.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,736
Heir to Uther Pendragon,

52
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,446
...and King of Britain.

53
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,616
I enter this battle in the Saber class.

54
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,118
How tragic!

55
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,787
How sad...

56
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,332
She's lost her memory
and gone mad!

57
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,793
Curse him...

58
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,336
Curse him!

59
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,298
Such cruel tortures God inflicts
upon my beautiful maiden!

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,342
Enough! You embarrass yourself!

61
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,344
Awaken...

62
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,806
Call yourself Saber no longer.

63
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,684
The Holy Grail War has ended.

64
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:31,897
The Grail has chosen me, Gilles,
with no fighting at all!

65
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,148
For you see,

66
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:38,362
...my only wish, the resurrection of
Jeanne d'Arc, has been granted!

67
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:53,043
If you further mock
all the other heroes' prayers,

68
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,170
...the next strike will be real.

69
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,547
Now rise!

70
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,093
Has your heart been sealed
so tightly, Jeanne?

71
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,178
Very well, then.

72
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:08,934
If drastic measures are called for,
I will have to prepare.

73
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,103
I swear to you, Jeanne...

74
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:16,608
I will free your soul
from God's curse.

75
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:27,411
It's difficult to deal with one
who ignores what you are saying.

76
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,372
Next time, I shall strike
before he can speak.

77
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,666
His type infuriates me.

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,629
However, this may have been
fortunate for me.

79
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:42,885
I sensed that he was too dangerous
to face without the use of my left hand.

80
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,145
Following Saber's Master
has yielded unexpected fruit.

81
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,731
We found Caster, as well.

82
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,692
Of course, we must follow him.

83
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,071
Ah... No, no.

84
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,323
Here is what you do with the thumb.

85
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,828
Nice...

86
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Perfect.

87
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,588
Welcome back, big guy.

88
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,261
Hey!

89
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,764
Accursed God!

90
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,726
He keeps an iron grip on Jeanne's soul,
refusing to let go!

91
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,313
By Jeanne, you mean your girl in the crystal ball?

92
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,567
We must prove it to her!

93
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,862
That God's power is gone...
That my love is wasted!

94
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:49,493
That no foul deed, no horrible crime,
is worthy of God's punishment!

95
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,495
Yeah, I get it.

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,789
You're even cooler!

97
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,207
Therefore!

98
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,585
We require greater depravities,
greater blasphemies.

99
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,005
We must erect a veritable Tower of Babel
of human sacrifices!

100
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:06,260
Uh, so basically...

101
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,512
From now on,
it's quantity over quality?

102
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,306
Indeed... Exactly so!

103
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,308
Impressive, Ryunosuke.

104
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:18,147
Our first step will be sacrificing
the eleven in their cells right away.

105
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,650
And then we'll go acquire
some more children.

106
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,406
Kind of a waste...

107
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:35,956
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you this breaking news.</i>

108
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:36,665
Unexplained Explosion

109
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,917
<i>Unexplained Explosion
An unexplained explosion has occurred...</i>

110
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,336
<i>Unexplained Explosion
...in the Fuyuki coastal district's warehouse area.</i>

111
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,171
Unexplained Explosion

112
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,381
<i>We go live to the scene...</i>

113
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,178
Why weren't you able to
finish Saber tonight?

114
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,096
Not just once but twice.

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,350
You made me waste a Command Seal,
yet you still couldn't finish the job.

116
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,939
Was your fight with Saber
that much fun?

117
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,649
That had nothing to do with it...

118
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,908
I swear on my honor as a knight,
I will bring you Saber's head.

119
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,285
You don't need to swear it
to me again!

120
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,828
Of course you will!

121
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,207
You made a pact with me
for the Grail!

122
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:23,212
And now, you swear to defeat Saber?

123
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,047
What about this do you
not understand?!

124
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,385
Aren't you the one who's mistaken,
Lord El-Melloi?

125
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,722
Sola-Ui...

126
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,724
Lancer did well.

127
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,393
You were the one
who made the mistake.

128
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,064
Saber is a powerful Servant...

129
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,568
I couldn't allow a chance
to defeat her pass me by.

130
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,905
You inflicted a wound on her
that cannot heal.

131
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,200
By letting her go,
you can defeat her at your leisure.

132
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:59,248
If you're that concerned about her,
why didn't you go after her Master?

133
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,377
You merely stayed hidden
and watched. Pathetic.

134
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,382
Kayneth, it isn't that
you don't understand...

135
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:13,387
...your advantage over
the other Masters, right?

136
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:20,018
You made a special alteration to
the usual Master-Servant contract.

137
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:25,941
You get the Command Seals, and
I act as additional Master and supply mana.

138
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,862
You weren't the Evocation Division's
brightest star for nothing.

139
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,117
But we must take care at the start.

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,410
Must we, now?

141
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,246
So you'll hide, while you make
Lancer take all the risks...

142
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,206
That's enough.

143
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,544
Any more will be an insult
to my Master.

144
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,754
As a knight, I cannot allow it.

145
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,593
No, I didn't mean it like that...

146
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,512
I'm sorry. I've overstepped
my bounds.

147
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,441
What? What's going on?

148
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,368
Understood.

149
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,915
A fire on the lower levels.
It's arson, of course.

150
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,918
Arson? Tonight, of all nights?

151
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,629
They wish to empty the place.

152
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,173
Then it's an attack?

153
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:39,181
Saber's Master will want to lift
the Spear's curse as soon as possible.

154
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,601
Lancer, go downstairs and defeat her.

155
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,728
Don't just drive her off this time.

156
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,937
Understood.

157
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:51,943
Let's have our guest enjoy the magical
workshop of Kayneth El-Melloi.

158
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,906
A perfect workshop,
requiring an entire floor.

159
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,241
Twenty-four layered barriers.

160
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,785
Three mana generators.

161
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,246
Dozens of ghosts and evil spirits,
roaming as guard dogs.

162
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,623
Thousands of traps.

163
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,959
Parts of hallways that open
onto other worlds.

164
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,634
We shall both be able to avail ourselves
of all our magical techniques.

165
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,223
I will make you retract your statement
that I'm pathetic shortly.

166
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,475
I look forward to that.

167
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,401
Lord Archibald!

168
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,779
Lord Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald!

169
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,280
Are you present?

170
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,115
Yes.

171
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,618
That's me.
Don't worry.

172
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:49,084
Both Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald and
his wife, Sola-Ui, have evacuated.

173
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,464
I see.

174
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,133
Yes, that's fine.

175
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,761
Everyone has evacuated.

176
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,679
Excellent.

177
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,975
Everything is ready on my end.
And you?

178
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,602
All green.
Just give the word.

179
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:47,976
Maiya.

180
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,812
Target never even moved.

181
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,856
He didn't leave the hotel.

182
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,026
A free-fall from 150 meters...

183
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:01,573
No magical barrier could have
saved him from that.

184
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,002
Maiya, withdraw.

185
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:27,974
To blow up the entire building...
I can't believe a mage would do that.

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,022
Rather, I suppose you are a master
at outsmarting mages.

187
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,733
Kirei Kotomine...

188
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,320
I don't believe we've met.

189
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,533
Or do you have a reason that
you'd know me already?

190
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,494
In that case, I can guess
who you are.

191
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,623
Don't make me do
all the talking, woman.

192
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,875
One word will suffice.

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,004
Where is the man who should
have been here instead of you?

194
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,641
Not bad.

195
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,185
You seem to have training.

196
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,420
She didn't throw this.

197
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,265
Very well...

198
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,518
Just the knowledge that
someone was here to save her...

199
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,062
...means that tonight
was not a total waste.

200
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,316
Master Kirei.

201
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,612
I thought I told you
not to expose yourself.

202
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:09,451
My apologies, but there is something
you should hear.

203
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,870
We located Caster.

204
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,918
After having Assassin perform
a detailed investigation,

205
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,464
...we learned that Caster and
his Master have kidnapped children

206
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,300
from their beds, from Miyama
and the next town over.

207
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,928
By dawn, they had fifteen.

208
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,891
I would imagine that they
are the serial killer...

209
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,060
...that everyone is worked up over.

210
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,647
They use magic
without the slightest hesitation,

211
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,816
...doing nothing to hide their tracks.

212
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:47,906
It is quite possible that they are not
even thinking of the Holy Grail War.

213
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:53,244
A mad Servant, out of control,
and a Master who cannot control him.

214
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,082
Why is someone like that
participating in the Grail War?

215
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,418
We cannot ignore them, Tokiomi.

216
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,839
Their actions are in clear
violation of the rules.

217
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,174
Of course.

218
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,303
As one responsible for guarding
the secrets of magic, I cannot allow it.

219
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:15,183
We shall have to eliminate
Caster and his Master.

220
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:20,188
The problem is that defeating
a Servant requires a Servant.

221
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,317
And we can't send my Assassin.

222
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,782
Minor rule changes
fall under my purview.

223
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,411
We'll have all the Masters
work to defeat Caster.

224
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,583
Archer?

225
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,088
There are fewer bottles than in
Tokiomi's room, but of higher quality.

226
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,215
Some apprentice he has.

227
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,050
What do you want?

228
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,886
Apparently, there were those,

229
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,472
...other than myself,
with time on their hands.

230
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:56,975
Time on their hands?

231
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,895
Otherwise, a Master under
Church protection...

232
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,939
...would hardly need wander about.

233
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,066
What are you talking about?

234
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,738
Are you dissatisfied with
your contract, Gilgamesh?

235
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,242
Tokiomi invited me to this world,
and he maintains my form here.

236
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:19,330
And his greeting was worthy of my station.
I had to respond to that.

237
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,585
But I never thought
he'd be so boring a person...

238
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,254
You are unhappy with him
as your master?

239
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,382
To reach the Vortex of the Root?

240
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,343
What a tedious plan.

241
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,264
The desire for the Root...

242
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,767
...is unique to mages.

243
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,353
It's not for outsiders to comment upon.

244
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,106
In a sense, the path to the Root...

245
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,193
...is the path to an escape
from this world.

246
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,196
For us who are interested
only in the world itself,

247
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,407
...it may well be a tedious plan.

248
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,992
Is that so...

249
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,830
True, I am full of love for this
universe that is my playground.

250
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,584
I have no interest in realms
that lie outside my dominion.

251
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,420
This Root of yours does not
concern me in the least.

252
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:12,008
Perhaps, but the Grail is not a device
specifically designed to seek the Root.

253
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,511
When we say that it is omnipotent,

254
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:20,308
...we mean that it has limitless potential
to alter even the material world.

255
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,977
So you're saying that
the other Masters...

256
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,481
...have motives other than Tokiomi's
for wanting the Grail?

257
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,985
Tokiomi is an archetypal mage,
and at the same time, ultra right-wing.

258
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:37,492
What the others seek is success
here in the material world.

259
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,120
Prestige. Desires. Power.

260
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:44,165
That suits me fine.
I love all of those things.

261
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,420
You are a king who rules over
the vulgar, Gilgamesh.

262
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,507
Then what of you, Kirei?

263
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,224
What do you want from the Grail?

264
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,684
Me?

265
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,604
I have no real desire for it.

266
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,690
I doubt that.

267
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:13,987
Doesn't the Grail call only those
who are worthy of it?

268
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,488
So they say.

269
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,574
But I do not understand.

270
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:22,620
I have no ideal or other desire,
so why choose me for this battle?

271
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,165
No ideal or other desire...

272
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,209
Then why not wish for joy?

273
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,211
Ridiculous. Joy?

274
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,174
You'd ask me to long for something
that blasphemous and sinful?

275
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,884
Blasphemous?

276
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,387
Sinful?
That's going a little far.

277
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,723
Why draw a connection
between joy and sin?

278
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,392
I...

279
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,063
True, joy gained by evil
means could be a sin.

280
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,400
But joy may be attained
through good deeds, as well.

281
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,697
What kind of philosophy
calls joy itself a sin?

282
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,950
Joy is another quality I lack.

283
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,578
I seek it, but never find it.

284
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,081
Kirei Kotomine...

285
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,793
I find myself taking
an interest in you.

286
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,129
What do you mean?

287
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,925
Just what as I said.
Be seated.

288
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,685
Joy, you see, might be thought of
as a form of the soul.

289
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,732
The question isn't whether it exists,
but whether you know it.

290
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,445
Kirei, you have yet to see
what form your soul has taken.

291
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,741
That's what it means when you claim
that you lack joy.

292
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,411
A mere Servant means to lecture me?

293
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,455
Don't get cocky, mongrel.

294
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,542
These are words of a king who has tasted all
the pleasures and luxuries the world has to offer.

295
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,419
Hold your tongue and
mark my words.

296
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,467
Kirei, you ought to learn
what pleasure is.

297
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,678
Look first to the outside.

298
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,054
I know...

299
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,308
Why not begin by joining me
in my entertainment?

300
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,145
I have no time to waste on trivialities.

301
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,189
Don't be like that.

302
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,693
You can do it between
the jobs Tokiomi assigns you.

303
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,695
To begin with, Kirei,

304
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,449
...your task is to watch
the five other Masters, yes?

305
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,159
What Of it?

306
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,787
You should learn not only
their plans and strategies,

307
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,331
...but their motivations, as well.

308
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,667
Then tell them to me.

309
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,963
That would be possible
if I asked the Assassins.

310
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,718
But, Archer, what does it matter to you?

311
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:45,096
I told you. I enjoy watching humans.

312
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,559
One or two are sure to be interesting.

313
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,687
Compared to Tokiomi, at least.

314
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,442
Very well, Archer.
I accept.

315
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,153
But it will take some time.

316
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,531
That's fine. I shall be patient.

317
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,534
And avail myself of these drinks...

318
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,500
My reason for seeking the Grail?

319
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,337
I said far too much.

320
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,924
It certainly isn't joy.

321
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,561
<i>However, if I can learn about that man,</i>

322
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,817
<i>...will I be able to also learn
what it is I seek?</i>

323
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,781
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya...</i>

324
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,951
Episode 6:
A Night of Schemes

325
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:57,168
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

326
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:05,968
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

327
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:20,983
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

328
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:29,242
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

329
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:38,334
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

330
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:44,674
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

331
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:53,349
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

332
00:23:53,433 --> 00:24:00,273
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

333
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:08,364
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

334
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:16,789
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

335
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,794
I'll explain the temporary change
in the rules.

336
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,671
They'll kill Kiritsugu Emiya...

337
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,715
We can escape!
If we go now, we can still...

338
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,009
It will be my lance
that takes Saber's life!

339
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,595
I'm not interested in fighting you
for the Grail!

340
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,973
Don't get any ideas, bitch!
