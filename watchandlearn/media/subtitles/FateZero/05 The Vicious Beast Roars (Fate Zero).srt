1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,968
My name is Iskandar,
the King of Conquerors!

2
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:13,973
In this Grail War,
I am of the Rider class.

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,228
Wh-What are you thinking,
you idiot?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,321
Fate has brought us together
to do battle for the Grail.

5
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,366
But first, I wish to
make a proposition.

6
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:39,540
What think you of yielding
the Grail to me, and joining my army?

7
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,210
You would be treated
as honored allies.

8
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:48,090
And together, we shall share in
the joy of world conquest!

9
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,555
I am afraid I must decline.

10
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:01,729
I may give the Grail to but one man:
my new avowed lord.

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,107
Not to you, Rider!

12
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:13,407
Did you interfere with our battle merely
to proffer that ridiculous plan?

13
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,494
If so, it is a grave insult!

14
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,749
I'd be willing
to discuss compensation.

15
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,833
Shut up!

16
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,712
And further,

17
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,966
...I am the rightful King of Britain.

18
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,221
I could never lower myself to mere retainer,
even in service to a mighty king.

19
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,308
King of Britain, you say!
What a surprise!

20
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,229
I'd hardly have expected
the King of Knights to be a little girl.

21
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,607
Then would you like to taste
this little girl's blade,

22
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,234
...King of Conquerors?

23
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,696
I suppose negotiations have failed.

24
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,866
Such a waste. What a shame...

25
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,662
Rider!

26
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:19,223
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

27
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:25,396
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

28
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,777
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

29
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:38,450
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

30
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:44,623
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

31
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:52,339
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

32
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,634
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

33
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,637
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

34
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:04,602
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

35
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,232
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

36
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,986
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

37
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:20,784
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

38
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:26,832
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

39
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,308
That moron nearly conquered
the known world?

40
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,936
What is wrong with you?

41
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,606
So you were the one, eh?

42
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:59,073
I'd wondered what madness had
compelled you to steal my relic.

43
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:05,412
I never imagined that you yourself
planned to enter the Holy Grail War...

44
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,792
Waver Velvet.

45
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:18,092
How would you like me
to offer you a private lesson?

46
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:22,638
How mages really kill one another...

47
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,309
I'll teach you all about
the fear and pain involved.

48
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,812
You should feel honored.

49
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,945
Mage!

50
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:44,994
So you were to be my Master,
rather than this boy.

51
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,955
Absurd...

52
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:54,712
Only one brave enough to ride the battlefield
at my side could ever be my Master.

53
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,465
A coward who lacks sufficient
courage to show himself...

54
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,218
...is nowhere close
to being worthy!

55
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,643
And there are others, as well!

56
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,479
Out there, skulking in the darkness!

57
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,565
What do you speak of, Rider?

58
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,152
Saber. And Lancer.

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,614
Your duel was magnificent.

60
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,868
Surely, the sound of your blades...

61
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,373
...called other Heroic Spirits
than myself here.

62
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:36,378
Heroic Spirits, born again through
the Holy Grail, gather here and now!

63
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:40,132
Those too craven to show themselves...

64
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:46,013
...will draw the scorn of Iskandar,
King of Conquerors!

65
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,184
This is...

66
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,685
Yes.

67
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,228
Quite unfortunate.

68
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,856
Quite unfortunate indeed.

69
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,824
That's...

70
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,410
The Servant that defeated Assassin?

71
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:17,920
So, two lesser beings dare to name
themselves kings, even in my presence.

72
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,923
I fail to see where the problem lies...

73
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,929
I am Iskandar,
the legendary King of Conquerors.

74
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:32,768
What nonsense.
I am the one true king.

75
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,938
All others are mere pretenders.

76
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,483
If you're that insistent,
then why not name yourself?

77
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:45,447
No true king should be troubled
by giving his name.

78
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,282
So you would question me,

79
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,867
...pretender?

80
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,203
Me, the king?

81
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:57,042
If, even in the presence of my glory,
you cannot discern my identity,

82
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:01,130
your blindness will seal your doom!

83
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,511
I see.
So that is how he killed Assassin.

84
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,225
That is his Noble Phantasm.

85
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,152
Kill.

86
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,288
Berserker?

87
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:40,002
Hey, King of Conquerors.
Were you planning to ask him, too?

88
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:45,924
He doesn't seem terribly
interested in negotiations, does he?

89
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:50,512
Boy... How powerful a Servant is he?

90
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,807
I don't know.
I can't tell!

91
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,270
What?
Are you not a Master?

92
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,025
You can sense their strengths
and weaknesses, right?

93
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:10,324
I can't tell. That black thing is
definitely a Servant,

94
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,452
...but I can't read its status or
anything else about it!

95
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,374
It appears it will be
another difficult enemy.

96
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,504
That spirit has some curse
or other special ability...

97
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,632
...that entirely conceals
everything about him.

98
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,717
But that isn't all.

99
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:33,096
With four others present,
we have to be very careful.

100
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,934
Why did he materialize here?

101
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,686
No sane Master...

102
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,273
...would choose to send out
their Servant here.

103
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,735
Not into the middle
of all this chaos.

104
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,863
Maiya, keep watching Assassin.

105
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,783
I'll look for Berserker's Master.

106
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:03,126
Who gave you permission
to look upon me, you rabid dog?

107
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:10,092
May your death provide me
some modicum of entertainment, mongrel!

108
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,479
Is that truly Berserker?

109
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:28,193
For a madman, he's rather nimble.

110
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,613
What, you couldn't tell?

111
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,159
That black thing casually snatched the
first blade that was flying toward him,

112
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,162
...using it to destroy
the second spear as it approached.

113
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,963
You dare lay your filthy hands
on my treasures?

114
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,882
You must long for death, cur!

115
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,804
That's impossible!

116
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:02,311
Let us see just how long
your parlor tricks...

117
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,063
...can keep you alive!

118
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,487
Fool...

119
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,323
I belong among the heavens,

120
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,575
...yet you would have me
trod the same earth as you?!

121
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,870
Your impudence has
guaranteed your death!

122
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,583
Mongrel, nothing will
remain of your corpse!

123
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,216
Gilgamesh is serious.

124
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,013
He plans to open
the Gate of Babylon even further.

125
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,142
Repeatedly exposing
his Noble Phantasm to the others...

126
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,852
How rash.

127
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,897
Your decision, my Master?

128
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,904
<i>By the power of my Command Seal,</i>

129
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,991
<i>...King of Heroes,
quell thine anger and withdraw.</i>

130
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,915
You dare to order
a king to withdraw?

131
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,543
You have nerve, Tokiomi.

132
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,800
You were fortunate, mad dog.

133
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,510
Mongrels!

134
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,555
By our next meeting, see that
you've culled your numbers.

135
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,392
Only a true hero is worthy
to look upon me.

136
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:15,652
It would seem that Archer's Master
is less stubborn than he is.

137
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,167
Irisviel, get back!

138
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,218
What?

139
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,728
So that's it...

140
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:55,150
Whatever he grabs becomes
his Noble Phantasm.

141
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,404
Saber?

142
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,494
We", Maiya?

143
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,164
Do you have a visual on
Berserker's Master?

144
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,957
No, I don't.

145
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,461
This looks bad.

146
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,338
Damn.

147
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,509
What are you?

148
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,990
That's enough messing around, Berserker.

149
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,869
Saber has a prior engagement
with me.

150
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:53,542
If you insist on interfering,
you'll have to face me.

151
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,793
Lancer...

152
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,046
What are you doing, Lancer?

153
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:02,425
This is your chance to defeat Saber.

154
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,721
I, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne,
will defeat Saber...

155
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,723
I swear it on my honor!

156
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:14,020
If you insist I kill her here,
then I will first defeat that mad dog.

157
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,523
Please, my Master!

158
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,278
<i>With my Command Seal,
I order you...</i>

159
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,362
My lord!

160
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,411
<i>Help Berserker kill Saber.</i>

161
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,421
Lancer!

162
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,184
Saber, I'm sorry...

163
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,982
Irisviel, I shall hold them here.

164
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:03,153
While I do, you must run...

165
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,988
As far away as you can get.

166
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,450
Irisviel, please!

167
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,161
It's all right, Saber.

168
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,830
Believe in your Master!

169
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,126
<i>Kiritsugu is here?</i>

170
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,340
<i>Kiritsugu, I know that
you can still turn this to victory.</i>

171
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,802
I'll kill Lancer's Master now.

172
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,181
It's the only way out of this.

173
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,560
Maiya, attack Assassin on my mark.

174
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,562
Suppressive fire.

175
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,147
Acknowledged.

176
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,653
Six...

177
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,613
Five...

178
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,157
Four...

179
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,660
Three...

180
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,496
Two...

181
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,540
One.

182
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,673
Rider!

183
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,193
Ah...

184
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,530
This is a tough one.

185
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,833
As you can see, our black friend
will be retiring for the evening.

186
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:45,088
Master of Lancer. I know not
from whence you're watching,

187
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,341
...but do not sully a battle
between knights with your petty tricks.

188
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,343
Have Lancer withdraw.

189
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,680
If you insist on humiliating him further,

190
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
...then I shall join Saber.

191
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,562
Together, the two of us will
annihilate your Servant.

192
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:01,855
What will it be?

193
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,360
Withdraw, Lancer.

194
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,696
That's enough for tonight.

195
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,450
My thanks, King of Conquerors.

196
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,162
It was nothing. I enjoy watching
the flowers of a battlefield in bloom.

197
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:35,680
When you first arrived, what was
your intent, King of Conquerors?

198
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,101
I try not to think too hard
about such things.

199
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:45,774
Saber... First,
settle matters with Lancer.

200
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:51,154
And then, I shall face the victor,
be it you or Lancer.

201
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,616
King of Knights, goodbye for now!

202
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:59,454
I hope to enjoy our next meeting
as much as I did this one.

203
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,750
Boy, you got anything nice
to say to the lady?

204
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,675
I do wish he'd man up a little...

205
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,516
Farewell!

206
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,772
Saber, your left arm!

207
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,817
Yes, it was a painful blow.

208
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,693
It is as Rider says.

209
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:35,323
If I fail to deal with Lancer first and
undo the curse on this wound,

210
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,243
...it will damage my chances
against the other Servants.

211
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,956
Thank you, Saber.

212
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,000
I survived thanks to you...

213
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,420
The reason I could focus on
the battle before me...

214
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,965
...was that I had you to stand behind me.

215
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,425
Saber...

216
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,679
The battle is only beginning, Irisviel.

217
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:03,184
Tonight, we saw the mere opening gambits
of a battle that is just beginning to unfold.

218
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,562
That's right.

219
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,106
They were all powerful adversaries.

220
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,901
Not one of them was
a conventional enemy.

221
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,780
So this is the Holy Grail War.

222
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,455
They all turned and
ran from my Berserker...

223
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:29,419
And I embarrassed that arrogant ass!

224
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,048
Tokiomi, how I wish
I could have seen your face.

225
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,311
That damn Berserker broke free of
my control and started fighting Saber...

226
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,732
If he keeps doing that,
my body won't last long.

227
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,527
But if I can control him,
I can win.

228
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,452
Just hold on, Sakura.

229
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,959
Begging your pardon, Master Kirei.

230
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,419
What is it?

231
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:17,175
Right, I've come to report that I found
something of interest, outside the church.

232
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,302
A familiar?

233
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,639
Yes. It was outside the barrier,

234
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:27,143
...but it was clearly sent to
monitor this church.

235
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,320
Awesome!
That was so awesome!

236
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,783
Hey, Bluebeard...
That was all real, right?

237
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,578
It was for real, and not
some kind of special effect?

238
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,455
So awesome...

239
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,916
So, the Grail War, right?

240
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,293
You're gonna do it.
Right, big guy?

241
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,338
Big guy?

242
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,882
My wish has come true...

243
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,386
Come true...

244
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,553
Um..

245
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,686
Look at her! She is the answer!

246
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,815
Her beautiful face, her noble bearing...

247
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:19,445
She is none other than
the maiden of my dreams!

248
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,827
Someone you know?

249
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,370
Indeed!

250
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:33,001
She was forsaken by God,
died in shame, and now...

251
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,545
At last, she has
come back to life!

252
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,839
Such... Such a miracle.

253
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,844
What else could it be but
the fulfillment of my dreams?!

254
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,846
Oh, maiden...

255
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,557
MY holy virgin...

256
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,728
Soon, I will come for you.

257
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,941
Episode 5:
A Wicked Beast's Roar

258
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:05,158
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

259
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:13,958
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

260
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:28,973
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

261
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:37,231
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

262
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:46,324
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

263
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:52,663
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

264
00:22:53,206 --> 00:23:01,339
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

265
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:08,262
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

266
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:16,354
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

267
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:24,779
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

268
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,659
I promise you Saber's head.

269
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,910
The next strike will be for real!

270
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,079
Aren't you the one who's mistaken?

271
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,833
Behold the magic of Kayneth El-Melloi...

272
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,584
You mean to lecture me?

273
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,963
I've come for you, my holy virgin.
