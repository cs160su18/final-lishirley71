1
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,315
Rider?

2
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:27,153
Hey!

3
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,614
What are you thinking,
breaking the shutter open like that?

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,909
Why didn't you go to spirit form,
like when you entered?

5
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:37,705
I cannot carry these
while I'm in spirit form.

6
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,958
Don't whine so much.

7
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,003
You sound like a thief.

8
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,173
If you aren't a thief,
what are you?

9
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,633
Something entirely different.

10
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,387
A cowardly thief sneaks away
in the night.

11
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:58,893
If you stride away, bursting with song,
then you are a conquering king!

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,020
Just what I needed...

13
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,231
Get lost... Get lost now.
Right now!

14
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,651
Very well! Then I shall leave you
to carry the spoils.

15
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,195
Do not drop them.

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,993
Why is this happening
to me?!

17
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:35,221
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

18
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:41,352
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

19
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:47,733
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

20
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:54,448
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

21
00:01:54,532 --> 00:02:00,621
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

22
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:08,337
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,590
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

24
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,635
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

25
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:20,558
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

26
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,230
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

27
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,984
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

28
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:36,740
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

29
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:42,830
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

30
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,054
The summoning worked,
so why do I have to do this?

31
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,266
What's so important about
these books, anyway?

32
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,604
I told you.
We prepare for war.

33
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,690
And one cannot wage war
without maps.

34
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,484
Hey, boy.

35
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,778
Where are Macedonia
and Persia?

36
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,780
Y-You can't talk to me
like that!

37
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,782
I'm your Master--

38
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,081
I am well aware of your status
as my Master.

39
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,959
We forged a pact,
did we not?

40
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,211
Yes.

41
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:36,342
But I'm more interested in learning
what has become of my old territories.

42
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,471
I think they're over here.

43
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:50,648
So tiny! I spent my life conquering
that land, and behold how puny it is!

44
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,567
Very well! I can't wait!

45
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,406
And where on the map
are we now, boy?

46
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,158
Here.

47
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,328
So, the other side
of the round land?

48
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,706
Pleasing news indeed!

49
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,542
This will guide us
in the coming battles.

50
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,002
Guide us?

51
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,338
First, we journey to the
other side of the world.

52
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,258
We go west.
Due west!

53
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,678
And we shall conquer
every land we pass through!

54
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,347
I shall return to Macedonia
in triumph,

55
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,684
...and my people will hold a festival
in honor of my revival!

56
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,271
How splendid will that be?!

57
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,065
Why do you think
you're here, anyway?

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,276
Don't forget about
the Holy Grail War!

59
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,402
Indeed!

60
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,699
That's right. Speaking of the Grail,
I have neglected to ask one thing.

61
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,743
What will you do
with the Grail?

62
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,538
Wh-What's it to you?

63
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,123
What do you care?

64
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:54,920
If you are also intent on world conquest,
that would make you my enemy.

65
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,048
The world cannot serve
two lords.

66
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,176
World conquest?

67
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,055
I-I'll tell you what I want...

68
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,059
I just want people
to treat me fairly.

69
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,272
I want to make all those at the Clock Tower
who never gave me a chance...

70
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,274
...to admit they were wrong!

71
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,775
Small!

72
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,489
So very small! And narrow-minded.
And stupid.

73
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:27,161
In this battle, your only concern
is for your reputation?

74
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,413
And you dare call yourself
my Master?

75
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,041
What a disappointment!

76
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,755
If you wish so desperately
for others to fear you,

77
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,384
...perhaps you should
use the Grail's power...

78
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,846
...to grow another
30 centimeters or so.

79
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,813
<i>He's supposed to be my Servant...
He can't talk to me that way!</i>

80
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,274
<i>I'll show him!</i>

81
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,027
<i>I address the command seal.</i>

82
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:06,825
<i>In accordance with the Grail's laws, I order
this man, Iskandar the Conqueror--</i>

83
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,413
<i>Calm down, Waver.</i>

84
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:16,960
<i>A Master can only use his command seal
to compel his Servant's obedience three times.</i>

85
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:22,049
<i>If I use all my command seals,
I won't be able to control him.</i>

86
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,307
As long as I get the Grail,
it doesn't matter.

87
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,976
I don't care what
you do after that, so-

88
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,647
I shall acquire the Grail
for you.

89
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:42,152
You seem confident.
Have you made any plans?

90
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,157
So, you wish to see my power.
Is that correct?

91
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,993
N-Naturally!

92
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,288
You need to prove
that I can rely on you!

93
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,045
I am Iskandar,
King of Conquerors!

94
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,507
With this swing of my sword,
I declare my supremacy!

95
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,296
This is the ox-chariot that
King Gordius once offered up to Zeus.

96
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:48,051
Its renown must be the source
of my designation as Rider class.

97
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:54,141
If you want the Grail, then find me
another hero or two!

98
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,062
Until then, I shall entertain myself
with these maps.

99
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,065
That will not pose a problem,
I take it?

100
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,408
All right... I won't lose today!

101
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,875
There it is.

102
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:25,464
No way! Where is it?
I'm sure I didn't overlook it!

103
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,092
That's the first
chestnut bud today.

104
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,304
First point goes to me.

105
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,599
I-I'm not going
to lose!

106
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,104
There's one!

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,818
I found one, too!

108
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,071
I found my second.

109
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,868
Hey, that isn't a
chestnut branch.

110
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:59,081
No, Ilya. That's called
a wingnut.

111
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:03,627
It's similar to a chestnut.
So it's a chestnut bud, too.

112
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,422
No fair!

113
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,758
No fair! No fair!

114
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,469
You've been cheating
this whole time!

115
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,974
But Daddy can't win
against you otherwise.

116
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:21,812
If you keep cheating,
I won't play with you, Kiritsugu!

117
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,315
I don't want that! I'm sorry!
I apologize!

118
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,735
Do you promise not
to cheat anymore?

119
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,529
I do, 1 do!

120
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,241
Very well. Then I'll
challenge you again.

121
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,119
A champion accepts
all challengers!

122
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,831
Indeed. I am honored,
Your Highness!

123
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,168
I'm SO high up!

124
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,258
What are you
looking at, Saber?

125
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,055
Your daughter and Kiritsugu
are playing outside.

126
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,060
Surprised?

127
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,524
I was under the impression that
my Master was colder than that.

128
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,069
Well, I can see how you
might think that.

129
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,159
If that is Kiritsugu's true self,

130
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,622
...I must have gravely
offended him.

131
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,501
Irisviel! You don't
have to laugh.

132
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,587
I'm sorry...

133
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,716
I was wondering if the incident during
your summoning still bothers you.

134
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,801
Some.

135
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,347
True, I did pretend
to be a man in life,

136
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,059
...but surely there was no need for you two
to be so shocked when you saw me.

137
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,813
Well, you know...
We couldn't help it.

138
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:52,653
Your legend... King Arthur's legend...
It's simply too famous.

139
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,780
Do you suppose Kiritsugu...

140
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,993
...might underestimate my ability
because I am a woman?

141
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,746
Never. But...

142
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:08,669
You're right... If he is upset,
there's another reason.

143
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,961
Another?

144
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:16,343
He's probably upset at the people
who were around you.

145
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:23,558
The ones cruel enough to force
the role of king upon a little girl.

146
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,103
It was inevitable.

147
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,524
I had resigned myself to that fate when
I drew forth the sword from the stone.

148
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:37,280
That upsets him even more.
Your resignation to your fate.

149
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,159
Then he forgets his place.

150
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,747
He hasn't the right to question
decisions made...

151
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,458
...by those of my time,
including myself.

152
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,128
That is why he says nothing.

153
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:58,218
Kiritsugu Emiya and the hero Arturia
will never see eye to eye.

154
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,180
He must have resigned
himself to that fact.

155
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,442
He wants to use the Grail's power
to save the world.

156
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,611
That is his ambition.
And yours, correct?

157
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,950
Yes, but I get my beliefs
from him.

158
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,079
My own desire for the Grail
is the same.

159
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:32,502
I wish to save Britain, since I was
unable to protect it in life.

160
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,424
I think what you
and Kiritsugu seek is right.

161
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,551
I believe it is something
you can be proud of.

162
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,979
Our next match won't be until you
come home from Japan, right?

163
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,230
That's right.

164
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,735
How long will your work keep you
and Mommy away, Kiritsugu?

165
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,111
When will you come back?

166
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,032
I'll be back in
two weeks or so.

167
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,119
Your mom won't be back for
quite a while, though.

168
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,872
Yeah, Mommy told me already.

169
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,833
She said we'd be apart
for a long time.

170
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,213
She said that even if we don't
see each other for a long time,

171
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,965
...she'd always be by my side.

172
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,470
So I shouldn't feel lonely.
She told me before I went to sleep.

173
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,557
I'm gonna be together with
Mommy forever and ever!

174
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,227
I see.

175
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,153
Listen, Ilya.

176
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,991
Kiritsugu?

177
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,912
Can you wait for me, Ilya?

178
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,749
Even if you're lonely, can you
hold on until I come home?

179
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,751
Yeah!

180
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,089
Then I promise you.

181
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,260
I'll be home before
you know it.

182
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:13,937
Fill, fill, fill 'er up, fill...

183
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,023
Repeat... Four times...

184
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,942
Or was it five?

185
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,113
Um, destroy each time
it is filled...

186
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,614
Right?

187
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,996
Fill, fill, fill, fill and fill.

188
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,081
That's five times!

189
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,291
Okay.

190
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,879
<i>At all three murder scenes,</i>

191
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,800
<i>...a mysterious pentagram was found,
drawn in the victims' blood.</i>

192
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,470
Maybe I went a bit too far...

193
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,974
<i>This symbol's purpose remains unclear.</i>

194
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,102
<i>Today, we've invited a professor who
specializes in criminal psychology to-</i>

195
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,484
Do you believe
in demons, kiddo?

196
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:07,866
All the papers and magazines
call me a demon.

197
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:13,330
But suppose demons really did exist.
Wouldn't that be rude?

198
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,874
You've gotta be clear
about these things.

199
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,836
Yo! I'm Ryunosuke Uryu,
and I'm a demon!

200
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,589
I dunno if that's exactly the
right way to go about it.

201
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,551
And then, I found this.

202
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,721
It's some old book
from our storehouse.

203
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:34,893
Looks like my ancestors were researching
how to summon demons.

204
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,606
Like, so I've just gotta find out
if there really are demons!

205
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,982
But you know...

206
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,653
If a demon really did appear,

207
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:49,324
...it'd be pretty stupid to just
chat with it and send it back.

208
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,034
So, kid...

209
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:56,456
If a demon does show up,
would you mind letting it kill you?

210
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,216
I wonder what it's like,
being killed by a demon?

211
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,760
Not many people
get to find out! Ow!

212
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,888
What's that?

213
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,081
I ask you...

214
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,792
You who calls to me...
You who seeks me...

215
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,338
O summoner who manifests me
within the vessel of a Caster,

216
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,465
...I ask your name.

217
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,591
Who...

218
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,928
<i>n n</i>

219
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,391
Um...

220
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,476
I'm Ryunosuke Uryu.

221
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,272
Currently working odd jobs.
My hobby is murder of all varieties.

222
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,566
I like kids and little girls.

223
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,611
Very well. The pact is sealed.

224
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:13,116
I desire the Grail, as do you.

225
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,788
The vessel of paradise
will be ours.

226
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,832
The Grai... What?

227
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,628
Anyway, how about a sacrifice?

228
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,797
Wanna eat this kid?

229
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,808
Wow... That's human skin, isn't it?

230
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,812
Cthulhu fhtagn...

231
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,593
Don't be scared, child.

232
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,813
Can you stand?

233
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:32,028
Now, child, you can leave the room
through that door.

234
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,988
Can you manage that
by yourself?

235
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,198
Yeah.

236
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,288
Hey, what're you thinking?

237
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,239
Terror has degrees of freshness.

238
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,494
The more intense the fear,
the more all other emotions die.

239
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,080
Terror, in its truest sense,

240
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,333
...is not a static state,
but rather a dynamic one.

241
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,630
It is the moment when hope
turns to despair.

242
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,092
Did you enjoy that?

243
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,637
The taste of fresh terror
and death.

244
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,600
Cool!

245
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,103
You're awesome!
You're so cool!

246
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,897
Okay!

247
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,942
I don't know about this Grail crap,
but from now on, I'm with you!

248
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,110
Let's go kill some people!

249
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,864
I want you to show me
even cooler ways to kill!

250
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,743
Ryunosuke, was it?

251
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,706
What a magnificent omen, to be blessed with
an understanding Master like yourself.

252
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,419
I feel my dream is nearly
within my grasp.

253
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,423
Oh, hey. I didn't get
your name.

254
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,217
MY name?

255
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,639
Let me see. In this era,
the most common name for me is...

256
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:29,979
I believe I will
call myself Bluebeard.

257
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,152
The Church contacted me.

258
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,949
They said that the seventh Servant,
Caster, has appeared.

259
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:45,203
The final Servant has been summoned?
Then it's time.

260
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,580
Indeed.

261
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:52,460
You are to head immediately
for Tohsaka manor.

262
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,796
And once I arrive?

263
00:20:55,171 --> 00:21:01,803
The manor's powerful magical barriers
should be child's play to you.

264
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,640
Are you sure about this?

265
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:10,019
I was under the impression that you
were allies with Tokiomi Tohsaka.

266
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,063
Don't worry about that.

267
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,566
Even if it means fighting Archer,

268
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,610
...there's no need to fear.

269
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:23,449
<i>No need to fear Archer, one of
the three Great Knight classes?</i>

270
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,870
I leave the rest to you.

271
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,959
Eliminate Tokiomi Tohsaka
at once.

272
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,438
<i>This will be easy.</i>

273
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,072
You're nothing but a worm.

274
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,075
Who gave you permission
to come here?

275
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,787
<i>No need...</i>

276
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,248
<i>...to fear that,</i>

277
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>u-he </i>

278
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,471
You are not worthy
to look upon me.

279
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:13,226
A worm should be
facing the ground...

280
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,811
...when it dies.

281
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,980
Episode 2:
The Fake First Shot

282
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:26,197
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

283
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:35,039
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

284
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:50,054
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

285
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:58,271
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

286
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:07,405
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

287
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:13,744
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

288
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:22,420
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

289
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:29,302
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

290
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:37,435
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

291
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:45,860
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

292
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,908
At last, it's time for the
Fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

293
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,910
It's unspeakably ugly.

294
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,745
Where is the item I left with you?

295
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,622
This will be fun!

296
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,915
Welcome.

297
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,958
Grant me victory!

298
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,002
Next Time: Fuyuki City
I will, without fail.
