1
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,633
Everything went smoothly.

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:14,181
These games of yours
squander my time, Tokiomi.

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,561
I am very grateful,
Gilgamesh...

4
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,274
...king of all kings,
King of Heroes.

5
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,988
Your deeds tonight will establish your
prowess as the King of Heroes.

6
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,242
And they will reveal which
of our foes we must hunt.

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:38,205
I ask only that you stay your hand
for just a short while longer.

8
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,292
Very well.

9
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:46,672
For the time being, I shall amuse myself
with simple reconnaissance.

10
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,301
This age fascinates me.

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,554
The modern world
is to your liking?

12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,223
It's unspeakably ugly.

13
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:59,393
But that is fine, in its own way.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,900
The important thing is whether any
treasures here are worthy of me.

15
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,489
If there is nothing here
that deserves my adoration,

16
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,826
...you will pay dearly
for summoning me,

17
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,328
...Tokiomi.

18
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,662
Worry not.

19
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:23,000
The Holy Grail is surely an item fit
to please the King of Heroes.

20
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,504
That is for me to determine.

21
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,172
No matter.

22
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,966
I'll play along with
your schemes for now.

23
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,887
Everything of value in this world
belongs to me.

24
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,349
No matter how precious a treasure
this Grail of yours may be,

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,395
...I'll never let anyone have it
without my permission.

26
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,525
Tokiomi, I'll leave the details to you.

27
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,368
My, my...

28
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,453
Honestly...

29
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,789
I'm still amazed that
Gilgamesh materialized...

30
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:06,502
...within the Archer class,
considering their solo combat skills.

31
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,591
Well, I can let Kirei
handle things from here.

32
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,762
For now, everything is proceeding
according to plan.

33
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:37,241
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:43,372
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

35
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:49,753
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

36
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,468
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

37
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:02,641
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

38
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:10,357
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

39
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:13,611
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

40
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,655
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

41
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,578
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

42
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:28,250
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

43
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:32,004
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

44
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:38,761
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

45
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:44,850
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

46
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,110
Assassin was killed?

47
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,072
Hey, Rider... This is big news!

48
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,783
One of the seven has already
been knocked out.

49
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,079
Hey...

50
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,458
Battle of Sky Battle of
Sky II The Imperial Army

51
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,339
Come on! Don't you get it?
Assassin was killed!

52
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:20,094
The Holy Grail War has started!

53
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,471
I've been out
gathering information,

54
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,432
...and day after day after day!
Every single day!

55
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,686
You sit around eating cookies,
watching stuff on the VCR!

56
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,438
You're worse than a familiar...
Worse than a rat!

57
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,567
And I told you to take spirit form
when I don't need you!

58
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,654
I'm giving you all the mana
you need to do your job.

59
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:43,284
Kid, no one cares
about Assassin.

60
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:48,372
He's only good at skulking in the shadows.
He could never pose a threat to me.

61
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,249
Anvway, boy...

62
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,376
Here, this is what matters!

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,005
This! The big, black thing
they call a "B-2."

64
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,256
It's wonderful!

65
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,551
I'm thinking of buying ten or so.
What do you think?

66
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,973
With that much money, it'd be faster
to just buy the country outright.

67
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,143
Oh... I see!

68
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,979
So, the question is where
to procure the money...

69
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,566
Were there some major
city nearby, such as Persepolis,

70
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,527
...we could simply plunder it
and get what we need.

71
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,824
For the moment, our biggest obstacle
will be this "Clinton" guy!

72
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,411
He will prove a more formidable
opponent than Darius III.

73
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,080
R-Regardless...

74
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,876
It's good that Assassin
was eliminated first.

75
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,921
Aren't you the type who prefers
to face his enemy head-on?

76
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:43,594
So it's good news for us that the guy who
uses sneak attacks and tricks is out.

77
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,181
We could get some good use
from these "Tomahawk" things, too!

78
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,851
Saber, Lancer, Archer,
the three Great Knights...

79
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,437
And the Berserker, whose sole
skill is to break things.

80
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,899
They're gonna be toast when you use
that Noble Phantasm of yours!

81
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,360
That just leaves Caster!

82
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,362
If we knew his true identity, we-

83
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,697
How did Assassin fall?

84
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,493
Who was it that defeated him?

85
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,870
You saw it, right?

86
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:14,291
I think it was Tohsaka's Servant.

87
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:19,421
His appearance, his attacks,
everything was gold and flashy.

88
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,632
It all happened so fast,
I couldn't tell-

89
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,758
Fool!

90
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,807
If I am to fight someone,
it will be the victor!

91
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,893
Why weren't you paying
attention to him?

92
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,728
Well, it matters not.

93
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:40,067
Did anything else strike you
about the flashy gold guy?

94
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,987
B-But it was the middle
of the night...

95
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,656
And it was all over
in a second.

96
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,369
Hey, Rider... Normally, a Servant only
has one Noble Phantasm, right?

97
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,788
That's the rule.

98
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,334
But "how many" isn't the right way to
conceptualize a Noble Phantasm.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,045
As you know,
a Noble Phantasm...

100
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,509
...is the physical manifestation
of a hero's legend or tale.

101
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:10,431
Sometimes, it may be a
specific ability or method of attack.

102
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,224
Then is there
a Noble Phantasm...

103
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,853
...that consists of throwing dozens
of swords at an opponent?

104
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,148
A sword that splits into
infinite copies?

105
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,942
It's possible...

106
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,946
That could still qualify as
a single Noble Phantasm.

107
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:32,411
<i>But those weren't copies.
Each sword had a different shape.</i>

108
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,038
Ah, forget it.

109
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:39,209
We'll learn each enemy's identity
as we encounter them.

110
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,924
I-Is that really wise?

111
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:46,884
It is!

112
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,719
Actually, it's more fun
this way!

113
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,889
Food, sex, sleep,
and war...

114
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,934
Whatever you do,
enjoy it to the fullest!

115
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,395
That is the secret of life.

116
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,527
Now, let's go find some
entertainment outside.

117
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,946
We ride forth, boy!
Prepare yourself.

118
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,782
R-Ride forth?
To where?

119
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,494
Somewhere!
Anywhere!

120
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,162
Oh, come on...

121
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,624
You can't have been the only one
who was watching Tohsaka.

122
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,419
Which means that news of Assassin's
death is making the rounds.

123
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,548
All the others are going to spring
into action all at once.

124
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,303
But we shall crush them
as we come across them.

125
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,430
Find and crush them...

126
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,973
It won't be that easy.

127
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,767
I am Rider.

128
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,605
My speed far exceeds
that of any other Servant.

129
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,653
Wait! Wait, wait!
Not here...

130
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,363
You'll blow up the house!

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,366
My Servant has been lost.

132
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,371
I have forfeited my rights as a Master
and cannot continue the Holy Grail War.

133
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,582
In accordance with the treaty,
I, Kirei Kotomine,

134
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,336
...ask that the Church
grant me sanctuary.

135
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,629
Your request is granted.

136
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:12,052
In my role as overseer, I,
Risei Kotomine, guarantee your safety.

137
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,887
Enter.

138
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,643
Father... Isn't anyone
watching this church?

139
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,519
No!

140
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,314
This place has been declared
a neutral sanctuary.

141
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,860
The Holy Church will censure any
Master who defies the decree.

142
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,405
Then it's safe...

143
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,906
Yes.

144
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,994
Keep watch, just in case.

145
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,955
Post one guard here at
all times, just to be sure.

146
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,417
Yes. Understood.

147
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,837
Who was watching the battle?

148
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:51,133
I detected the presence of familiars
from four separate Masters.

149
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:56,680
Two days ago, I confirmed the
summoning of the final Servant, Caster.

150
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,602
All the Holy Grail War Servants
have now arrived.

151
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,605
One unaccounted for, huh?

152
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,526
I had hoped that all the Masters
were watching.

153
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,114
At this point, observing the
three families' estates...

154
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,284
...is a Master's obvious
course of action.

155
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,496
If they can't even think
to do that,

156
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,169
...it would never occur to them
to worry about us Assassins.

157
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,759
We Heroic Spirits of the shadows
shall sneak up behind those Masters...

158
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,803
...who believe
Assassin to be dead.

159
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:41,016
And this time, we shall
become true shadow.

160
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,603
The battle has now begun.

161
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,774
At last, it's time for the
Fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

162
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:54,655
These old eyes of mine will finally
see a miracle performed.

163
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,466
So, this is where Kiritsugu
was born?

164
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,428
Well, Saber? How did you enjoy
your journey through the sky?

165
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:24,434
It was nothing to speak of.
Far simpler than I'd anticipated.

166
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,939
I suppose flying is nothing
to a hero, right?

167
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,941
That isn't it.

168
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:36,238
Upon materialization, Servants receive
knowledge of the modern world.

169
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,826
If required, I could even
pilot this aircraft.

170
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,829
You could pilot this?

171
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,125
My Riding skill allows me to
command any beast or vehicle,

172
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,795
...with the exception of
Phantasmal Beasts or Divine Beasts.

173
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,842
Once I put the saddle between my legs
and take the reins, intuition does the rest.

174
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,803
Put the saddle between
your legs and take the reins...

175
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,433
Did I say something amusing?

176
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,976
No.

177
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,732
Still, you must be the only Servant who has
flown in an airplane in physical form.

178
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:16,069
I apologize for that.
If only I could take spirit form...

179
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,322
No, I didn't mean it like that.
Don't worry about it.

180
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,616
I never get tired of watching you.

181
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,745
Irisviel, is there
something odd about me?

182
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,164
No, not at all.

183
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:32,085
When you laugh like that, there is
some hidden meaning behind it.

184
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,046
What is it? I want you
to be frank with me.

185
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:40,010
It means that your being stuck in
physical form isn't without its merits.

186
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,222
It's given me many enjoyable hours
choosing outfits for you.

187
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:49,853
Irisviel, is this manner of dress
truly common in this era?

188
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,648
I chose it to balance out my own outfit.
You don't care for it?

189
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,816
No, it is fine.

190
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,571
It is rather easy to move in, and besides,
I am used to dressing as a man.

191
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,161
This place is so alive...

192
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,373
Kiritsugu was set to have
arrived here already, yes?

193
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,043
Yes. Twelve hours before us.

194
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,546
But he'll find us.
Don't worry.

195
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,382
For the moment, we'll
keep an eye on things...

196
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,760
...so we can act when
the time comes.

197
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:26,890
We've come all this way to Japan.
I'd like to enjoy it before the fighting starts.

198
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,350
That's dangerous.

199
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:33,688
We should secure a base of operations
and then discuss plans with Kiritsugu.

200
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,650
I suppose you're right...

201
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,904
But it's such a waste.
We've come all this way.

202
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,697
And...

203
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,952
It's my first time.

204
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,495
Eh?

205
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,792
This is the first time I've ventured
into the world outside.

206
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:57,921
Then you've spent your
entire life in that castle?

207
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,302
Yes, I was a puppet created
for the Holy Grail War.

208
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,223
Of course, it isn't as though
I'm wholly ignorant of it.

209
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,268
Kiritsugu brought me
movies and pictures,

210
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,397
...and he's taught me all about
the outside world.

211
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,568
But this is the first time
I've seen it for myself.

212
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,444
So...

213
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,865
Forgive me.
I got overly excited.

214
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,287
Please stop the car.

215
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,505
Walking through the city will be
a new experience for me, as well.

216
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,557
But it is a knight's duty
to serve as escort.

217
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,642
I shall do my best.

218
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,770
Come with me.

219
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,420
The equipment you requested
has arrived.

220
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,633
The mistress and Saber
have arrived, as well.

221
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:30,013
The other Masters will likely
assume that she is Saber's Master.

222
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,348
Understood.

223
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,185
There was an incident last night
at the Tohsaka estate.

224
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,770
Here is the footage I recorded.

225
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,109
What do you make of this?

226
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,612
It seems too good to be true.

227
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,699
There is insufficient time
between Assassin's infiltration...

228
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,785
...and the Tohsaka
Servant's attack.

229
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,746
Assassin has a skill
that masks his presence,

230
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,457
...making it highly improbable that
he was detected in advance.

231
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,294
I believe Tohsaka was
expecting an intruder.

232
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:06,216
In a battle among Servants,
learning their identities is critical.

233
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,845
Why would Tohsaka expose
his Servant this way?

234
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,100
He had some reason to,
I suppose.

235
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,229
Maiya, what became of
Assassin's Master?

236
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,940
He took refuge in a church
last night.

237
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,193
The overseer declared him
to be under his protection.

238
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,571
Assassin's Master is Kirei Kotomine.

239
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,702
Maiya, set a familiar to watch
the Fuyuki Church.

240
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,787
Are you certain?

241
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,875
Masters are forbidden to take action
inside the neutral zone around a church.

242
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:46,214
Place it just far enough away
that the priest won't spot it.

243
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,717
Very well. Understood.

244
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,278
Where is the item
I left with you?

245
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,779
Right here.

246
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,589
Approximately two seconds,
I'd say.

247
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,174
I've slowed down.

248
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,425
Indeed.

249
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,811
Illya weighs less than
that Walther.

250
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,649
Even though she's eight
years old already...

251
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,993
Focus on the matter
at hand.

252
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,835
Think of nothing else.

253
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,480
It's wonderful, like a mirror
that reflects the night sky.

254
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:44,207
It's fun to walk around a new town,
accompanied by a gentleman.

255
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,168
Did I make an
acceptable gentleman?

256
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,712
You were perfect.

257
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,882
You were a wonderful
knight today.

258
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,885
You honor me, Highness.

259
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,392
Saber, do you like the sea?

260
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,728
I guess I don't really know.

261
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,691
In my country and in my time,

262
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,736
...the sea was the source of
constant barbarian attacks.

263
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,699
Sometimes, I hated it.
But I never felt any affection for it.

264
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,577
I feel kind of bad.

265
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:26,249
You're a girl, just as I am,
but when you were King Arthur,

266
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,502
...you never had the luxury of enjoying
simple things like this, did you?

267
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,714
What of you?

268
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,427
Surely, you would have preferred
Kiritsugu to escort you, right?

269
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,097
He couldn't...

270
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,933
It would only
cause him suffering.

271
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:49,355
Does Kiritsugu not enjoy the time
he spends with you?

272
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:55,320
When he's happy,
it causes him pain.

273
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,166
An enemy Servant?

274
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,375
Yes.

275
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,838
Making its presence known from
the shadows, 100 meters ahead.

276
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,300
It appears to be inviting us
to go see it.

277
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,219
How thoughtful.

278
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,138
It wishes to decide on
a battlefield.

279
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,182
Shall we take it up
on its invitation?

280
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,477
I'd like nothing better.

281
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,906
Rider... Let's go back down.

282
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
Right now!

283
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,996
What? This is the perfect
vantage point.

284
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:48,790
I'm climbing down!

285
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,918
No, take me back down!
I-I can't handle any more of this...

286
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,920
Calm yourself.

287
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,506
Waiting is a part of war.

288
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,134
I wanna go home. I wanna
go back to England...

289
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,012
I told you not to be
in such a hurry.

290
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,391
See? Things have finally
begun to unfold.

291
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,396
This will be fun!

292
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,569
Welcome.

293
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,366
I have spent the whole day
searching the city.

294
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,244
Everyone simply slinks away,
hiding in their little holes.

295
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,083
You alone have accepted
my offer.

296
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,795
That pure energy surrounding you...

297
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,048
You are Saber, I presume?

298
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,675
Indeed.

299
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,344
And you are Lancer.

300
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:50,935
Being unable to honorably name myself
to my opponent in combat troubles me.

301
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,896
I dislike these rules.

302
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,125
Saber... Be careful.

303
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,628
I can use healing magic
to act as support for you.

304
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,756
But more than that...

305
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,758
Leave Lancer to me.

306
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,970
But it troubles me that the other
Master has not shown himself.

307
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,765
Perhaps they plot something.

308
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,391
Watch yourself.

309
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,855
Irisviel, watch my back.

310
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,149
Very well, Saber.

311
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,109
Grant me victory!

312
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,987
I will.
Without fail!

313
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,869
Episode 3:
Fuyuki City

314
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:58,044
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

315
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:06,844
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

316
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:21,901
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

317
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:30,118
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

318
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:39,252
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

319
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:45,591
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

320
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:54,225
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

321
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:01,149
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

322
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:09,282
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

323
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:17,665
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

324
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,380
Let's see what you can do,
my adorable King of Knights.

325
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,716
Then the tales of the Saber-class
magic resistance were accurate.

326
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,134
This man is impressive!

327
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,052
That's enough fun
for now, Lancer.

328
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,721
What's happening?

329
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,932
I'll go... Take me with you, damn it!
