1
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,431
Irisviel...

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,083
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

3
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:47,048
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

4
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:53,345
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

5
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:58,309
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

6
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:06,150
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

7
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,445
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

8
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:15,659
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

9
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:20,831
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

10
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,167
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

11
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:28,047
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

12
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,217
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,594
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

14
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:40,351
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,347
<i>Have I lost them?</i>

16
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,810
<i>If I can't see them,
I'll sense them.</i>

17
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,567
<i>A chariot?
I have you, Rider!</i>

18
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,702
Rider, look.

19
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,747
Isn't that her following us?

20
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,043
Well, well, if it isn't Saber.

21
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,629
Saves us the trouble
of searching for her.

22
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,968
Actually... Hey, boy,
are motorcycles normally so fast?

23
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,596
That's a motorcycle?

24
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,764
No, that's impossible.

25
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,017
But with Saber's riding skill...

26
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,477
...that might make it possible.

27
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,230
This will be fun.

28
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:13,235
Then I'll have to make
this interesting.

29
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,279
We're going down?

30
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,405
Change of plans.

31
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,784
I shall use a race to
settle things with the girl.

32
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,671
Fine, but...
Be careful, okay?

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,132
Don't worry.

34
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,928
Nothing in Heaven or on
Earth can stop me!

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,907
<i>This is bad...
I'm reaching the machine's limits.</i>

36
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,367
<i>At this rate...</i>

37
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,913
<i>And I'm so close.</i>

38
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,642
<i>Invisible Air!</i>

39
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,900
No way...

40
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,200
She's closing the gap!

41
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,411
She'll catch up to us!

42
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,998
For a mechanical contraption
to go so fast...

43
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,457
Splendid.

44
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,377
But this is a chariot!

45
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,380
It may be a fair race,
but it needn't be polite.

46
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,761
This is what you get
if you want to chase me, Saber!

47
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,157
Excellent!

48
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,743
You really are the proud
King of Knights...

49
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,246
Truly the flower of
the battlefield!

50
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,793
Don't underestimate me,
King of Conquerors!

51
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,273
Rider!

52
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,609
Prepare yourself!

53
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,752
<i>Irisviel isn't here?</i>

54
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,713
No...

55
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,300
<i>That was definitely Rider.</i>

56
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,512
<i>Then, where is Irisviel?</i>

57
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,436
Did you think to trick me
by imitating a Servant?

58
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:40,567
Rider's master lacks the intel-gathering
skills to have found that place.

59
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,821
Tohsaka could not have
possibly attacked.

60
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,280
By process of elimination,

61
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,368
...only the Matou could
have kidnapped Irisviel.

62
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,124
Answer me.
Where is Irisviel?

63
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,502
I-I don't know!
I don't know anything!

64
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,296
Then where is Kariya Matou?

65
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,342
Kariya?
I don't know where that fool is!

66
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,515
I don't know!
I really don't know anything!

67
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,809
He left this morning with some guy...

68
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,395
...who said he was a judge
from the Church!

69
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,857
Overseer?

70
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,616
Kirei Kotomine...

71
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,498
I did not expect the real
Rider to appear.

72
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,209
A fortuitous development.

73
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,798
Luck certainly favors you on
the battlefield, doesn't it,

74
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,800
...Kariya Matou?

75
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,637
Father,
was this little deception...

76
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:55,017
...really worth the use of
two Command Seals?

77
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,270
Do not worry, Kariya.

78
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,648
Now, hold out your hand.

79
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,078
As long as you work with me,

80
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,832
...you may use your Command
Seals without hesitation.

81
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,586
Even so...

82
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,589
That transformation ability...

83
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,931
The Berserker class has such
excellent Noble Phantasms.

84
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:38,519
There are many stories of
them becoming another...

85
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,687
...in pursuit of some heroic deed.

86
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,901
So even with the Command Seal's
control, that is the best result.

87
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:50,781
Your Servant's fixation on
Saber is impressive.

88
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,617
Enough.
Begone, Berserker.

89
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,249
This woman...

90
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,628
Is she really the Grail's vessel?

91
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,923
More accurately, its contents.

92
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,717
Don't worry, Kariya.

93
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:15,138
I shall give you the Holy Grail.

94
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,140
But before that,

95
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,227
...there is the other promise
you made to me, Father.

96
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,231
Oh, that?
Everything is arranged.

97
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,026
Come to the Fuyuki church
at midnight tonight.

98
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,488
You will find Tokiomi Tohsaka there.

99
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,536
Don't forget, Kariya.

100
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,246
Tonight at midnight.

101
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,666
And your wish will be fulfilled.

102
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,463
Now, then...

103
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,383
We're alone.

104
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,804
I don't know who you are,
but show yourself.

105
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,143
So, you sensed me.

106
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,688
You are indeed a veteran Executor.

107
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,691
Zouken Matou?

108
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,610
Correct.

109
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,741
Hey, Rider...

110
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,411
We're really going to
attack from here?

111
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,788
From this range?

112
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,498
Straight ahead?

113
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,836
The sword of light we
saw at the river...

114
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,380
...has a delay before activation.

115
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,090
We'll strike then.

116
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,801
Why would you do
something so crazy?

117
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,804
Precisely because it is crazy.

118
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:43,560
If she loses after all this,
her defeat will be complete.

119
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:48,815
She may decide to be
my retainer, after all.

120
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,526
You want to win her so badly?

121
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,947
On the battlefield,
she is like a star.

122
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:01,536
But only as a part of my army
will she truly be able to shine.

123
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:10,128
<i>Never was he interested in his
opponent's power or wealth.</i>

124
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,215
<i>Without destroying or
degrading them,</i>

125
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,842
<i>...he sought to rule their very souls.</i>

126
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,929
<i>Thus was he the
King of Conquerors.</i>

127
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,890
Very well, Rider...

128
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,768
Win by whatever
means you wish.

129
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:29,356
Kid, it seems you finally begin
to understand conquest.

130
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,487
Glory lies beyond the horizon!

131
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,572
Let us go...

132
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,867
<i>Via Expugnatio!</i>

133
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,662
Wind!

134
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:04,141
<i>Excalibur!</i>

135
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,903
What do you want,
Zouken Matou?

136
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:24,161
I was quite interested to
see what clever trick...

137
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,122
...you'd use to destroy Kariya.

138
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,126
You're willing to let the Matous'
chance at victory dwindle?

139
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:37,048
In truth, watching him suffer...

140
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,470
I shall never tire of.

141
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,807
Victory for the Matou,
or a miserable end for him?

142
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,852
I'm honestly not sure
which I'd prefer.

143
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,608
You enjoy watching your son suffer so?

144
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,155
I'd thought that you would
have understood.

145
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,073
What?

146
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,161
You give off the same smell as I do.

147
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:15,754
That of a maggot, attracted by
the rotting meat of Kariya.

148
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,384
Oh, scary, scary.

149
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,012
Inexperienced or not,
you are still a dog of the Church.

150
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,681
I tease you at my own peril, eh?

151
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,685
We shall see each other again,
young one.

152
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,230
By our next meeting,

153
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,900
...see that you allow your true
nature to have ripened...

154
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,695
...such that it may rival my own.

155
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,172
Rider...

156
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,643
Sorry, boy.
I screwed up.

157
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,608
Rider!
Use Ionian Hetairoi!

158
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,198
The chariot is all I'm willing
to expend against Saber.

159
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,118
But still...

160
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,842
She's gone.

161
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,637
A motorcycle, huh?
A magnificent vehicle.

162
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,972
Hey!

163
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,100
Those are your first
words after defeat?

164
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,229
Hey, Rider...

165
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,983
How do we get back to town?

166
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:05,071
Well...
We'll have to walk.

167
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah, I guess so...

168
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,249
<i>How many more days do I have?</i>

169
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,337
<i>How many more times can I fight?</i>

170
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,472
<i>But I'm still alive now.</i>

171
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,516
<i>I'm still...</i>

172
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,293
Tokiomi Tohsaka!

173
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,012
Did you think you'd
killed me, Tokiomi?

174
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,056
You were wrong.

175
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:20,063
Until I make you pay,
I'll keep coming back!

176
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,324
Tohsaka...

177
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,935
What?

178
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,272
Kariya?

179
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:07,944
<i>Aoi?</i>

180
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,865
No! It wasn't me!
This was...

181
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,076
Are you satisfied, Kariya?

182
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:01,414
Now the Matou
are sure to win the Holy Grail.

183
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,629
I... I...

184
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,172
Why?

185
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,636
Taking Sakura from me
wasn't enough?

186
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,056
Of all the things you
could have done,

187
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,558
...you killed him in front of me?

188
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,938
Why?

189
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,022
He...

190
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,357
It's because of him!

191
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,860
If it weren't for him,
no one would have had to suffer!

192
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,446
You... Sakura...

193
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,909
You could have been happy!

194
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,536
Shut up!

195
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,458
What could you
possibly know of it?

196
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,544
You...

197
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,713
You've never even...

198
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,303
You've never loved anyone
in your entire life!

199
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,641
<i>I had someone I loved.</i>

200
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,853
<i>Warm and kind...</i>

201
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,313
<i>I wanted her to be happier
than anyone else.</i>

202
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,650
<i>For you, I would
throw away my life.</i>

203
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,320
<i>That's why I've endured
this pain until now.</i>

204
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,822
<i>Endured...</i>

205
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,992
<i>Endured, endured, endured, endured,
endured, endured, endured...</i>

206
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,577
<i>Endured it all!</i>

207
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,079
<i>You can't deny all that.
If you do, I'll never forgive you!</i>

208
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,748
<i>A lie, a lie, a lie!
I do have someone...</i>

209
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,793
<i>There is someone I love!</i>

210
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,421
<i>Who did I do this for?
Whose fault is it?!</i>

211
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,965
<i>If I'm going to die,
I may as well...</i>

212
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,303
That was a terrible play.

213
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,598
But not so bad for
a first attempt.

214
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,607
Well, Kirei?
What do you think?

215
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,951
The wine's taste...

216
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,830
It's different than
I remembered.

217
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,378
Then I see that you begin to
understand what it means...

218
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,463
...to expand your horizons.

219
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,804
<i>If it will taste this wonderful,</i>

220
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,766
<i>...then I would dearly love...</i>

221
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,394
<i>...to sample it again.</i>

222
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,940
Episode 21:
Knight on Two Wheels

223
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,738
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

224
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:06,784
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

225
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:15,835
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

226
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:22,967
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

227
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:30,850
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

228
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:35,772
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

229

Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

231

Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

232
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:56,667
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

233
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:04,258
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

234
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,803
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

235
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:11,766
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

236
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:18,314
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

237
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:24,278
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

238
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,782
By my Command Seal,
I order you...

239
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,367
Open your eyes, and behold!

240
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,494
Tonight, I shan't hold back.

241
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,663
He must be eliminated at once.

242
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,623
How do he and I differ?

243
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,708
If he doesn't doubt, then what?!

244
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,003
Who am I?
