1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,008
This is it.

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:11,971
What is that?

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,976
All of you, return to your posts.

4
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,771
It looks like a ball of mercury.

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,982
It's almost as if it's alive.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,406
I need to get this out of here.

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,408
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:34,368
I need to get this out of here.

9
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,244
Huh?

10
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,121
Load it onto the truck!

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,414
Quickly!

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:58,267
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,398
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

14
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:10,780
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

15
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:17,495
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

16
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:23,667
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

17
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:31,342
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

18
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,637
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

19
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,681
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:43,604
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

21
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:49,235
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,030
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

23
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:59,787
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

24
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:05,876
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

25
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,843
The Grail War is in grave peril.

26
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:18,013
We have identified
Caster's Master...

27
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,559
...as the person behind the recent
kidnappings in Fuyuki.

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:27,314
Thus, in accordance with my
emergency powers as overseer,

29
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,067
...I am temporarily altering
the rules of the Grail War.

30
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:35,072
All Masters are to cease
any ongoing combat,

31
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,409
...and eliminate Caster instead.

32
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:42,621
And the one who defeats
Caster and his Master...

33
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,083
...will receive an additional
Command Seal as their reward.

34
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:52,882
These are unused Command Seals left by
the fallen Masters of past Grail Wars.

35
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:58,012
They should prove to be of
immeasurable value to all of you.

36
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,765
Once Caster's destruction
has been confirmed,

37
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:05,603
...the Holy Grail War
will recommence.

38
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:10,232
If anyone has questions,
please ask them here.

39
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,988
Of course, that is limited to those
who can speak in human tongues.

40
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,744
Well played, Father.

41
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,081
Now the Masters will
all hunt him down.

42
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,002
Five familiars were gathered
at the church.

43
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,128
Which means...

44
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:37,509
Which means that the missing
Lord El-Melloi is still alive.

45
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,802
Indeed.

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,139
And the offer of a Command Seal
as the reward...

47
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:46,227
...should draw him out,
given that he's already used one.

48
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,563
And the other Masters, as well.

49
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,399
They'll seek to keep it from the rest...

50
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,445
...by claiming it for themselves.

51
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,658
But it also means that
the Master who wins the Seal...

52
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,410
...will gain a formidable advantage.

53
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,663
Naturally, it isn't an ideal solution.

54
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:11,669
Once Caster has been weakened
and is on the run from the others,

55
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:16,298
...Archer must be the one
to deal the final blow.

56
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,134
U-Um...

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,138
Is this the MacKenzie residence?

58
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:27,518
Just so. That is the name of
this domicile's residents.

59
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:28,978
Well, then...

60
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,648
Might there be a Mr. Iskandar,
King of Conquerors here?

61
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,149
That would be me.

62
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,069
Oh... I see.

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,865
Could I have your signature
on the receipt?

64
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,326
My signature?
Very well!

65
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,831
You have my thanks.

66
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,584
Th-Thank you for your business...

67
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,131
Conquest

68
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:02,303
What a feeling, to have the entire world
emblazoned across my chest!

69
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,432
Why are you dressed like that?

70
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,225
My package just arrived.

71
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,394
You went outside?

72
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,687
Ta-dah!

73
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,606
I merely tried out that
"mail order" thing.

74
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,693
I told you not to leave
the second floor!

75
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,489
If the residents are not at home
and you are occupied with your familiar,

76
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,658
...who else is there
to answer the door?

77
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,493
I had no choice...

78
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,913
A summons by the Holy Church
is a big deal.

79
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,957
Don't be so grouchy.

80
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,711
After seeing Saber last night,
I came to a realization.

81
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,213
If one wears modern attire,

82
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,051
...there should be no issue
with going outside.

83
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,511
Hey, wait!

84
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,805
At least put on some pants
before you go out!

85
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,683
Oh, leggings"-

86
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,729
That's true.
Everyone in this land wears them.

87
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,731
Must I?

88
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,399
Yes, you must!

89
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,401
And just to be clear,

90
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:05,699
...I'm definitely not going all the way
to town just to buy you XXXL pants.

91
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,909
What?

92
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:11,121
Boy, would you stand in the way
of my triumphant conquest?

93
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,916
Conquest and your pants
have nothing,

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,668
...not even in the slightest,
to do with each other!

95
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,546
Before you start planning to
screw around outside,

96
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,674
...go beat one of
the other Servants!

97
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,260
Then I'll buy you pants,
or anything else you want.

98
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,222
I understand. Very well.

99
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,726
Then you swear that
once I defeat an enemy,

100
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,687
...you will buy me pants?

101
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,481
You...

102
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,443
You really want to wear modern clothes
and go outside that much?

103
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,279
The King of Knights was doing it.

104
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,408
As a fellow king, I cannot
allow myself to be outdone.

105
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,660
I like the design on this shirt.

106
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,204
It is fitting attire for a ruler!

107
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,916
And we have to find Caster, too...

108
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,127
What are you doing?

109
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,258
There is a powerful barrier over Mt. Enzou,
with Ryudou Temple at its center.

110
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,970
Because of that, anything other than
natural spirits like Servants...

111
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,305
...can only enter
via the temple path.

112
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,475
Keep that in mind
as you're using Saber.

113
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,812
There are three other spots
where the leylines converge.

114
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,106
Tohsaka Manor
and the Fuyuki Chapel. And...

115
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,776
...this new residential area
east of the city center.

116
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:27,990
Consequently, this means that there
are four locations in Fuyuki...

117
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,993
...that have all the spiritual characteristics
needed for the Grail to appear.

118
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,789
When the war enters its second phase
and there are fewer Servants left,

119
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,877
...we'll have to secure one of these
as a base of operations, won't we?

120
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,336
That's right.

121
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,382
That covers the lay of the land.
Do you have any questions?

122
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,260
Is there anything that you
aren't clear on?

123
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,347
It was a perfectly
adequate explanation.

124
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,187
Kiritsugu, can we assume that
all the others will go after Caster?

125
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,022
It's a safe bet...

126
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,109
However, we have an advantage
as far as Caster is concerned.

127
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,320
Out of whatever madness,

128
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,990
...he believes Saber
to be his Jeanne d'Arc,

129
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,366
...which is to our benefit.

130
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,911
We need only wait for him
to come to us.

131
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,916
Master, that is not enough.
His evil deeds must be punished.

132
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,628
We should take the fight to him
before he can do any more damage.

133
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,594
Iri, do you have a handle on
this forest's barrier spells?

134
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,095
Yes. That's fine...

135
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:36,058
But our real problem is
the curse on Saber's left hand.

136
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,729
Eighteen hours have passed
since your defeat of Kayneth,

137
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,566
...but Saber's wound hasn't healed.

138
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,444
Lancer must still live.

139
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,906
Shouldn't we defeat Lancer first,

140
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,075
...so we can face Caster
at full strength?

141
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,910
That isn't necessary.

142
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,997
You just need to use
your knowledge of the area...

143
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,333
...to confuse the enemy,
keeping Saber away from him.

144
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,545
You won't have her
fight Caster?

145
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,839
Someone else will deal with him
even if we don't.

146
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,678
The ones hunting Caster in a frenzy
will make for better targets.

147
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,682
I'll attack from their flanks
and take them out.

148
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,685
Master, you are...

149
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,980
To what depths
do you intend to sink?!

150
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,856
You do an insult
to Heroic Spirits.

151
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,568
Why do you not allow me to fight?

152
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:32,114
Do you mean to imply that you cannot
trust me, your own Servant?!

153
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,118
There's a truce against
everyone but Caster, isn't there?

154
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:37,786
It will be fine.

155
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,164
This overseer of ours
can't be trusted.

156
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,794
He harbors Assassin's Master,
and doesn't say anything about it.

157
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,171
He may also be working
with Tohsaka.

158
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,632
We should be skeptical
of anything he does.

159
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,844
All right. Dismissed.

160
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,767
Kiritsugu...

161
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,564
If...

162
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,483
If I...

163
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,988
If I decided to abandon
everything and run away...

164
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,825
Iri, would you come with me?

165
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,244
What about Ilya?

166
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,705
She's still at our castle!

167
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,582
I'd return for her,

168
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,500
...killing anyone in our way.

169
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,044
And then...

170
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,049
I'd give all I have for you and Ilya!
And for no other!

171
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,552
Could we get away?

172
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,180
We could escape!
If we go now, it's not too late!

173
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,516
You're lying.

174
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,851
That's a lie.

175
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,938
You could never run away.

176
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:51,568
You'd never forgive yourself
for abandoning the Grail.

177
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,987
For failing to save the world.

178
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,909
As your first and final accuser,

179
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,287
...you would kill yourself.

180
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,374
I'm scared.

181
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,126
He...

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,213
Kirei Kotomine is after me.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,090
Maiya told me.

184
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,635
He used Kayneth as bait
to draw me out.

185
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,553
He anticipated my actions.

186
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,015
I've already sacrificed you
to this conflict,

187
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,059
...and I've had to leave Ilya behind.

188
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,771
But the most dangerous of them all
has set his sights on me already.

189
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,857
The one that I'd hoped to never
cross paths with!

190
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,071
I won't allow you to fight alone.

191
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,783
I'll protect you.
Saber will protect you.

192
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,911
And... Maiya is here, as well.

193
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:47,958
Kiritsugu?

194
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,002
An enemy attack?

195
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,297
It's lucky that I hadn't
sent out Maiya yet.

196
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,426
We can mount
an all-out defense.

197
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,765
Iri, find a remote-viewing crystal ball.

198
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,189
There they are.

199
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,527
Irisviel, the enemy
is trying to lure us out.

200
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,697
Those must be hostages.

201
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,992
I'll have to go down and save them.

202
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,789
He knows we're watching!

203
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,292
As promised last night,

204
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,712
...I, Gilles De Rais,
have come for you.

205
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:39,634
I wish to see you, Jeanne.
My beautiful Holy Virgin...

206
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,802
Irisviel...

207
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,638
You may take your time if you wish.

208
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:49,436
I have come prepared
for a lengthy wait.

209
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,733
Now, children, it's time
to play hide-and-seek.

210
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,278
The rules are simple.
You need only elude me.

211
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,071
But if I find you...

212
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,823
Don't!

213
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,874
Run, children! When I count to
one hundred, the chase begins.

214
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,334
Well, Jeanne?

215
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,505
How long do you think
it will take me to catch them all?

216
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,928
Saber, defeat Caster!

217
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,137
I shall!

218
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,747
Welcome, Jeanne.

219
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,334
How do you like this horrible sight?

220
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,253
It pains you, does it not?

221
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,757
Do you despise me?

222
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,052
Yes, I'm sure you must.

223
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,682
I'm sure you'll never forgive me
for turning from God's love.

224
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,393
Unhand the child, monster!

225
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,815
Jeanne, if you so dearly wish
to save the boy...

226
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,819
Rejoice, child.

227
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:25,740
God's devout messenger
says that she will save you.

228
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,247
It's dangerous here.

229
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,916
Now, run away.

230
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,086
Follow this path, and you'll
come to a large castle.

231
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,147
Do you not remember?

232
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,818
I said that when next we met,
I would be prepared.

233
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,446
Very well...

234
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,450
My fight with you is no longer
over the Grail!

235
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,127
Oh, Jeanne...

236
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,838
How noble! How beautiful!

237
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,884
Holy Virgin,
even God's beauty pales before you!

238
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,805
Caster! I take up my sword
to destroy you!

239
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,662
<i>If only I could use my left hand...</i>

240
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,791
Even Caster's mana isn't infinite.

241
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,669
If she can last until it runs out,

242
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,171
...Saber can win, right?

243
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,214
Kiritsugu?

244
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:09,052
More importantly, is there still no sign of
the other Masters entering the forest?

245
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,512
Maiya.

246
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,139
Take Iri and flee the castle.

247
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,184
Head in the opposite direction
as Saber and Caster.

248
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,062
I can't stay here?

249
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,941
With Saber fighting away from you,
it isn't safe.

250
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,195
One of the others is sure to
have had the same idea.

251
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,281
All right.

252
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,703
What's wrong, Iri?

253
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,623
It appears another has arrived.

254
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,170
HOW?

255
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,673
Is there no end to his mana?

256
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,925
<i>Impossible.</i>

257
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,802
<i>The source of his mana is...</i>

258
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,596
So that book is your Noble Phantasm?

259
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,435
Just so. The grimoire left me
by my teacher Prélati...

260
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,731
...gives me the means to
command a demonic legion.

261
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,524
What do you think, Jeanne?

262
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,943
It brings back memories,
right, Jeanne?

263
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,237
Everything is just as it was then.

264
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,115
Your indomitable Warrior's spirit
and noble bearing...

265
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,326
...prove you to be
none other than Jeanne d'Arc!

266
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,620
So why?

267
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,956
Why do you not awaken?

268
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,751
Do you still believe in
God's grace even now?

269
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,380
Even when faced with mortal peril, you
still believe a miracle will save you?

270
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,468
How tragic... Have you forgotten
the Battle of Compiegne?

271
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:37,640
Even after enduring that humiliation,
you still remain God's puppet?

272
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,160
Pathetic, Saber.

273
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,705
Such swordsmanship is
unworthy of the title King of Knights.

274
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,292
Who are you?

275
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,670
Who gave you leave to
interfere with us?

276
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,298
That is my question, monster.

277
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,843
It will be my lance
that takes Saber's life!

278
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,763
It was my prayer!

279
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,141
It was my Holy Grail
that brought her back to life!

280
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,310
She is mine...

281
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:26,940
Every scrap of flesh, every drop of blood,
even her very soul is mine!

282
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,733
Hey, Caster.

283
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,654
I won't comment on your
notion of romance.

284
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:38,034
If you say you're going to make
Saber yours, then try it.

285
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,202
But know this...

286
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,162
I, Diarmuid,
will not allow you...

287
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:45,458
...to defeat a crippled Saber
before I can!

288
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,087
Lancer, you...

289
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,339
Don't get the wrong idea, Saber.

290
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:56,219
The only thing that brought me here today
was the order to defeat Caster.

291
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,223
To that end, I believe cooperation
to be our best option here.

292
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,182
What do you think?

293
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,062
Just to be clear, Lancer,

294
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,275
...I could kill a hundred of
those things with just the one arm.

295
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,778
A mere hundred
is child's play.

296
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,449
You'll pay for this...

297
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,869
Don't get any ideas,
you savage!

298
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,708
<i>Fervor Mei Sanguis.</i>

299
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:40,263
Kayneth El-Melloi,
ninth Archibald family head, is here.

300
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:46,895
Mage of the Einzbern, let us duel
for the Grail with our lives and our honor!

301
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,428
Mechanical traps, of all things...

302
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,306
Have you fallen so low, Einzbern?

303
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,685
Very well. Then this is no longer
a duel, but an extermination.

304
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,032
I see... Automated probes.

305
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,625
Found you, rat.

306
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,714
<i>Sculp!</i>

307
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,885
<i>Time Alter: Double Accelerate!</i>

308
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:15,400
He manipulated time to accelerate himself
by using his own body as a Reality Marble...

309
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,861
It seems that he knows
a little magic after all.

310
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,493
Still, only a coward would rely on
petty tricks after being trained as a mage.

311
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,162
Perhaps dying
will teach him his place.

312
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,958
<i>Ire Sanctio!</i>

313
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,882
If he's manipulating his inner time, it must
be placing enormous stress on his body.

314
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,887
I've found him.

315
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:49,017
Now then, how far can you run,
as exhausted as you are?

316
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,487
<i>Time Alter: Triple Stagnate.</i>

317
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,372
<i>These things don't have eyes.</i>

318
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,792
<i>If I slow my internal time
to a third,</i>

319
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,463
<i>...and lower my pulse and respiration
as far as they can go,</i>

320
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,132
<i>...they can't sense me.</i>

321
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,688
Kayneth!

322
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,735
You fool!
You're wasting your time!

323
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,495
Episode 7:
Dark Forest

324
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:58,711
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

325
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:07,512
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

326
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:22,527
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

327
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:30,785
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

328
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:39,877
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

329
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:46,259
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

330
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:54,892
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

331
00:23:55,017 --> 00:24:01,816
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

332
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:09,907
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

333
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:18,332
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

334
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,753
Maiya, no!

335
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,047
I've shamed myself as a mage!

336
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,842
Tremble... Despair.

337
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,927
Strike! Gae Dearg!

338
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,055
By whose order
did you engage in battle?

339
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,516
You're ready. Right, monster?
