00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,598
Germany, Einzbern Castle
— Eight Years Ago —

2
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,017
Master Kiritsugu!

3
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,522
Your child is born!

4
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,944
She's so cute.

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,241
So small, so delicate...

6
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,455
Look, Kiritsugu.
She has your eyes.

7
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:46,088
I'm so glad that
she was born.

8
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,220
Iri.

9
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:59,602
I will be the cause
of your death.

10
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,985
I know.

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:13,282
The Einzberns have dreamed of this day.
It is the very reason I exist.

12
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:18,579
When I came to know your ideals,
I made your wish my own.

13
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,998
You made me
who I am today.

14
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,627
You have guided me.

15
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,005
You offered me a better life
than that of a simple puppet.

16
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:34,720
You needn't pity me.
I'm a part of you now.

17
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,972
- So...
- I...

18
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:46,649
I have no right
to hold that child.

19
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,030
Kiritsugu, do not forget.

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,076
You're striving to make a world where
no one needs to cry that way.

21
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:02,206
That is the ideal
of Kiritsugu Emiya.

22
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,003
Eight more years, and your fight
will come to an end.

23
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,007
And our ideal
will become reality.

24
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,720
The Holy Grail will save you.
I'm certain of it.

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,393
So take this child, Illyasviel,
and hold her.

26
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:29,024
And be proud,
like any other father.

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,560
Torino, Italy
— Three Years Ago —

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,561
Torino, Italy - Three Years Ago
A command seal?

29
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,230
Yes, the mark that appeared
on your right hand.

30
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,483
It identifies you as a participant
in the Holy Grail War.

31
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,820
A stigmata, bestowing upon you
the power to command a Servant.

32
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,115
Kirei Kotomine.

33
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,702
The Holy Grail War.

34
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,914
The battle for a relic
that performs miracles.

35
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,208
I have been chosen?

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:34,256
Normally, those chosen by the Grail as
Masters for the Servants are all mages.

37
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,717
It's highly unusual
for someone like you,

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,639
...with no connection to magic,
to be chosen so early on.

39
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,682
Servants...

40
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,936
I still find it strange to command
the summoned spirits...

41
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,396
...of ancient heroes
to fight as familiars.

42
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,525
I know it's hard
to believe.

43
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,571
Heroes from every age and nation will
come back to life in the modern world,

44
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,740
...killing one another
to vie for supremacy.

45
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,702
That is the Holy Grail War.

46
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,373
Naturally, there is an unspoken agreement
among all involved parties...

47
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,999
...to conduct the battles
in secret.

48
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:14,713
To ensure that this rule is upheld, we of
the Holy Church send an observer.

49
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,675
Can one of us really act
as a judge...

50
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,511
...in a battle between
magicians?

51
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,305
A Mages Association member...

52
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,850
...would be too partial to one party
to assure fairness.

53
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,772
And thus, as he did
sixty years ago,

54
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,234
...we will have your father
watch over our battle.

55
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,861
My father will be
coming to Fuyuki?

56
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,116
But wouldn't it pose
a problem...

57
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,287
...for the overseer's child
to be a participant?

58
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,413
Tokiomi.

59
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,708
Let's get to the point.

60
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:58,716
Kirei, everything we've spoken of
thus far is known to all participants.

61
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,884
But there is an
additional reason...

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,972
...I've asked you and
Tokiomi Tohsaka here today.

63
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,890
And what would
that be?

64
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,227
Actually, we found proof long ago
that the Holy Grail that will appear...

65
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:16,108
...in Fuyuki is not the sacred relic
that belonged to the Son of God.

66
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,526
So I gathered.

67
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,529
Otherwise, an order to retrieve it
would have been given...

68
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,032
...to us of the Eighth
Sacrament Assembly.

69
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:27,911
Be that as it may, Fuyuki's Holy Grail
is too powerful to ignore.

70
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,581
It is an omnipotent
wish-granting device.

71
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,833
Who knows what disaster
it could unleash,

72
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,169
...should it fall into
the wrong hands.

73
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,549
In which case, the next best course
of action would be to ensure...

74
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,928
...that the Fuyuki Grail at least
falls into the right hands.

75
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,724
The Tohsakas are
a family of mages,

76
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,935
...but mages with a long history
of friendship with the Church.

77
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,273
We know what kind
of person Tokiomi is.

78
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,527
And more than anything, their intentions
for the Grail are plain.

79
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,863
To reach the Root.

80
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,200
That is the Tohsaka family's
sole desire.

81
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,663
But the Einzberns and Matous
have both forgotten...

82
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,416
...the wish we once shared
with them.

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,421
The other Masters
go without saying.

84
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:25,010
Who knows what dark plans
they may harbor for the Grail.

85
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,140
Then the goal of my participation
is ensuring...

86
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,602
...Tokiomi Tohsaka's victory.

87
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,858
Of course, we will maintain
the appearance of enemies.

88
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,696
But in secret,
we will work together...

89
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:50,702
...to defeat the other five Masters
and assure our victory.

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,497
To that end, Kirei,

91
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:58,669
...you will be transferred from the
Church to the Mages Association,

92
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,838
...where you will
become my student.

93
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,298
The official orders have
already been issued.

94
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,844
You must go to Japan
and study magic,

95
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,389
...and become a mage
of sufficient strength...

96
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:15,853
...to command a Servant in the
Holy Grail War in three years' time.

97
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:20,941
Now then...

98
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,735
Any questions, Kirei?

99
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,028
Only one.

100
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,744
What is the Grail's criteria
when it selects its Masters?

101
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,712
The Grail gives precedence to
those Masters who need it most.

102
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,632
So all the Masters have a reason
to covet the Grail?

103
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,551
Not necessarily.

104
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm told that in the past, there were cases
in which command seals appeared...

105
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,057
...on those whom you would never
have expected to be chosen.

106
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,602
I see.

107
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:01,773
Kirei, are you still upset
over being chosen?

108
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,197
I didn't expect him to give
his consent so quickly.

109
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:13,202
My son would jump into a fire
if the Church ordered it.

110
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,163
To be honest,
I'm almost disappointed.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,753
From his perspective, he's been drawn into
a war that has nothing to do with him.

112
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:28,050
No, perhaps this will
do him some good.

113
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,096
Only a few days ago,
he lost his wife.

114
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,642
A change of scenery
and a new mission...

115
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,647
...may be exactly what he needs
to nurse his wounds.

116
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:50,906
Fuyuki City, Japan
— One Year Ago —

117
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,325
Aoi.

118
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,668
Kariya, it's good to see you again.
You're back from your business trip?

119
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,462
This one took
a long time.

120
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,798
Yeah, I guess
it did.

121
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,800
Uncle Kariya!

122
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,971
Uncle Kariya, welcome back!

123
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,514
Rin.

124
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,809
Did you bring me
a present again?

125
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,728
Rin! Don't be rude!

126
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,523
Here you go.

127
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,529
Thanks, Uncle!

128
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,615
I'm glad you like it.

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,370
Where's Sakura?

130
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,751
Sakura's gone now.

131
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,215
<i>Aoi?</i>

132
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:56,013
You see, Sakura is no longer
my daughter or Rin's little sister.

133
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,768
She's been sent to join
the Matou family.

134
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,313
Why?

135
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,151
You know better than anyone why
the Matous would want children...

136
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,904
...who carry the blood
of mages.

137
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,620
The Tohsaka family elders decided
to give our ancient allies,

138
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,539
...the Matous, that which
they requested.

139
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,042
It wasn't my place
to speak out.

140
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,128
You're all right
with that?

141
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:34,593
When I married into the Tohsaka family,
when I decided to marry a mage,

142
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,970
...I knew what might
be required of me.

143
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,847
And you're all right
with that?!

144
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,642
A clan bearing
mage blood...

145
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,812
...can never expect the happiness
of a normal family.

146
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,022
That's not true!

147
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,858
When you married him,
you wanted happiness-

148
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,737
This is between the Tohsakas
and the Matous.

149
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,615
You left the world
of mages.

150
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,117
It doesn't concern you.

151
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,668
If you ever see Sakura,
be kind to her.

152
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,589
She was always
fond of you.

153
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,429
So, the failure had the nerve
to show his face here.

154
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:27,729
I told you to never
darken my doorstep again,

155
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,106
...Kariya.

156
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,817
I heard you adopted the Tohsakas'
second daughter.

157
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,736
You have sharp ears.

158
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:39,991
Is it that important to keep mages
in the Matou lineage?

159
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,787
Would you tell me we're wrong to?
You, of all people?

160
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:48,583
Whose fault do you think our present
reduced circumstances are?

161
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,210
Kariya.

162
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:58,385
Had you agreed to carry on the family name
and learn the secrets of the Matou,

163
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,554
...things wouldn't be
this bad.

164
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,848
You're not fooling anyone,
you vampire.

165
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:08,770
You only want the Grail
to give yourself eternal youth.

166
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,443
Next year, sixty years
will have passed.

167
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:19,614
But the Matous have no pawns to offer
for the Fourth Holy Grail War.

168
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:25,537
Though you have it, your brother Byakuya
lacks the power to control a Servant.

169
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:31,835
But even if we forfeit this round,
we could still win the next in 60 years.

170
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:37,841
The Tohsaka girl's womb
will bear us a powerful mage.

171
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,928
She has a lot of potential,
that one.

172
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:48,727
So, as long as you get the Grail,
you don't need Sakura Tohsaka.

173
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,856
What are you scheming?

174
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,358
A trade, Zouken.

175
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,738
I'll return from the next war,
Grail in hand.

176
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,992
And in return,
you will release her.

177
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,703
Don't be stupid.

178
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,832
You're a failure, and you haven't
trained a day in your life.

179
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,337
In a single year, you'll achieve
the power to control a Servant?

180
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,257
You have the magic to make
that happen, and you know it.

181
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,052
With your special worm techniques.

182
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,683
Implant me
with Crest Worms.

183
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,187
Kariya, do you want
to kill yourself?

184
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,232
The Matous should rely on themselves
to gain what they want.

185
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,776
I won't let anyone else
get involved.

186
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,156
Surely you're not concerned
for my wellbeing, Father.

187
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,080
If you're trying to keep her
out of this, Kariya,

188
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,042
...you're a little late.

189
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,878
You old bastard,
you didn't!

190
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:05,470
For the first three days,
she screamed her head off.

191
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,641
But on the fourth,
she stopped.

192
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:16,231
This morning, I threw her into the
worm pit to see how long she'd last.

193
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:20,777
It's been twelve hours,
and she's still breathing.

194
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:25,073
The Tohsakas
are very powerful.

195
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,283
Sakura!

196
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,243
Well, what will you
do now?

197
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,499
A single broken girl, violated
by worms from head to toe.

198
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,502
If you still wish to save her,

199
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,463
...I might think about it.

200
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,715
I agree.

201
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:50,140
But I shall continue her education
until you show results.

202
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,853
I still expect victory to come
in the war after this one.

203
00:14:54,978 --> 00:15:00,317
But should you somehow manage
to retrieve the Grail, all the better.

204
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,612
Naturally, I'll no longer need
the girl in that case.

205
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:08,909
Her education will
only last a year.

206
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,787
You won't renege on your word.
Right, Zouken Matou?

207
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,625
Start by serving as their
breeding ground for a week.

208
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,881
If you don't die or go insane,
then I'll concede that you're serious.

209
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,642
It's finally here.

210
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,895
What does it say?

211
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,982
It's a report from the spies I sent
to the London Clock Tower.

212
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,403
It says the Grail chose a Master
from within the Clock Tower,

213
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,989
...the highest authority within
the Mages Association.

214
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,240
Who?

215
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,659
A man who will be a problem.

216
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,662
The eldest son of the famous
Archibald family,

217
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,872
...which has produced
nine generations of mages.

218
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,667
Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald.

219
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,962
London Clock Tower
— Present Day —

220
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:07,968
London Clock Tower - Present Day
In the world of mages,
lineage is everything.

221
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,181
This is because magic will not yield up
her secrets in a single generation.

222
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:18,561
A parent passes on the fruits of
a lifetime of training to his child.

223
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:23,316
Thus, the older the family of mages,
the greater their power.

224
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,821
You are no doubt wondering why I am
beginning with something so basic.

225
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:32,909
It is because a student submitted
this paper to me yesterday.

226
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,914
The paper is entitled "How Wizardry
Should Be in the New Century."

227
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,919
It objects to the traditions
I just spoke of.

228
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,423
It claims that if one were to
achieve a deep understanding...

229
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,843
...of the techniques and precise
control over mana application,

230
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,097
...it would allow one to overcome
any difference in inherent ability.

231
00:16:54,222 --> 00:17:00,395
In short, even someone with diluted
blood could become a master mage.

232
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,982
To be honest, I've learned something
from reading this.

233
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,650
Silence, please.

234
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:13,116
I will be frank. This paper is
nothing but juvenile fantasies.

235
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,954
Blood determines
a mage's power.

236
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,999
This is hard,
unchanging reality.

237
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,711
Waver Velvet.

238
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,465
I am very, very disappointed
that one of my students...

239
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,300
...would indulge
in this nonsense.

240
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,595
Sir, I was only trying to raise a
question the Mages Association...

241
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,680
...has become too reluctant
to address--

242
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,223
Waver.

243
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:43,188
As I recall, your family has produced
mages for only three generations.

244
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,273
Listen to me.

245
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:51,321
Compared to the Mages Association's
history, your family is a newborn baby.

246
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,992
Shouldn't a baby learn to speak
before it tries to voice an opinion?

247
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,163
He made a fool of me!
He made a fool of me!

248
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,498
He made a fool of me!

249
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,666
Is that any way for
a teacher to act?!

250
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,671
Reading my paper made
him jealous! He's afraid of my talent!

251
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,216
That's why he embarrassed me
in front of everyone!

252
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,679
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

253
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,972
I'm fine.

254
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,019
You're in the Department of Spiritual
Evocation, right? Why aren't you in class?

255
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,687
Well...

256
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,399
Mr. Archibald asked me
to run an errand for him.

257
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,193
That's why I was in a hurry.

258
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,029
I see. That's great.

259
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,032
Would you give this to him?

260
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,702
This?

261
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,081
Make sure he gets it.
It's supposed to be important.

262
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:44,999
Important?

263
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:49,629
Package origin...
Macedonia?

264
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,012
This is it!

265
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,058
Those rumors that Kayneth
will be fighting...

266
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,604
...in some kind of mages' tournament
in the Far East soon were true.

267
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,902
The Holy Grail War.

268
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,323
Two hundred years ago, the Einzberns,
Makiris, and Tohsakas,

269
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,493
...collectively known as
the Three First Families,

270
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:28,126
...worked together to summon the Holy Grail,
said to have the power to grant any wish.

271
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:34,632
But the Holy Grail would grant
only one supplication.

272
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:40,054
Their cooperation
turned to bloody war.

273
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,057
That was the beginning
of the Holy Grail Wars.

274
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,061
Ever since then,
once every sixty years,

275
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,439
...the Holy Grail appears
in the city of Fuyuki.

276
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:54,319
It selects seven mages with the right
to hold it and grants them the power...

277
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,616
...to summon the powerful Heroic Spirits
known as Servants.

278
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,037
Archer. Saber.
Lancer.

279
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,372
Rider.
Assassin.

280
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,583
Caster.
Berserker.

281
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,338
Divided into these seven classes,
Servants fight to the death...

282
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:20,011
...to determine who is worthy
to win the Grail.

283
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,561
So this Holy Grail War is
a battle of pure strength,

284
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,814
...where titles and influence
mean nothing.

285
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,652
It's the perfect place
for me.

286
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,781
Furthermore, in order to
summon a Servant,

287
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,660
...a relic of theirs is needed
to act as a catalyst.

288
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,912
A relic...

289
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,612
No matter how often I see it, this device
still strikes me as indecent.

290
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,990
I have a report from
the Clock Tower.

291
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,868
Lord El-Melloi has acquired
another relic.

292
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,622
His participation
is certain now.

293
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,835
It troubles me that two slots
are still unaccounted for.

294
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,003
Don't worry.

295
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,756
When the time comes, the Grail will
select seven, regardless of skill.

296
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,843
The ones it rounds out the group with
are nearly always weak.

297
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,388
Don't concern yourself
with them.

298
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,599
Speaking of matters
of concern, Kirei,

299
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,061
...no one saw you enter
the mansion, I trust?

300
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,604
Don't worry.

301
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:59,736
No familiars or magical devices, visible
or invisible, are watching this mansion.

302
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,239
- On that, you have--
- You have my guarantee.

303
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,743
No matter what tricks
they use,

304
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:11,831
...no one can deceive the eyes
of Hassan, the spy Heroic Spirit.

305
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,794
There is no trace of anyone
following my Master.

306
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,631
Please put your minds
at ease.

307
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:26,429
If a Servant has manifested,
my father is sure to know.

308
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,768
The other mages will not take action
for a while longer.

309
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,145
Assassin, you may go.

310
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,647
Continue guarding the
surrounding area.

311
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,648
As you wish.

312
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,986
But it's only a matter of time.

313
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:49,285
Before long, this place will be swarming
with familiars sent by the other Masters.

314
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,289
- What is that?
- Another investigation.

315
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,002
I have been gathering information
on the Einzbern Master.

316
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,631
Nine years ago,
the Einzberns,

317
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,926
...a family notoriously proud
of their pure blood,

318
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,763
...suddenly allowed an outsider mage
to marry into the family.

319
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,977
The Einzbern mages have devoted
themselves solely to alchemy,

320
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,813
...rendering them unfit
for combat.

321
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:21,526
Their losses in previous Holy Grail Wars
can all be traced to that fact.

322
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,612
They must have run out
of patience.

323
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,367
The man they chose
was perfect for their needs.

324
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,080
Kiritsugu Emiya.

325
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,000
The man known as
the Mage-Killer.

326
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:49,804
We've finally found the relic we've been
searching for in Cornwall all these years.

327
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,849
If you use it as a catalyst,
you'll be able to summon...

328
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:57,520
...what is likely the strongest
of the sword-wielding Servants.

329
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,105
Kiritsugu.

330
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:04,819
This is the greatest gift
the Einzbern can offer.

331
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,155
I am honored, Elder.

332
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,825
This time, there are to be
no survivors.

333
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,703
Hunt down the six
other Servants,

334
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,832
...and fulfill the Third Magic,
"Heaven's Feel."

335
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,125
Understood.

336
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:25,840
Kiritsugu Emiya?
I know that name.

337
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,802
So even the Church
has heard of him?

338
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:35,349
Emiya the Mage-Killer
was quite infamous in his time.

339
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,562
On the surface, he was a rogue mage
who didn't belong to the Association.

340
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,567
But the higher-ups found him quite
convenient for their own purposes.

341
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:49,655
Similar to us Executors
of the Holy Church?

342
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,407
Far worse.

343
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:57,788
Essentially, he's a freelance assassin
who specializes in killing mages.

344
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,333
He knows what mages
are capable of,

345
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,961
...so he deals with them in the way
most unlike a mage possible.

346
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,797
Read this.

347
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:13,095
Sniping. Poisoning.
Bombs in public places.

348
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,100
He once brought down an entire jetliner
just because his target was on it.

349
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,021
A man who will do anything
without a second thought.

350
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:28,069
It is because the world's laws
do not apply to mages...

351
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,822
...that we must carefully obey
the laws we set for ourselves.

352
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:37,578
But this man lacks any trace
of a mage's pride.

353
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,831
These methods he employs
are unforgivable.

354
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:50,800
Then what does this Kiritsugu Emiya
gain by hiring himself out as a killer?

355
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,302
Money, I would imagine.

356
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,763
As you can read
in that report,

357
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,976
...he's been involved in more
than just mage assassinations.

358
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,479
He's appeared in war zones
all over the planet,

359
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,399
...offering his services
as a mercenary.

360
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,988
May I borrow this report
for a while?

361
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,496
Let's go over
what we know, Iri.

362
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,752
Of the seven masters the Grail
will choose, we have identified four.

363
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,673
Tokiomi Tohsaka,
Tohsaka family head.

364
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,468
Fire mage. Uses Jewel Magic.
Very formidable.

365
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,012
Kariya Matou.

366
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:41,851
So they took the kid who left the family
and made him a Master, huh?

367
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,936
That old man
must be desperate.

368
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,689
Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald.

369
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,442
Wind and water affinity.

370
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:54,030
Expert in Necromancy,
Summoning, and Alchemy.

371
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,991
- And...
- Kiritsugu Emiya.

372
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,328
Newest member of the Einzbern family,
and their trump card.

373
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,039
The man I love.

374
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:13,716
And the fourth... No, fifth, is
Kirei Kotomine, sent by the Church.

375
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,801
By the Church?

376
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,764
He's the son of the overseer,
Father Risei Kotomine.

377
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:25,102
Reports say he studied under Tokiomi
Tohsaka starting three years ago,

378
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,313
...splitting with him after his
command seal appeared.

379
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,023
Did something happen?

380
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,233
It has his personal
history here...

381
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,819
Read it.

382
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,822
"Kirei Kotomine.

383
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,868
Followed his father on
pilgrimages since childhood.

384
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,121
Graduated from the Saint Ignatius
School of Divinity in Manresa.

385
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,541
Skipped two years,
graduating as Valedictorian."

386
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,335
He sounds
pretty impressive.

387
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,421
But he suddenly leaves
the primrose path...

388
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,632
...and volunteers for
the Holy Church.

389
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:59,637
Why would someone like that go to work
for a secret Church organization?

390
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,722
Maybe because
of his father?

391
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:07,353
It says here that he's a member of the
Church's Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

392
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:10,898
Then he would have pursued
that path from the start.

393
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,485
But until he arrived at the
same place as his father,

394
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,862
...he changed positions
three times.

395
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,074
He was even
an Executor once.

396
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,951
An Executor?

397
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,912
A heretic hunter.

398
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,499
In essence...
Exactly what I once was.

399
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,668
A mage-killer.

400
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,337
Kiritsugu Emiya...

401
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:38,801
His assassinations were always carried
out in clusters over a short period.

402
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:42,346
During the same general time periods,
he appeared in war zones,

403
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,684
...but only when the combat
was at its fiercest.

404
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:52,356
As if he had some obsession
with chasing his own death.

405
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,859
These are clearly the actions
of a man bent on suicide.

406
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,613
What does this mean?

407
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,993
Alchemy, Necromancy, Summoning,
Divination, Healing.

408
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,038
Look at all the categories
of magic he's studied.

409
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,583
Why so many?

410
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,586
He gets almost to the point
of mastery,

411
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,590
...then switches to another type
and never looks back.

412
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:22,803
It's as if he throws away everything
he's learned like yesterday's trash.

413
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:24,805
Iri.

414
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,560
This Kirei Kotomine
terrifies me.

415
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,354
He has no concept
of self-interest.

416
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,568
His actions are completely disconnected
from any thought of risk versus reward.

417
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:42,031
There's no way he's just a freelancer,
in it for the money.

418
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,993
The man has never experienced
passion in his entire life.

419
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,662
He believes in nothing.

420
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,958
He has no wish of any kind
to be granted.

421
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,419
For a man like that...

422
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,589
Then what is he after?

423
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,426
Why would he risk his life
for the Grail?

424
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:07,890
But the Grail chose Kirei Kotomine
as one of its Masters.

425
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:08,891
That's right.

426
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,771
He must have some reason
to want the Grail.

427
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,733
But I can't even begin
to imagine what it is.

428
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,611
And that terrifies me.

429
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,031
<i>Kirei Kotomine.</i>

430
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,492
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya.</i>

431
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:33,833
<i>His endless string of battles came
to a sudden halt nine years ago.</i>

432
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,545
<i>His encounter with the
mages of the North,</i>

433
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:42,091
<i>...the Einzberns, is where
he found his answer.</i>

434
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:47,429
<i>So I must ask the question...
What did he seek in those battles?</i>

435
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,433
<i>And what, exactly,
did he find?</i>

436
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,572
You just barely made it.

437
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:11,453
If the Grail's chosen you, that means
you've made some progress as a mage.

438
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,790
I'll give you
that much, Kariya.

439
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:20,671
But you look
like hell.

440
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,550
Does your left leg
still work?

441
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,685
Don't get mad.

442
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,774
If you get the Crest Worms inside you
worked up, they'll devour you.

443
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:47,823
Either way, I'd give you
a month at best.

444
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,199
That's plenty.

445
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,743
What?

446
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,495
I said that's plenty
of time.

447
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,583
Kariya, this is your present
for surviving an entire year.

448
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:01,629
I found the perfect relic
for you.

449
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,716
Don't let your father's kindness
go to waste.

450
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,397
I've got a command seal, too!

451
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,775
The Grail chose me!

452
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,028
The Grail recognized
my talent!

453
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,240
I can't just sit here!

454
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,535
I have to prepare to
summon my Servant!

455
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,875
<i>Mikina Nishimoto, the sixth-grade girl who
went missing in Fuyuki two nights ago,</i>

456
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,960
Serial Killings in Fuyuki City <i>Good</i> morning, Waver. Mikina Nishimoto,
the sixth-grade girl who went missing in Fuyuki two nights ago,

457
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,587
Morning, Waver! <i>...was found dead this
morning in the woods near Fukuyama Town.</i>

458
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,047
<i>...was found dead this morning
in the woods near Fukuyama Town.</i>

459
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,425
Morning, Grandpa... Grandma.

460
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,553
Even Fuyuki's getting bad
these days.

461
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,555
It really is.

462
00:32:53,973 --> 00:33:00,062
Anyway, Martha, roosters have been
making a racket since the sun came up.

463
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,939
What's that all about?

464
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,401
There are three roosters
in our yard.

465
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,069
In ours?

466
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,073
That's right. I wonder
where they came from?

467
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,076
Waver, you want
some coffee?

468
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,831
Waver, what happened
to your hand?

469
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,582
Crap!

470
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,625
That mark!

471
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,960
Mark?

472
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,713
You didn't have that mark
on your hand yesterday.

473
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:30,342
Jeez... I wish you
hadn't noticed that.

474
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,761
What's wrong, Waver?

475
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,221
Waver?

476
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,933
Nothing's wrong.
Here, have some coffee.

477
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,893
I put lots of milk
in it.

478
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,064
You two
like coffee, right?

479
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,700
Do I have to start their
hypnosis all over again,

480
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,829
...starting from me being their grandson,
just back from studying abroad?

481
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,628
I need to think of a cover story
for those roosters I stole, too.

482
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:11,967
I can't believe they really found the
legendary Excalibur's scabbard.

483
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:17,264
There's not a scratch on it.
Is this thing really 1,500 years old?

484
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,976
The object itself is a type
of Conceptual Weapon.

485
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,730
It doesn't rust or degrade,
as ordinary physical objects do.

486
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:31,945
Just like in the legend, it heals its owner's
wounds and halts the aging process.

487
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,492
Of course, that's only when supplied
with its original owner's mana.

488
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:40,496
In other words, a Master
can use this in tandem...

489
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,083
...with the summoned Heroic Spirit
to protect himself.

490
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:48,796
That's just like you. You're saying
that a tool is just a tool?

491
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,632
That goes for
the Servant, too.

492
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,468
No matter how famous
the Heroic Spirit,

493
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:59,014
...when summoned as a Servant, they're
nothing but a tool for their Master.

494
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,892
Anyone who lets their fantasies
get the better of them...

495
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,062
...will never be able
to win this battle.

496
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,690
And because you're this way,
my great-grandfather decided...

497
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,527
...that this scabbard was
the perfect relic for you.

498
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,320
What do you think?

499
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,824
Does his present
not satisfy you?

500
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,327
Of course not. Acht did
a wonderful job.

501
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,039
None of the other Masters
have something this powerful.

502
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,999
What's wrong with it, then?

503
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,753
Given how perfectly the relic
is connected to it,

504
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:34,716
...the spirit we're after will surely
respond to the summons.

505
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,012
The legendary King of Knights,
Arthur Pendragon.

506
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:43,600
My own compatibility with him
is a secondary concern.

507
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:50,774
But the wielder of Excalibur is sure to
be the strongest Saber-class Servant.

508
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:55,988
That's true. I'll have a Servant
far stronger than any other.

509
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:01,785
The question is how
to use that power.

510
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,080
To be honest, in terms
of ease of use,

511
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,877
...Caster or Assassin would be
far better suited to me.

512
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,839
What good will it do to worry about that
before you've even summoned him?

513
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,093
After all, we don't know what
the King of Knights was like.

514
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:24,683
And besides, no matter what you decide,
once he learns of your ideal...

515
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,353
Of your dream...
He'll understand.

516
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:31,982
Just like I did.

517
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,155
What?

518
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,407
I've found my strategy.

519
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:47,289
The way I can get the best use
from the strongest Servant.

520
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,798
Hello, Rin.

521
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,886
Hello, Kirei.

522
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,806
Heading out? That's some
heavy luggage you have.

523
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:08,852
That's right. I'm going to live
with the Zenjo family.

524
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:15,442
You're staying to fight
with my dad, right?

525
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,904
That's why I'm here
as his student.

526
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:23,992
Kirei...
Can I believe in you?

527
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:30,082
Will you promise to protect
my father to the end?

528
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,709
I'm afraid that's impossible.

529
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:37,172
If this battle were simple enough
that I could make that promise,

530
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,968
...we wouldn't have to send
you or his wife away.

531
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,933
I guess I just can't
like you.

532
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:52,813
Rin, you shouldn't just blurt out
what you're really thinking.

533
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:57,734
People will start to cast aspersions on
your father, the man educating you.

534
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,569
My dad has nothing
to do with it!

535
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,988
Listen, Kirei!

536
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:05,200
If you get sloppy
and my dad gets hurt,

537
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,369
...I'll show you no mercy,
got it?!

538
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:11,373
Rin, what are you doing?
You're yelling.

539
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,625
Um...

540
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:15,752
Well...

541
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:20,632
She was giving me a pep talk
before we said goodbye, Ma'am.

542
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,971
Allow me. That suitcase
is far too heavy for you.

543
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,181
It's fine.
I'll carry it myself.

544
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:33,020
Mr. Kotomine, please take care
of my husband.

545
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,689
Help him achieve
his desire.

546
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,775
I will do my best.
Don't worry.

547
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,448
Excuse me.

548
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,242
You came at
an opportune time.

549
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:51,121
The relic I arranged for
finally arrived this morning.

550
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,456
Have a look.

551
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,000
What is it?

552
00:38:56,168 --> 00:39:01,673
A fossil of the very first skin
shed by a snake on this world.

553
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:05,927
If we use it as a catalyst and are lucky
enough to summon what we're after,

554
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:10,265
...victory is as good
as ours.

555
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,567
Hey, Sakura.
Did I surprise you?

556
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,070
Your face...

557
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,988
Yeah, I know.

558
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:29,076
Seems I lost a little bit
to the worms inside me.

559
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:33,080
I guess I'm not as
tough as you are.

560
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,794
You're turning into a
different person, aren't you?

561
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,964
Maybe.

562
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:47,761
I don't have to go to
the worm pit tonight.

563
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:51,681
Grandfather said there will be
a more important ceremony.

564
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,433
Yeah, I know.

565
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,978
That's why I'm going to the basement
tonight instead of you.

566
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,774
Are you going away,
Uncle Kariya?

567
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:05,362
I have an important job
to do for a while.

568
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:10,826
I might not have much time
to talk to you then.

569
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,203
I see.

570
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,580
Hey, Sakura.

571
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,335
When my job's over, want to go
somewhere with everyone and have fun?

572
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,462
With your mom
and sister?

573
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:28,135
I don't have anyone I can
call Mom or Sister.

574
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:33,640
Grandfather said I should think of them
like they never existed.

575
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,601
I see...

576
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,029
Uncle?

577
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:52,742
Then let's take Aoi
and Rin...

578
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:56,872
...from the Tohsakas and go
somewhere far away.

579
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:01,293
We can hang out and have fun
like we used to.

580
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,172
I can see them again?

581
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:09,843
Yeah, you will.
You have my word.

582
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,768
Well, I have to get going.

583
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:19,853
Okay.

584
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,857
Bye-bye, Uncle Kariya.

585
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,070
BYE-bye...

586
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,075
You've memorized the
summoning spell, right?

587
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:35,535
Yes.

588
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:41,917
Very well. But I'll have you add
two extra lines to the incantation.

589
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,712
- What do you mean?
- It's simple.

590
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:53,678
Kariya, your rank as a mage is somewhat
lower than that of the other Masters.

591
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:56,598
That will affect the Servant's
base abilities.

592
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,935
This means that we have to
pick the Servant's class...

593
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,064
...so we can use its modifiers
to boost those abilities.

594
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,107
Kariya.

595
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:11,988
I want you to add the affinity "Berserk"
to the Servant you summon.

596
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:17,118
<i>Fill, fill, fill, fill, fill!</i>

597
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,663
<i>Repeat five times.</i>

598
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,082
<i>But when each is filled,
destroy it.</i>

599
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,960
<i>For the elements,
silver and iron.</i>

600
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,171
<i>For the foundation, stone and
the Archduke of Pacts.</i>

601
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,174
<i>And for the ancestor,
my great master, Schweinorg.</i>

602
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,387
<i>Raise a wall to block the falling wind.
Close the gates of the four directions.</i>

603
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,267
<i>Come forth from the Crown and follow
the forked road leading to the Kingdom.</i>

604
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:45,772
Is a simple ritual like this enough
to summon a Heroic Spirit?

605
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,983
Surprisingly, yes.

606
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:53,780
The summoning ritual doesn't
require an elaborate evocation.

607
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,534
The Grail itself does
the actual summoning.

608
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:03,039
As a Master, my job is to anchor
the spirit in this world once it appears,

609
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,793
...and to give it enough mana
to take physical form.

610
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:08,712
That should do it.

611
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,632
Iri, put the relic on the altar.

612
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,510
That's the last step.

613
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,262
<i>Heed my words.</i>

614
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:21,975
<i>My will creates your body, and your
sword creates my destiny.</i>

615
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:26,021
<i>If you heed the Grail's call
and obey my will and reason,</i>

616
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:28,189
<i>...then answer me!</i>

617
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:29,983
<i>I hereby swear...</i>

618
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,902
<i>That I shall be all the good
in the world.</i>

619
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:37,198
<i>That I shall defeat all evil
in the world.</i>

620
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,995
<i>But let thine eyes be
clouded with chaos.</i>

621
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,789
<i>Thou, who art trapped
in a cage of madness.</i>

622
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,001
<i>And I, who holds
thy chains!</i>

623
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,338
<i>Thou Seventh Heaven, clad in
the three great words of power,</i>

624
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,342
<i>...come forth from the circle of binding,
Guardian of the Scales!</i>

625
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,752
We've won the battle, Kirei.

626
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,922
Victory is ours!

627
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,472
Who--

628
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:44,766
I ask you...

629
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:54,025
Are you my Master?

630
00:44:55,026 --> 00:45:00,073
Episode 1:
The Summoning of Heroes

631
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:19,259
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

632
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:25,390
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

633
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:31,771
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

634
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:38,486
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

635
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,659
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

636
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:52,375
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

637
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,628
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

638
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,673
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

639
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:04,596
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

640
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:10,268
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

641
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,022
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

642
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:20,779
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

643
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:26,868
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

644
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:33,393
I think what you
and Kiritsugu seek is right.

645
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,478
The world cannot serve
two lords.

646
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,771
Then I promise you.

647
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,982
You aren't worthy
to look upon me.

648
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,817
You're so cool!

649
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:44,988
Eliminate Tokiomi Tohsaka
at once.
