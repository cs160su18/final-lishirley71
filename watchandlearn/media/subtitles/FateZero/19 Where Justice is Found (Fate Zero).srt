1
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,233
Hurts, doesn't it?

2
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,821
Mages carry the pain of that
Crest their entire lives.

3
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:35,327
Your dad really gave you
the perfect name.

4
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:43,127
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

5
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,756
The nuance is a little different than
destruction and regeneration.

6
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,884
If you cut a thread and then retie it,

7
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,345
...it will be thicker where
it was cut, right?

8
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:57,767
In that sense, it carries
a connotation of irreversible change.

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,439
"Kiritsugu," with the characters
for "cut" and "tie."

10
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,151
I have the perfect Mystic Code for you.

11
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,911
I've powdered some of your ribs
and put part in here.

12
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,874
Your origin will materialize in
anything shot by this.

13
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,795
If you fire when your target's
Magic Circuits are active,

14
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:29,507
...it will cut his circuits,
then tie them improperly.

15
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,551
One shot will incapacitate most any mage.

16
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,596
I've made sixty-six in total.

17
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,431
Don't waste them.

18
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:05,376
Natalia, do you read me?
I'm almost there.

19
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,418
Roger.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,597
Natalia, now.

21
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,184
<i>In the end,</i>

22
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,188
<i>...after leaving the island, I spent
the next several years...</i>

23
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:12,484
<i>...with Natalia Kaminski, the woman
who took me from there.</i>

24
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>That meant choosing the
same path as Natalia.</i>

25
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>The path of a hunter.</i>

26
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,709
<i>Natalia belonged to no organization.</i>

27
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:33,172
<i>She was a total freelancer,
only interested in the money.</i>

28
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,468
<i>The Mages Association and the Church.</i>

29
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,429
<i>The rivalry between those two
enormous organizations...</i>

30
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,599
<i>...kept her business booming.</i>

31
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,615
<i>Since that time,</i>

32
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,911
<i>...I'd witnessed many tragedies
like the one at Arimago Island.</i>

33
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,250
<i>I'd learned that all across the world,</i>

34
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,462
<i>...the same horrors happened every day.</i>

35
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,422
Are you trying to be a hero?

36
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,890
Was there no meaning to it?

37
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:55,272
I thought I had killed my father to keep
more people like them from dying.

38
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,320
Killing one man isn't the solution.

39
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,784
Kill every single person, all around
the world, who is like our target here.

40
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:12,039
If you could do that,
maybe it would be possible.

41
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,169
I was kidding.
Don't take it seriously.

42
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,971
No matter what happens,
do what you must to survive.

43
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,475
That's a rule I set for myself
when I got started in this business.

44
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:36,021
No matter what happens, put your own life
ahead of anything and anyone else.

45
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,822
If you try to save someone and you die,
it'll all be for nothing.

46
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,701
I don't think it's possible to save everyone.

47
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,833
But I do want to save
as many as I can.

48
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,419
Suit yourself.

49
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,730
This target is a nasty
piece of work.

50
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,441
Do you know him?

51
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,193
The mage Odd Vorzak.

52
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:27,448
He's a Dead Apostle who uses his bee familiars
to increase his number of ghouls.

53
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:31,577
The Mages Association has put
a huge bounty on his head.

54
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,245
You know a lot about him.

55
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,584
He causes a lot of destruction.

56
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,255
The last town he visited
was utterly destroyed.

57
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:44,840
A town...

58
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,895
Natalia,
can I have one?

59
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,691
How old do you need to be
to smoke in your country?

60
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,819
I won't stop you, but they
aren't good for you.

61
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,835
Where's he going?

62
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,380
The flight from Paris
to New York in four days.

63
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,299
Vorzak will be on board.

64
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,093
I'll be on it.

65
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,306
He's a target who
gave me the slip once.

66
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,476
You've gotta clean up
your own messes, right?

67
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,978
So even you fail sometimes?

68
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,814
That should tell you
how tough he is.

69
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,821
What should I do?

70
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:54,618
He probably has associates
in New York.

71
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,038
I want you to eliminate them.

72
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,917
You'll fight Vorzak alone?

73
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,338
He can't keep his bees
with him in a carry-on.

74
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,467
There's no risk of him
getting away from you this time.

75
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,971
Shut your mouth, kid.

76
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,440
Kid, do you copy?

77
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,861
Okay, loud and clear.

78
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,032
All right, good luck
to both of us.

79
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,724
Easier than I expected...

80
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:45,937
I'm just glad that you were able to kill him
with a minimum of force, Natalia.

81
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,201
All right, Kiritsugu, his corpse
is in the passenger cabin...

82
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,161
Are you ready to carry it out?

83
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,955
I've secured a vehicle.

84
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:09,378
All we need now is a doctor who's
ready to carry out a sick patient.

85
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,881
I don't have a license,
if that's okay.

86
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,023
Hey!

87
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,359
Natalia, what's wrong?

88
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,486
A ghoul!

89
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,118
We have a problem.

90
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:47,290
He was keeping the bees
inside his own body?

91
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,711
Natalia, you have to get out.

92
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,255
How high up
do you think I am?

93
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,758
Unfortunately, I didn't come
prepared to skydive out of--

94
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,013
This isn't good.

95
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,349
Looks like they've taken the cockpit.

96
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,525
I have no choice.

97
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,530
Natalia, don't tell me you're--

98
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,450
I'm going home.

99
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,787
I'm going home alive,
carrying Vorzak's body.

100
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,124
For that to happen, I need to do
something about this plane.

101
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,378
Anything you want to say?

102
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,840
Yeah.
Natalia, you can do this.

103
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,050
That will do...

104
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,887
Prepare a nice, warm bed
for me, and then wait.

105
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,201
Do you read me, kid?

106
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
You didn't fall asleep, did you?

107
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,580
Reading you loud and
clear, Natalia.

108
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,292
We've both been up all night.
It's a rough morning.

109
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:18,381
If you'd slept in a bed last night, I really
would have to kill you after all this is over.

110
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,594
Now, I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want first?

111
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,598
Isn't it the rule to start
with the good news?

112
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,016
Okay.

113
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,393
First, the good news.

114
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,522
For the moment, I'm alive.

115
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,816
The plane is also undamaged.

116
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,903
I made it up to the
cockpit fairly easily,

117
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,614
...though repairing the comms
array wasn't so easy.

118
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,119
I also think I can pilot it, assuming
the controls are similar to a Cessna.

119
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,413
Have you contacted
the control tower?

120
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,417
I have. They thought I was
pulling a prank at first.

121
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,921
Those kind folks say
they'll escort me in.

122
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,633
And the bad news?

123
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,346
I'm the only one who
hasn't been bitten.

124
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,057
Three hundred passengers and crew.

125
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,434
They've all become ghouls now.

126
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,230
All that separates me from the
night of the living, flying dead...

127
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,108
...is the cockpit door.

128
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,026
<i>Spooky, right?</i>

129
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,824
Given all that, will you be able
to make it back alive?

130
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,327
Well, the door's pretty tough.

131
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:34,583
They're scratching at it as we speak.
But they can't break it down.

132
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,586
It's the landing that worries me.

133
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,172
This thing may be too large
for me to handle.

134
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,677
I know you'll be able to manage it.

135
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,681
Were those words
of encouragement?

136
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,474
Good to hear them.

137
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,896
I can handle the landing,

138
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,690
...but what do I do with
these monsters in back?

139
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,861
Don't worry about that.

140
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,322
I have it all worked out, Natalia.

141
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,827
I can always count on you.

142
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,038
Fifty minutes to the airport.

143
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,041
Too long to spend praying.

144
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,960
Kid, keep me company
for a while.

145
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,462
No problem.

146
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,744
When you said you wanted
to help with my work,

147
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,163
...I really didn't know
how to respond.

148
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,292
You didn't look ready to relent,
no matter what I said.

149
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,129
I showed that little promise
as a student?

150
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,634
No, it's not that.
You had too much potential.

151
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,177
Far too much...

152
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,012
What does that mean?

153
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,350
The ability to pull a trigger,
regardless of your feelings,

154
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:19,980
...is a skill most killers
take years to develop.

155
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,775
You had it from the start.

156
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,402
It's a hell of a gift.

157
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,990
But choosing your occupation
based solely on your talents...

158
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,909
...doesn't necessarily
guarantee your happiness.

159
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,620
If you think only of what you should do,

160
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,207
...and ignore what you want to do,

161
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,710
...you're just a machine.

162
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,378
A force of nature.

163
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,964
That isn't how a human
being should live.

164
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:52,804
I always thought of you
as a much colder person.

165
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,932
What are you talking about?
Of course I am.

166
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,894
Have I ever spoiled you, even once?

167
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,982
True. You've always been
a strict teacher.

168
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:08,820
You never held back. You did
whatever you could to teach me.

169
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,910
Normally, raising a boy
is the father's job.

170
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,831
Well, ah...

171
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:28,131
In your case, I basically took
away your chance for that.

172
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,011
Well, anyway,
I did feel a little bad about it.

173
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:38,433
This was the only way of
life I could teach you.

174
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,062
So you consider yourself my dad?

175
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Don't get my gender wrong,
you rude little jerk.

176
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,859
At least call me "Mother."

177
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,153
You're right. I'm sorry.

178
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,784
I spent a long time on my own
in this bloody business.

179
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,954
So long, I forgot I even was alone.

180
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,331
Well...

181
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,667
It's been pretty entertaining,
in its own way...

182
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,629
Having something like a family.

183
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,297
For me, too.

184
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,718
I really did think of
you as a mother.

185
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,138
I was happy not to be alone.

186
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,516
Hey, Kiritsugu...

187
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:24,562
Quit saying stuff that'll embarrass us
next time we see each other.

188
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,525
Jeez.
You're throwing me off.

189
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,402
I gotta land in twenty minutes or so.

190
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,947
If I'm laughing over what we were just talking about
while I'm trying to land this thing and screw up,

191
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,490
...I'll end up dead, you know?

192
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,577
Sorry, I'll stop.

193
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,085
Maybe I'm getting
too old for this...

194
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,255
Maybe the reason
I screwed up so badly...

195
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,259
...is because playing at having a family
made me lower my guard.

196
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,220
If that's the case,
it's time to walk away.

197
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,722
Maybe I should retire.

198
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,519
If you quit this job,
what would you do then?

199
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,230
If I weren't working...

200
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:13,153
The only thing left would be
to really act like a mother.

201
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,003
You are...

202
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,383
...my real family...

203
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,639
Did you see that, Shirley?

204
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,145
I killed again...

205
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,023
Just like with my dad.

206
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,026
I didn't screw up,
like I did with you.

207
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,321
I saved a lot of lives...

208
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,784
If Natalia had landed safely,

209
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:48,039
...there's no telling how many
people might have died.

210
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,214
Her sacrifice prevented that...

211
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,926
So... So...

212
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,552
Shirley...

213
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,222
I...

214
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,983
Shut up! Shut up!

215
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,026
You bastard!

216
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>Kerry, what kind of person do you want
to be when you grow up?</i>

217
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,419
I...

218
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,135
Shizuka ni matataku Hoshitachi no chiriyuku sora
In the sky where stars twinkle quietly,

219
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,261
I...
Shizuka ni matataku Hoshitachi no chiriyuku sora
In the sky where stars twinkle quietly,

220
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:48,516
Shizuka ni matataku Hoshitachi no chiriyuku sora
In the sky where stars twinkle quietly,

221
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,979
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

222
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,982
Episode 19: Where Justice Is Found
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

223
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:00,445
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

224
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,118
Hosoi eda ni hikaru no wa
What you see shining on that slender branch

225
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,621
Saki wasureta mirai
is a future that forgot to bloom.

226
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:18,212
Mada nagori oshisouni tsubomi wo otoshita
It sheds its flower buds, as if unwilling to let go.

227
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:22,258
Hora mou toki wa michite
Look, the time has come.

228
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:29,682
Minoru kin no kajitsu Sono te de tsumitoru dake de
All you need to do is pluck that ripe, golden fruit

229
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,519
Sekai wa owaru kara
to end the world.

230
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:41,027
Kegarenu mono toshite furu yuki no shirosa wa
The pure white of the snow, falling
from the sky as something unsullied,

231
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,409
Nukumori wo shireba kiete shimau no
will vanish the instant it knows warmth.

232
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:55,375
Kirei na yume dake ga anata wo kirisaita
Only beautiful dreams sliced you.

233
00:22:55,458 --> 00:23:03,508
Tsumetai hitomi no yasashisa to shinjitsu
The kindness and truth of cold eyes.

234
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:11,015
Shizuka ni matataku hoshi tachi no inori no sora
The sky is full of the prayers of the quietly twinkling stars

235
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:24,654
Anata no sakebi de Kono yume ga owaru
will remain until this dream ends with your screams.

236
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,532
Who are you?

237
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,200
You take your jokes too far.

238
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,828
How does the life you took
from Sakura feel?

239
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,746
By my Command Seal,
I order my puppet...

240
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,124
That's the expression
you used to wear.

241
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,418
This is a battle I began.

242
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,003
Next Time: Return of the Assassin
You know, I really am happy.
