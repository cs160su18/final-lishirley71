1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,718
Madam?

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,179
Please hurry.

3
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:20,855
Madam?

4
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,607
Another intruder.

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,485
They're waiting in the direction
we're headed.

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,113
We'll run into them
if we go this way.

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,364
Understood.

8
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,117
Let's circle around
to the north side, then.

9
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:36,912
Madam?

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,998
The one who's coming is...

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,626
...Kirei Kotomine.

12
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:03,272
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

13
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:09,403
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

14
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:15,785
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

15
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:22,500
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

16
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:28,672
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

17
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:36,388
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,642
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,686
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
 What I wanted to give you was the future.

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,609
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,281
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

22
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:58,035
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

23
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,792
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

24
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:10,881
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

25
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,557
Kirei Kotomine?

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,773
Maiya, your orders from Kiritsugu were
to protect me, right?

27
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:28,774
Yes.

28
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,069
- But...
- But what?

29
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,283
We mustn't let him get to Kiritsugu,
no matter what.

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,202
Is that what you're thinking?

31
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,833
Madam. How did you-

32
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:50,796
What a coincidence,
I was thinking the same thing.

33
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,465
Kirei Kotomine...

34
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:58,012
He probably represents
the biggest threat to Kiritsugu.

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,307
You and I will hold him off here!

36
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,893
Understood, Maiya?

37
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:10,399
I apologize.
But please prepare yourself, Madam.

38
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:14,111
I will. Don't worry about me.

39
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,572
Do what you must do.

40
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,911
What you believe to be necessary,
not what Kiritsugu told you to do.

41
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,332
Is there something else?

43
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,666
No.

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,421
The human heart is a funny thing, isn't it?

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,310
You repeat an attack you know
to be futile...

46
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,826
<i>Sculp!</i>

47
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:23,138
He breached Volumen Hydragram's
autonomous defense?

48
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,812
No... His childish attacks lulled me
into lowering my guard.

49
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,901
I shall take steps to provide for a swifter,
more efficient defense.

50
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,989
You are a disgrace to mages everywhere.

51
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,991
You piece of lowborn trash!

52
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:47,162
For spilling my blood,
you will pay with your life.

53
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:58,173
<i>He knows how powerful this is now.
It won't work on him twice.</i>

54
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,469
<i>Next time, he'll channel
all his mana into defense.</i>

55
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:04,513
No...

56
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,850
<i>That's exactly what I need him to do.</i>

57
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,752
An illusion?

58
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,812
Maiya, no!

59
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,093
Madam... Don't!

60
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,514
Woman, this may come as a surprise,

61
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,975
...but I haven't come here
to defeat you.

62
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,230
I know that, Kirei Kotomine.

63
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,610
I know what you desire.
But I will not allow it.

64
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,863
You will never reach
Kiritsugu Emiya.

65
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,324
We will stop you.

66
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,243
Here.

67
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,285
Madam!

68
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,831
He is an Executor...
An expert at hunting mages!

69
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,291
Normal magic won't
be enough to stop him!

70
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,839
Kiritsugu taught me more...

71
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,966
...than how to drive a car.

72
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,594
He taught me to live.
And to survive!

73
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,805
<i>Shape Ist Leben!</i>

74
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,878
- Madam!
- It won't be that easy!

75
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,683
Maiya!

76
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,394
Finish him!

77
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,407
It can't be...

78
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,365
You bastard...

79
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:07,422
I'm honestly stunned that
we've made so little progress.

80
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,800
It's that grimoire, Lancer.

81
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,680
As long as he holds that Noble Phantasm,
our situation will not improve.

82
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,683
I see... So that's his secret.

83
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:22,771
But if you plan to knock the book
from that pale freak's hands,

84
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,900
...you'll need to get past
this wall of monsters.

85
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,863
Lancer... What say you to
taking an all-or-nothing gamble?

86
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:37,286
It feels a bit shameful, but there's
no glory simply in fighting these things.

87
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,872
Very well. Count me in, Saber.

88
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,168
I shall clear a path.
We shall have but one chance at this.

89
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,297
Lancer, can you run on the wind?

90
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,883
Ah, I understand you.
It is child's play.

91
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,470
Have you said your prayers?

92
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,182
Tremble... Despair.

93
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:04,896
Superior skill can only defeat so many
before being overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

94
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,901
It must be humiliating, right?

95
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:15,657
You will die, suffocated under a horde of
monsters that know nothing of honor or glory!

96
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,745
There can be no greater
disgrace for a hero.

97
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,873
That beautiful face...

98
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,752
Make it twist in pain
for me, Jeanne!

99
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,508
<i>Strike Air!</i>

100
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,102
Prepare yourself...

101
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,773
Strike home!

102
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,066
<i>Gae Dearg!</i>

103
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,342
Damn you...

104
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,929
Damn you, damn you, damn you...
Damn you! Damn you!

105
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,847
Damn you!

106
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,101
How did you like that?

107
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:29,648
Had Saber suddenly regained the use of
her left hand, this would have been the result.

108
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,110
Prepare to die.

109
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,029
Monster.

110
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,630
Pathetic.

111
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:59,261
I didn't join the Holy Grail War
to fight this sort of battle!

112
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
Where is he?

113
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,741
There you are...

114
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,827
You skulking rat.

115
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,753
Surely you don't expect the same trick
to work on me a second time, do you?

116
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,546
Lowborn scum!

117
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,509
The fact that you succeeded in
landing a single blow...

118
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,220
...wasn't due to any strategy of yours.

119
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,682
It was a fluke, plain and simple.

120
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,642
I'll see to it that you understand
the difference.

121
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,353
I shan't let you die easily.

122
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,732
I shall use healing magic to
regenerate your heart and lungs...

123
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,902
...while I rend every inch of flesh.

124
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,406
In pain and despair,
you will die as you suffer.

125
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,493
And while you die, you will curse them...

126
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,329
You will curse the cowardice
of those who hired you!

127
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,916
You will curse the Einzberns
for making a mockery of the Grail War!

128
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,253
<i>Fervor Mei Sanguis!</i>

129
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,847
I knew you'd do that, fool!

130
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,442
Your struggles are in vain!

131
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,920
How cowardly can he get?

132
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,089
Lancer...

133
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,759
Is something wrong?

134
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,016
My Master is in danger...

135
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,896
It seems he left me here
and breached the castle himself.

136
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,027
I'm certain that the danger
comes from my own Master.

137
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,906
Lancer, hurry to his side.

138
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,409
Go to your Master's aid.

139
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,455
King of Knights, you have my thanks.

140
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:33,957
Think nothing of it.

141
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,335
You and I have sworn to settle matters
in a manner befitting two knights.

142
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,671
Let us keep our pride intact.

143
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:51,558
This means that all went
according to Kiritsugu's plan, then?

144
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,650
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

145
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,027
To cut and tie...

146
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:09,284
The nuance is a little different than
destruction and regeneration.

147
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,495
If you cut a thread and then retie it,

148
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,498
...it will be thicker where
you cut it, right?

149
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,711
In that sense, it carries
a connotation of irreversible change.

150
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:29,346
I've powdered some of your ribs
and put part in here.

151
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,391
Your origin will materialize in
anything shot by this.

152
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,519
It's especially powerful
against mages.

153
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:43,777
If they use any magic against it,
your origin will destroy their Magic Circuits,

154
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,612
...which will then reconnect improperly.

155
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:51,159
The more powerful the mage, the more
their Magic Circuits will run haywire and short out.

156
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,623
Naturally, they won't recover,
either as a mage or a human.

157
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,710
This is for your Mystic Code,
origin rounds.

158
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,004
I've made 66 in total.

159
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,757
Don't waste them.

160
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:57,100
You know how easy it would be
for me to skewer you now, correct?

161
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,936
Master of Saber.

162
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,272
So that's it...

163
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,858
I shall not let you kill my Master.

164
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,402
Nor will I kill Saber's Master.

165
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,906
Neither of us wish for our duel
to be ended that way.

166
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,867
Never forget this.

167
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,911
The reason you survived our encounter...

168
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,290
...is the nobility demonstrated
by the King of Knights.

169
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,011
Woman, I have one question.

170
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:37,682
It appears that you challenged me...

171
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,685
...with the intent to protect Kiritsugu Emiya.

172
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,398
By whose order did you attack me?

173
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,235
You do not possess Command Seals,

174
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,363
...so you are not
the Einzbern Master.

175
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:57,035
Most likely, you are a homunculus,
charged with protecting the Grail Vessel.

176
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:01,206
Someone like that could not
be stupid enough...

177
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,583
...to risk going to the front lines of the battle.

178
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,836
So I ask again...

179
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,174
Who ordered you to fight?

180
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,686
Master Kirei...

181
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:30,276
Caster, as well as
Lancer and his Master, have left the forest.

182
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,737
Saber will arrive shortly.

183
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,199
My lord, it is dangerous here.

184
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,543
Fascinating.

185
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,336
So it's red, after all.

186
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,850
<i>Impossible.</i>

187
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,853
<i>Could these women have challenged me
of their own accord,</i>

188
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,522
<i>...without being ordered to do so?</i>

189
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,608
<i>Impossible.</i>

190
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,070
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya is like me.</i>

191
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:19,409
<i>Alone and empty, understood by no one.</i>

192
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,997
<i>He must be.</i>

193
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:26,875
Irisviel...

194
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,960
Irisviel!

195
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,712
Wake up.

196
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,758
Saber...

197
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,718
No!

198
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,386
You must stay awake!

199
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,597
I'll call Kiritsugu.

200
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,765
Be strong until then!

201
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:48,354
Where is Kirei?
The enemy who was just here?

202
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,772
He escaped.

203
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,403
Had I been only a second faster,
this would not have happened.

204
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,781
What about Maiya?

205
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,535
Her wounds are grave,
but not life-threatening.

206
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,412
I'm more concerned about you.

207
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,414
You've lost so much blood...

208
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,794
Irisviel?

209
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,593
How can this be?

210
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,889
I want you to carry Avalon, Iri.

211
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,436
But this is a Noble Phantasm that heals
its bearer's wounds.

212
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,230
I think you should keep it.

213
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,272
No.

214
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,319
Unless its original owner, Saber,
is nearby to supply it with mana,

215
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,738
...the scabbard won't work.

216
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,326
You'll be the one working with Saber
from now on.

217
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,286
So you should have it.

218
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,456
Keep it within you,
as a Conceptual Weapon.

219
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,460
Additionally, tell no one of this.

220
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,837
Indeed, not even Saber herself.

221
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,056
<i>From the moment you touched me,</i>

222
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,183
<i>...I felt Avalon's power.</i>

223
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,353
<i>Thank you, Saber.</i>

224
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>Kirei Kotomine...</i>

225
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,321
<i>That Executor is just as dangerous
as I imagined.</i>

226
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,407
<i>No, even more so.</i>

227
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,412
<i>We were lucky today, but there's
no telling what will happen next time.</i>

228
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,875
<i>All I know for certain is that
I can't let him get to Kiritsugu.</i>

229
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:39,549
<i>But I'm not the only one
who's protecting Kiritsugu.</i>

230
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,885
<i>Isn't that right, Maiya?</i>

231
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,098
<i>Next time, we'll win for sure.</i>

232
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,894
<i>We'll both protect Kiritsugu, okay?</i>

233
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,983
Episode 8:
The Mage-Slayer

234
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:05,199
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

235
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:14,000
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

236
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:29,015
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

237
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:37,273
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

238
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:46,366
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

239
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:52,747
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

240
00:22:53,247 --> 00:23:01,381
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

241
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:08,304
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

242
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:16,396
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

243
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:24,821
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

244
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,744
My Master is in mortal peril!

245
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,080
Dignity is required, even in battle.

246
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,582
I cannot consent to that.

247
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,793
Give me the Command Seals...

248
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,004
Lancer isn't the fine man you think he is!
