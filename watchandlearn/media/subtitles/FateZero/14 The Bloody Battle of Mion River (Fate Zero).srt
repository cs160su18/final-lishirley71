1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:09,218
If there really is a giant monster up there,
will they give us permission to engage?

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:13,347
If this were a monster movie,
we'd be goners.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,393
We'd just be there for it to kill us
before the Giant of Light shows up.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,062
That isn't funny.

5
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:23,065
Well, we'll know for sure
soon enough.

6
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,436
It's no use...

7
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,521
It's restoring itself.

8
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,649
Its regenerative power is incredible.

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,652
It's all they can do just to keep it
from coming ashore.

10
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,115
I cannot reach Caster like this...

11
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,454
This is amazing...Just amazing!

12
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,290
Seriously amazing, Big Guy!

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,335
God is with us...

14
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,463
God is with us!

15
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:55,074
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time

16
00:01:55,157 --> 00:02:01,038
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

17
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:07,378
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

18
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,299
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

19
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:20,141
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

20
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,435
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

21
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:29,650
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

22
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,822
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

23
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,158
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

24
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:42,037
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

25
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,207
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

26
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,585
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

27
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:54,341
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

28
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,556
What a complete disaster.

29
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,394
In the Holy Grail War's long history,

30
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,689
...there has never been
a failure such as this.

31
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,400
According to observer reports,

32
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,196
...the Mion River area is
engulfed by a thick fog.

33
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,200
But a large number of bystanders
is beginning to gather.

34
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,786
This is now beyond our
ability to control.

35
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,333
We shall have to request aid
from the Mages Association.

36
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,631
And where is Tokiomi?

37
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,928
My master heads there now,
with Archer in tow.

38
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,805
Kirei...

39
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,808
I will handle the cover-up.

40
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,355
You go and assist Tokiomi.

41
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,566
Understood, Father.

42
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,703
What an utterly hideous
sight to behold...

43
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,167
Mongrels or not, they are still
supposedly famous warriors.

44
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,631
Yet not even together can they
finish that disgusting thing?

45
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,551
How very pathetic...

46
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,222
Do you not agree,

47
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,640
...Tokiomi?

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,355
<i>We must eliminate that monster
before further witnesses see it.</i>

49
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,817
<i>In the name of the Tohsaka family...</i>

50
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,739
King, that monster is a destructive pest
that tears apart your gardens.

51
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,784
I implore you to execute it.

52
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,997
That would be a gardener's work.

53
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,750
Or, Tokiomi, do you dare imply...

54
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,671
...that my Noble Phantasm is nothing
more than a gardener's spade?

55
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,298
Not at all!

56
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:02,386
But as you can see, the others are
unable to handle it themselves.

57
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,390
This is an excellent chance to display
the power wielded by a true hero.

58
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,434
I beg you...

59
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,640
Unbelievable.

60
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,436
We're leaving, Tokiomi.

61
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,230
I cannot bear to look upon that
nauseating thing further.

62
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,440
No...

63
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,692
King of Heroes, please wait!

64
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,736
Tokiomi,

65
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,741
...I have sacrificed four of my
swords and spears for you.

66
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,744
Now that they have touched that thing,

67
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,455
...I no longer even desire their return.

68
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,792
Do not impinge further
on my generosity.

69
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:19,004
You are the sole hero capable of
defeating that monstrosity.

70
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,632
Given how rapidly it regenerates,

71
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,094
...it must be destroyed
with a single attack!

72
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,763
And King of Heroes,

73
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,765
...the only thing capable of that
is your Sword of Rupture--

74
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,849
You dare?!

75
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,937
You would have me draw my
greatest treasure, Ea, here?

76
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,438
Know your place, Tokiomi!

77
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,859
To speak thus to a king
is punishable by death!

78
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>I could use a Command Seal,</i>

79
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,870
<i>...but it would severely damage my
relationship with the King of Heroes.</i>

80
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,625
<i>Father Risei and I devised
this entire plan...</i>

81
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,711
<i>...to restore my lost Command Seal
by eliminating Caster.</i>

82
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,799
<i>Why did it turn out this way?!</i>

83
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,099
Damn it...

84
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,646
What is that?

85
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,108
There's a strange light
at six o'clock, too.

86
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,821
That's no helicopter.
Is it a UFO or something?

87
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:31,285
Control to Diablo-1.
What is your situation?

88
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,829
My situation...

89
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,665
Um... Well...

90
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,544
I'll drop altitude and get a bit closer!

91
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,505
Wait, Kobayashi!

92
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,758
Get back here, Diabolo-2!

93
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,222
If I can get closer, I should be
able to see what that thing is!

94
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:54,766
Kobayashi?

95
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,329
Kobayashi!

96
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,084
What is that thing?

97
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,213
It... It ate it.

98
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,722
Control to Diabolo-1!

99
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,599
What the hell is
happening up there?

100
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,808
Report!

101
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,395
Eyes... There are eyes...

102
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,023
Eyes everywhere!

103
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,610
Eyes? What do you
mean by eyes?

104
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,322
Is it going to eat me, too?

105
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,574
<i>Captain Dug“.!</i>

106
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,536
Diabolo-1, engaging!

107
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,162
W-Wait, Ougi!

108
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,622
What's happ--

109
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,999
I'll kill it before it eats me.

110
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,627
I'll avenge Kobayashi...

111
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,630
I'll hit it with everything I have!

112
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:13,971
Berserker?

113
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,098
What's he doing here?

114
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,266
Fool!

115
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,809
Stay down!

116
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,603
Him again? Why now?

117
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,280
That's...

118
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,577
Oh? The mad dog again?

119
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,370
Interesting...

120
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,626
My King, I shall engage
his Master.

121
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,963
Very well.
Go and play with him.

122
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,258
Good luck, then.

123
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,694
A dog belongs with its
face to the ground.

124
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,989
You dare take to the heavens,
a king's realm?

125
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,327
Do not be arrogant, mongrel!

126
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,428
Such impertinence...

127
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,167
Fascinating.

128
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,295
I've not done anything like
this for a long time...

129
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,881
For a lowly beast,

130
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,218
...you do keep me entertained.

131
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,559
You've certainly changed
for the worse...

132
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,396
...Kariya Matou.

133
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,569
You abandoned magecraft,
but were still drawn to the Grail.

134
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,156
And now, you've returned
looking like that.

135
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,951
Your disgraceful behavior...

136
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,413
...reflects very poorly on the Matous.

137
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,794
Tokiomi Tohsaka, I have
one question for you.

138
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,798
Why did you give Sakura to Zouken?

139
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,508
What?

140
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,470
Should you really be concerned
with that right now?

141
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,806
Answer me, Tokiomi!

142
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,810
There is nothing to say.

143
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:11,148
I simply wished my daughter
to have a bright future.

144
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,150
What?

145
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,405
Any mage with two children must
face a painful dilemma.

146
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,950
Only one may inherit
the family secrets.

147
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:27,956
The other must be cast out
to become one of the rabble...

148
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,128
My wife's womb was too bountiful.

149
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,796
Both Rin and Sakura...

150
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,176
...were born with a rare
level of potential.

151
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:45,849
Both daughters required the
protection provided by a mage clan.

152
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,977
To destroy the possibilities held by one...

153
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,814
...for the sake of the other?

154
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,819
What father would desire
such a tragedy?

155
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,199
<i>One of the rabble...</i>

156
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,578
<i>The mother and two daughters
I saw on that day...</i>

157
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:11,208
<i>He would simply dismiss
them as rabble?</i>

158
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,213
To fulfill my wish that both their
talents might be developed,

159
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,924
...I had no choice but to
send one away to be adopted.

160
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,137
And so, the Matou family's request
was like a blessing from Heaven.

161
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,516
As a clan that
knows of the Grail,

162
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,977
...their odds of reaching the Root
become that much greater.

163
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,524
A mage is one who is
born with power.

164
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:39,986
And one who will someday
attain still greater power.

165
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,824
Even before they are
aware of this fate,

166
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,701
...the responsibility lies in their blood.

167
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,248
That is what it means to
be born a mage's child.

168
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,709
If I cannot attain it,

169
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,794
...Rin will.

170
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,505
And even if Rin cannot,

171
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,048
...Sakura will.

172
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,426
She will carry on the
Tohsaka family's wishes.

173
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,556
You...

174
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,269
You'd have them fight?
Sister against sister?

175
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,272
Even should that happen,

176
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,567
...my descendants will be happy.

177
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,734
What?

178
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,696
The glory goes to you if you are the victor.

179
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,490
And if you are not, it goes
to your ancestors' clan...

180
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,577
Could a more joyous battle exist?

181
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,288
You're insane!

182
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,875
It isn't even worth the trouble
of trying to explain it to you.

183
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,295
Not to a man who is blind
to magecraft's nobility,

184
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:42,674
...let alone a traitor who
turned his back on it.

185
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,301
Shut up!

186
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,245
I'll never forgive you people.

187
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,582
You disgusting mages...

188
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,918
I'll kill you.

189
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,088
Zouken and you, too!

190
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,965
I will kill...

191
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,008
...every last one of you!

192
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,470
You refused to carry
on the Matou line,

193
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,391
...so its magics went to Sakura.

194
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,395
Perhaps I should thank you.

195
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,146
But even so...

196
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,317
...I cannot forgive you, either.

197
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,364
Your weakness, in running from the
responsibility of your blood.

198
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,076
Your baseness, in failing to see
anything wrong in doing so.

199
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,705
Kariya Matou, you are a disgrace
to magecraft.

200
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,708
Having once more
encountered one other,

201
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,419
...what else can I do but kill you?

202
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,423
Shut the hell up...
You inhuman monster!

203
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,299
No.

204
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,554
Taking responsibility for yourself is the
first condition of being a human.

205
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,765
One who cannot do even that...

206
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,980
...is less than human, Kariya.

207
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,940
A dog.

208
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,985
Insects, devour him...

209
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,321
Eat him alive!

210
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,578
Get 'em, Bluebeard!

211
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,455
Crush 'em! Kill 'em!

212
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,583
This whole place is God's toy box!

213
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,877
Saber!

214
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,725
I am in your debt, Saber!

215
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,904
It's time to say goodbye
to boredom...

216
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,365
There's no need to go out of
my way to kill anymore.

217
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,494
I can just sit back and
watch them die.

218
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,789
Crushed...Torn apart...
Smashed...

219
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,248
Eaten!

220
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,418
They'll die, and die, and die!

221
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:11,508
I'll see all kinds of guts and gore
I've never seen before...

222
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,927
Every day... Every day.

223
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,888
Around the world!
Everywhere!

224
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,516
Never ending! Never even--

225
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,439
It stopped?

226
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,528
What?

227
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,780
Hey, what was that?

228
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,544
Wow, that's so pretty...

229
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,966
I get it...

230
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,136
Yeah, that's why I never noticed.

231
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,557
Sometimes you can't see
what's right in front of you.

232
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,560
What I was looking for...

233
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,521
It was in my own guts...

234
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:12,569
...this whole time...

235
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,488
Ryunosuke?

236
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,493
I finally found it.

237
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,872
I've been searching
for it forever...

238
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,500
What's wrong with you?

239
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,213
If it was inside me,
why didn't you ever tell me?

240
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,593
You should've just told me...

241
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,946
Ryunosuke...

242
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,865
My Master.

243
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,619
You have died and
left me all alone.

244
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,248
But do not worry, Ryunosuke.

245
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,292
For I, Gilles de Rais,

246
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,004
...shall fulfill my promise to you.

247
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,844
Behold, Ryunosuke!

248
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,721
A gift to see you to
the next world...

249
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,643
The greatest COOL!

250
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,735
I've shot the man we believed
to be Caster's Master.

251
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,655
Appears we were right.

252
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,867
Shall we eliminate our next target...

253
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,911
...while the Servants deal
with the monster?

254
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,665
Wait, Maiya.
That is no mere monster.

255
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,418
It's an immortal creature,
infinitely regenerative.

256
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,047
It will reach the shore
before it vanishes.

257
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,800
If it starts feeding, it's all over.

258
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,929
With a new source of mana,
Caster can sustain his material form.

259
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,598
Then the damage would only spread.

260
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,102
The Holy Grail War itself
may need to be abandoned.

261
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,646
That's correct.

262
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,983
But how do we eliminate
an immortal monster?

263
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,152
Our only option is to
destroy it all at once.

264
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,447
To destroy every single scrap of it,

265
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,659
...completely incinerating it
in a single strike.

266
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,579
Anti-personnel or anti-army
Noble Phantasms won't be enough.

267
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,498
We need an anti-fortress
Noble Phantasm.

268
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,626
And Saber...

269
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,587
...possesses one.

270
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,344
Unfortunately, Lancer's curse
leaves her unable to use it now.

271
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,556
I say...

272
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,684
...that we have them
show us this chivalry...

273
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,728
...that they are so proud of.

274
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,065
Episode 14:
The Mion River Battle

275
00:21:56,065 --> 00:22:01,863
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

276
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,909
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

277
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:15,960
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

278
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:23,092
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

279
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:30,975
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

280
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,897
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

281
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:41,819
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

282
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,824
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

283
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:51,871
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

284
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,793
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

285
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:04,384
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

286
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,928
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

287
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:11,891
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

288
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:18,439
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

289
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:24,404
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

290
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,492
This light...

291
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,701
Such a futile effort.

292
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,497
The undefeated king sings aloud the
name of the miracle held in her hands.

293
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,165
It is too painful to gaze upon.

294
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,417
Is he trying to
destroy himself?

295
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,584
We must stop him here!

296
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,087
Next Time: Golden Shine I shall
place my faith in you, Saber.
