1
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,234
Oceanus.

2
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,589
I have to ask, what brought this on?

3
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,340
We're going into town?

4
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,510
Nothing. I just want a change of scenery.

5
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,765
You've been whining about wanting to see the
amusement district this whole time, right?

6
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,394
The joy of window shopping
in a foreign land...

7
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,606
...is every bit as great
as the joy of battle.

8
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:08,861
I feel really bad for the countries that
got invaded for a reason like that.

9
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:13,491
What's up, kid? You sound like
you actually saw it happen.

10
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,911
Don't worry about it.
I was just thinking out loud.

11
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:37,223
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

12
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:43,354
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

13
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:49,735
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

14
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,408
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:02,623
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

16
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:10,297
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

17
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,592
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

18
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:16,595
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

20
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:28,190
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

21
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,944
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

22
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,742
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

23
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:44,832
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

24
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,932
This is horrible!
It's just too much!

25
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,606
We worked so hard to create
this artwork! How could they?

26
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,277
What kind... What kind of monster
would do this?!

27
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:26,999
Ryunosuke... only a very select few can
comprehend true beauty and harmony.

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,544
To the vast majority
of philistines,

29
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,839
...beauty is nothing but
something to be destroyed.

30
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:40,221
It is for that reason that we mustn't become
excessively attached to our creations.

31
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:45,392
All things that are given form
are fated to break one day.

32
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:49,188
We creators must rather find joy...

33
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,649
...in the process of creation.

34
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,694
Whatever they break, we should
make another, is that it?

35
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,698
Precisely! As always, Ryunosuke,

36
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,202
...your frank understanding is your best virtue.

37
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,878
Maybe we just had too much fun...

38
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,006
And God punished us.

39
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,844
I will say this, Ryunosuke.

40
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,014
God does not punish humans, ever!

41
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,016
He simply toys with them!

42
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,018
B-Big Guy?

43
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,189
Once, I committed atrocities...

44
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,025
...the likes of which this Earth
had never seen.

45
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,320
But each day I murdered,
and I defiled,

46
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,739
...and yet no divine
punishment came!

47
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,867
And before I knew it, my exploration
of the depths of evil...

48
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:47,413
...had been ignored
for eight whole years.

49
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,376
In the end, it was not God
that destroyed me,

50
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,754
...but rather the selfishness
of my fellow humans.

51
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,301
The church and state executed me,
not for any wrong I had done,

52
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:05,472
...but because they coveted
my wealth and lands!

53
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,310
What brought an end to my evil deeds
was the furthest thing possible from "judgment."

54
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,228
It was simple theft!

55
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,149
But, Big Guy...

56
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,070
There's still a God, right?

57
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,241
Why do you think that?

58
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,953
You, who are without faith and
have never known a miracle?

59
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,582
Because the world seems
like it's boring...

60
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:36,045
But the more you look, the more you find
all kinds of neat and crazy stuff!

61
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,172
I've always thought that way.

62
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,633
A world filled with
so many amazing things...

63
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,345
...could never have
happened by chance.

64
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,764
If you set your mind
to enjoying it,

65
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,267
...there's no better entertainment
than this world!

66
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:56,482
I'm sure there's an entertainer writing
the story of 5 billion people.

67
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,735
If you wanted to describe
somebody like that,

68
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,238
...what else could you call him
but God?

69
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:09,078
Then, Ryunosuke, do you think
that God loves humanity?

70
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,580
He's head over heels!

71
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:16,126
If he's spending every minute of every
day writing the story of this world,

72
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,921
...well, you could never
do that without love!

73
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,508
I bet he's totally into it!

74
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,053
While he enjoys his own work...

75
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:30,974
He loves the things that make humans
look good, like courage and hope!

76
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,397
And he loves screams
and blood and despair just as much!

77
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,902
If he didn't, there's no way
people's guts would be so colorful!

78
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,573
So I'm sure the world is
filled with God's love, Big Guy!

79
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,368
In this era where the people
no longer believe...

80
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,996
...and the state has
abandoned God's will,

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:59,545
...I had no idea that such a vivacious
new faith had taken root!

82
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,966
You have my admiration, Ryunosuke.
My Master!

83
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,010
Aww, cut it out!
I'm blushing.

84
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,347
But according to your
view of religion,

85
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,517
...were not all my blasphemies
nothing more than a farce?

86
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:21,191
Nah. You know, the best entertainers
can get smiles out of playing the villain.

87
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:27,364
If you ask me, I bet God just loves
playing against your villain routine!

88
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:40,544
So you say that both blasphemy
and devotion are worship in your eyes?

89
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,551
Ryunosuke! Truly, you are
the bearer of a new philosophy!

90
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,054
A God who makes puppets
of all men for his sport,

91
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,725
...and he himself is but another clown!

92
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,730
I see. His vicious ways
all make sense now.

93
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,732
Very well.

94
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,486
Then let us paint the gardens of God...

95
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,072
...with ever more brilliant despair and terror!

96
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,243
We will show the author in his Heaven...

97
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:18,749
...that God is not the only one who
knows what entertainment is!

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,377
We're gonna do something
awesome again, aren't we, big Guy?

99
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,881
Cool... Cool!

100
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,013
All right, I'll be in this
bookstore for a while.

101
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:40,062
As for you, do whatever you want,
but you're not to leave this arcade.

102
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,650
If I'm attacked,
it's curtains for you, too, got it?

103
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,614
No conquering. No plundering.

104
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,702
Pay attention to me, damn it!

105
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,542
There's to be no shoplifting,
and no eating without paying!

106
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,294
If you want something,
pay for it with money!

107
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,881
Or do I have to use a Command Seal
to make you behave?

108
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,678
Don't be rude.

109
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,806
Macedonian etiquette was the mark of...

110
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,642
...a man of culture in palaces everywhere!

111
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,103
Well, I'm off.
Until later, kid.

112
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:50,132
<i>The king gave control over
the lands he conquered,</i>

113
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,177
...as <i>well as the rights to their taxes,
to the local nobles,</i>

114
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,513
<i>...and took his armies further east.</i>

115
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,016
<i>Just like what I saw in my dream.</i>

116
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,477
<i>He continued his campaign...</i>

117
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,901
<i>...because he wanted to reach Oceanus,
the furthest ocean?</i>

118
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,993
Hey, kid, where are you?

119
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,832
There you are.

120
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,795
You're so small, you're impossible
to see between these bookshelves.

121
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,589
It was hard to find you.

122
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,301
Normal people are smaller
than bookshelves, idiot.

123
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,803
So, what did you buy?

124
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,555
Check this out.

125
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:43,268
<i>Admirable Grand Strategy came out today!</i>

126
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,270
And I got the first-run special edition!

127
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,192
My LUC must be pretty good!

128
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,071
You know, there's no point in
buying the software for that...

129
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,198
...if you don't have the game console.

130
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,575
I took care of it.

131
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,080
Come on, kid. When we get back,
we're playing two-player mode.

132
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,248
I bought us two controllers.

133
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:10,295
I'm not interested in low-class
entertainment like that.

134
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:18,095
Why do you always try to narrow
your own horizons like that?

135
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,473
Don't you ever want to seek out
anything fun?

136
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,933
Shut up.

137
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,646
If I have time to waste on that,
I'd rather spend it on the search for Truth.

138
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,608
So, what was so interesting
to you over here?

139
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,110
This book?

140
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,949
Hey... This is a book about me!

141
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,493
You're a weird guy.

142
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:47,457
I'm right here. If you want to know
something, just ask me to my face.

143
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,503
Fine, I'll ask! I'll ask you, then!

144
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,135
History says you were really short.

145
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,139
So why are you materializing
in such a huge body?

146
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,767
It says I'm tiny?

147
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,858
You can't trust books when you
don't know who wrote them.

148
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,989
You're not mad that it's wrong?

149
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,327
No, it doesn't really bother me.
Is that odd?

150
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,414
In any age, the people in charge...

151
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,376
...always try their hardest to make sure
future generations remember them.

152
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,006
I suppose having your name
recorded in the history books...

153
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,675
...is a kind of immortality.

154
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,553
But if that just means that
my name gets passed down...

155
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,764
...for 2,000 years
and nothing else does,

156
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,141
...I'd have preferred to have...

157
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,644
...even a hundredth of that
added to my life.

158
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,691
Then is it true that you died
in your early 30s?

159
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,903
Yes, that one's true.

160
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,660
Hey, Big Guv!

161
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:12,209
Get out there and show us something
that's gonna shock even God!

162
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,169
Big Guv!

163
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,380
Look forward to it, Ryunosuke!

164
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:21,301
I shall give you the greatest
"Cool!" you have ever seen!

165
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,094
Seriously?

166
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,306
I can't wait!

167
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,906
Something awesome's gonna happen!

168
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,673
Why are you so quiet?

169
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,679
Nothing. I was just thinking
how boring you were.

170
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:10,141
What? I knew it, you're bored!

171
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,561
Then quit your whining
and play this game with me.

172
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,229
That's not it!

173
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:19,526
Even if I get the Grail for a Servant like you,
who's practically guaranteed to win,

174
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,113
...I couldn't take pride in that at all.

175
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:28,577
It would've been better if
my pact had been with Assassin!

176
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,747
I don't know if that would've worked.

177
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,417
I think you'd be dead.

178
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,210
That's fine!

179
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,589
If I'm going to die in my own battle,
then I'm not going to complain.

180
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,301
That's why I joined the Grail War.

181
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,302
And now...

182
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,930
I don't know what to tell you.

183
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:54,185
If the wish you have for the Grail
was something that impressed me,

184
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:59,482
...I would be more inclined to obey you.

185
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,488
But if you just want to
use it to get taller...

186
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,741
You don't know what you're talking about!

187
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,201
You don't need to be in such a hurry.

188
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:16,082
Nobody said that the Grail War would be
the most important event of your life.

189
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,584
What?

190
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:23,715
When the day comes that you find a way
to live that you can truly be proud of,

191
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,596
...you'll be forced into your own battle
whether you want to or not.

192
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,309
You'll have plenty of time to look
for your battlefield then.

193
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,397
I'm not the only one who isn't
satisfied with this pact, am I?

194
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,526
You don't like it either!

195
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,446
Having me as your Master.

196
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,366
You would've been able
to win a lot easier...

197
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,701
...if you'd contracted with
a different Master, right?

198
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,372
Probably, yeah.

199
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,219
Take a look, kid.

200
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,638
This is the enemy I'm facing.

201
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:17,644
Now, try to draw us standing
alongside this enemy.

202
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,106
So that you can compare the two of us.

203
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,732
But that's...

204
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,567
Impossible, right?

205
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,613
Next to the enemy we're about
to fight, you and I are the same.

206
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,157
Just little dots.

207
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,244
What point is there
in comparing our size?

208
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,248
That is exactly why I am so excited!

209
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,501
The weakest, the smallest, that's perfect!

210
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:47,799
With a body smaller than a poppy seed,
I will someday surpass the world!

211
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:54,264
In my chest beats the heart
of the King of Conquerors!

212
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,269
So what you're saying is, who your
Master is makes no difference, right?

213
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,650
No matter how weak I am,
it doesn't matter to you.

214
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,695
Where'd you get that?

215
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,994
That miserable nature of yours
is the sign of a conqueror.

216
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:21,708
No matter what you say,
you know how small you are.

217
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:27,922
And yet you still struggle to reach
heights greater than you can imagine.

218
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,634
That's not a compliment.
You're making fun of me.

219
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,806
Indeed, kid. You're an incorrigible idiot.

220
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,352
Your desires are greater than yourself.

221
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,397
Like they say,
"Glory lies beyond the horizon."

222
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:48,651
In the world I lived in, that was
the most basic rule of life.

223
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,906
Is that why you kept rushing
towards the east like a fool?

224
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,033
Yes. That's right.

225
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,244
I wanted to see Oceanus
with my own eyes.

226
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,581
But my dream never came true.

227
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,502
<i>He doesn't see that sea?</i>

228
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:12,300
Even now, Oceanus remains
the place I strive for.

229
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,427
It's an endless dream.

230
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:20,850
<i>That sea is the mental image
that Rider has of it.</i>

231
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,644
Laugh if you like.

232
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:29,025
I, who still dream the same dream after
2,000 years, am another great fool.

233
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,694
So, kid...

234
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:36,157
A pact with an idiot like you
feels perfect for me.

235
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,290
The river.

236
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,548
Can you see what is happening, Lancer?

237
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,050
It is Caster, all right.

238
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,220
He has taken up a position on the river
and appears to be doing something.

239
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,306
However, I cannot make out what, exactly.

240
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,685
This is the perfect opportunity
to put him down.

241
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,145
Indeed.

242
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,983
<i>If I defeat Caster,</i>

243
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,695
...I <i>can regain one of the bonds
with Lancer that I lost.</i>

244
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,658
I will go forth to engage him.
You stay here, Mistress Sola-Ui...

245
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,952
...and bear witness to my deeds.

246
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,662
What?

247
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,291
I'm a Master now! I will stay
by your side and assist you.

248
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,625
You mustn't.

249
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,754
You could not possibly understand
military matters as Master Kayneth did.

250
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,426
That river will become a deathtrap.
Please understand.

251
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,595
But I...

252
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,931
Or is it that you still harbor doubts...

253
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,268
...as to where the loyalty of Diarmuid lies?

254
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,937
That he would fight to serve his own ends?

255
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,612
Lancer, I leave all
field decisions to you.

256
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,823
Fight freely, and without regret.

257
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,450
I am in your debt.

258
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,542
If you return victorious,

259
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,172
...Lancer, grace me with your smile.

260
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,191
Caster...

261
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,612
This incredible outpouring of mana...

262
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,616
...makes it clear that Caster is in
the process of some incredible magic.

263
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,917
Welcome, Holy Virgin.

264
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,921
I am overjoyed that we have met again.

265
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,008
You never learn, fiend.
What are you trying to do tonight?

266
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:04,681
I'm terribly sorry, Jeanne. But you're
not the guest of honor tonight.

267
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,601
But if you would care to join us,

268
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:12,438
...it would give me the greatest pleasure.

269
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:18,903
At this banquet of death and decadence
that I, Gilles de Rais, have prepared,

270
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,114
...everyone may eat their fill!

271
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:29,163
Now we once again raise
the flag of salvation!

272
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,503
Caster is being absorbed?

273
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,798
You who have been
abandoned, gather here!

274
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,760
I shall lead you! I shall rule you!

275
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,680
The resentment and rage
of we, the oppressed,

276
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,891
...shall reach unto God himself!

277
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:55,398
God in Heaven, with words of condemnation,
I praise Your holy name!

278
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,191
That's...

279
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,986
O Arrogant God!

280
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,988
O Cruel God!

281
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,117
We shall pull you down
from your throne!

282
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,419
Hey, King of Knights.

283
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,962
King of Conquerors...

284
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,424
Hey, stop it. We're calling
a truce for the night.

285
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:27,221
We won't be able to have any kind of
fight unless we deal with that thing.

286
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:30,099
I've been going around
and telling everyone.

287
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,103
Lancer agreed. He should be here soon.

288
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,109
Understood. We have no objections
to fighting alongside you, either.

289
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,613
King of Conquerors, ours will be a short alliance,
but let us pledge loyalty to one another.

290
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,866
Einzbern, you guys got a plan?

291
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:51,621
Lancer told me that this isn't
your first time fighting Caster.

292
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,083
We need to defeat him
as quickly as we can.

293
00:22:55,166 --> 00:23:00,296
That monster is maintaining itself in
this world with Caster's mana for now,

294
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,757
...but if it gets its own food source
and starts to become self-sustaining,

295
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,467
...there'll be nothing we can do.

296
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,260
We must stop Caster before then.

297
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:13,142
I follow you. We need to settle this
before it comes ashore and starts to feed.

298
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:18,940
But Caster himself is deep inside
those thick walls of flesh.

299
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,150
What do we do?

300
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,487
Drag him out. That's the only way.

301
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,783
If we can expose his Noble Phantasm,

302
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:33,037
...then my Gae Dearg can destroy
the spell with one strike.

303
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,498
Lancer, will you be able
to throw that spear...

304
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,542
...through his Noble Phantasm
from the shore?

305
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,838
If I can just see it, it will be child's play.

306
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,216
Then you and I will act as the advance guard.

307
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,051
Is that acceptable, King of Conquerors?

308
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:51,931
That's fine. My chariot
has no need of roads,

309
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,893
...but how are you going to attack
the enemy in the river, Saber?

310
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,605
My body has been blessed by
the Lady of the Lake.

311
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,484
No water can bar my way,
however many fathoms deep it may be.

312
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,029
That's a rare skill to have.

313
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,616
I want you to serve under me
even more now.

314
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,703
You will pay for your words some other time.

315
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:18,291
But for now, we need to drag Caster
out from within that monster.

316
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,460
Indeed!

317
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,796
Then I shall take the lead!

318
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,681
Saber... Good luck.

319
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,909
Let's finish this, Caster!

320
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,707
Episode 13:
The Forbidden Feast

321
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:07,924
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

322
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:16,766
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

323
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:31,781
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

324
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:39,997
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

325
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:49,131
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

326
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:55,471
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

327
00:25:55,972 --> 00:26:04,146
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

328
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:11,028
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

329
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:19,161
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

330
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:27,587
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

331
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,758
Get 'em, Bluebeard!

332
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,094
A failure of these proportions
is unprecedented.

333
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,888
You want me to unleash my
greatest treasure, Ea, here?

334
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:38,723
Saber!

335
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,349
King of Heroes, please, wait!

336
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,809
What a crazy guy.

337
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,770
Kill all of them! Every last one!
