1
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,636
Kerry! Kerry!

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,138
Hurry UP!

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,640
Hurry up! Hurry UP!

4
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,225
Kerry!

5
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,417
Wow! Amazing!

6
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,837
Nah... That was nothing!

7
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,381
Shirley...

8
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,632
Shirley!

9
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:49,633
Kerry!

10
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,594
Sorry I'm late.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,683
Say, Kerry...

12
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,519
Do you know where this island's
name comes from?

13
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,771
Nope.

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,441
Oh, isn't Arimago the
word for "crab"?

15
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,734
Yup.

16
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,280
Long ago, this was a place where they
made offerings to the sea gods.

17
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,786
But one day, a girl who had nothing
to feed her sick mother...

18
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,164
...took some of the food that
had been set out as an offering.

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:26,170
And so the girl was cursed,
transformed into a crab.

20
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,173
That's where it comes from?
What an awful story.

21
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,469
And they say the shrine where
they worshipped those gods...

22
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:38,057
...stood up in the mountains,
right where your mansion is.

23
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,436
That's why none of the villagers
want to go up there.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,480
They say it's bad luck.

25
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:49,318
They keep trying to spook me, too, saying that
if I go there too often, I'll be cursed.

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,611
You're kidding.

27
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,656
But everyone's nice to me.

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,701
Because they don't think of you
as an outsider anymore.

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,747
In the village, they treat you
like my little brother.

30
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,957
Oh...

31
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,293
Little brother, huh?

32
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:10,381
You've really settled in here.

33
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,382
Yeah?

34
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,261
When you first arrived,
everyone used to bully you,

35
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,179
...saying you had a weird name!

36
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,681
That?

37
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,351
You were the first one to use it!

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,521
And it was your big idea
to call me Kerry...

39
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,192
Because your name's
really hard to say!

40
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,028
Keri... Keri...

41
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,364
It's Kiritsugu.

42
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,532
Kerytugu!

43
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,534
Not even close...

44
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,702
Oops.

45
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,953
Really?

46
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,842
Okay.

47
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,388
Dad, is that new?

48
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,015
Yes.

49
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,893
This is my hundredth success.

50
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,566
These flowers never wither.

51
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,903
Yes, because I've altered
the flow of time.

52
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,907
They'll never grow beyond this.
But they'll also never wither.

53
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,034
Amazing...

54
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,622
The problem is whether we can get the same
theory to work on humans.

55
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,377
Sorry for the wait!

56
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,797
Shirley, is that a--

57
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,927
Look!
My first success!

58
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,388
Shirley's been watching and learning
while she assists me.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,270
She does seem to have the natural gift
to be a mage.

60
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,899
Oh, come on, you did
most of the work, Professor.

61
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,610
I only did a little,
right at the end.

62
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,612
But it's amazing!

63
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,530
Hey, Dad...

64
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,782
Hmm? What?

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,786
Can I also give that a try?
What Shirley did?

66
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,746
That'd be great!

67
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,124
If you had some help,
you could do it!

68
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,126
- Right, Professor?
- No.

69
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,464
Kiritsugu.
It's still too early for you.

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,635
This isn't a game.
There are dangers involved.

71
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:25,808
I only let Shirley try it because I decided she
has the necessary knowledge and experience.

72
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,951
Father Simon,
why won't you understand?

73
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,202
Shirley...

74
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,330
Everyone has the Professor all wrong!

75
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,541
Listen, Shirley...

76
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,419
Stop going to that mansion.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,424
Let's talk inside.

78
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,683
Dad should spend time
with the villagers, too.

79
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,687
Maybe...

80
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,358
Father Simon really
has it in for him.

81
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,695
He keeps lecturing me
all the time.

82
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,074
He says if I keep working there,
I'll get possessed by a demon someday.

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,868
Look at this.

84
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:30,205
He gave me this and told me
to keep it near me at all times.

85
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,335
He says that it's a
powerful talisman.

86
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,715
Aren't you scared of
my dad, Shirley?

87
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,591
Nope.

88
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,846
Sure, magical research
isn't exactly normal.

89
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:51,894
But the Professor's research and discoveries
are a big deal! They could make history!

90
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,147
I'm not scared of him,
I think he's amazing.

91
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,737
Are you sure you--

92
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,158
It's sharp and really
easy to use.

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,912
See you tomorrow.

94
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,041
Shirley, is something wrong?

95
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,670
Making a flower bloom forever...

96
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,756
It really is an amazing magic.

97
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,300
Shirley, you're doing it, too.

98
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,969
The work with flowers
is all I can do.

99
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,181
He can do a lot more.

100
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,894
Medicines he makes could make humans
effectively immortal.

101
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,773
I want him to use his power for
the good of the whole world...

102
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:42,194
...so everyone will understand
how incredible he is.

103
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,780
He's given up on that.

104
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,034
But, Kerry,
I think you can do it.

105
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,497
Oh, come on.
You're his best student.

106
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,250
If anyone can do that,
it'd be you.

107
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,334
Not me.

108
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,798
I'm not his student.
At best, I'm his assistant.

109
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,634
Running his errands.
Helping out.

110
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,808
I'm not his student.
Far from it.

111
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,145
So even when Father Simon
says bad things about him,

112
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,813
...there's nothing I can say.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,481
Kerry.

114
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,818
You're his heir, without doubt.

115
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:28,824
Everything he's working on,
he plans for you to continue.

116
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,828
It's just a little too soon.

117
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,416
Hey, come with me.

118
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,777
Kerry, what kind of person do you want
to be when you grow up?

119
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:12,034
If you take up your dad's work,
what will you use it for?

120
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,287
It's a power that can
change the world.

121
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,040
And one day,
it will be yours.

122
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,212
Yeah, change the world.
You can do it.

123
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,172
I guarantee it.

124
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,883
Well, I...

125
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,136
That's a secret.

126
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:42,481
Then, when you grow up,
let me see what you can do.

127
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,652
I'll stay with you until then.

128
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,904
Okay?

129
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,579
Wh-Whatever...

130
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,294
Stop it!

131
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,587
Gotcha!

132
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,515
Oh, good morning, Dad.

133
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,353
Kiritsugu, you didn't enter my workshop
last night, did you?

134
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,022
Nope.

135
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,691
You didn't?

136
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,196
Kiritsugu, don't go to
the village today.

137
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,241
Don't leave the house.

138
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,288
What's gotten into him?

139
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,045
Shirley's late...

140
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,309
Hey.

141
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,228
Have you guys seen Shirley?

142
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,238
Shirley?

143
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,540
Shirley?

144
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,690
What happened to you?

145
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,590
Kerry...

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,717
Shirley!

147
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,266
I...

148
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,687
I only wanted to prove it worked!

149
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,773
His research...

150
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,609
But...

151
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,070
I guess...

152
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,614
It didn't work...

153
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,084
Kill me.

154
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,089
Use that. Please...

155
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,341
You have to kill me.

156
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:02,431
Do it now,
before it's too late...

157
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,101
Please!

158
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,311
I can't stop it...

159
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,523
I can't hold it back anymore!

160
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,442
Hurry!

161
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,125
Are you sure it was Shirley?

162
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,635
Kerry, stay here for now.

163
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,888
I'll go inform the village.

164
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,271
Wh-What is this?

165
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,833
Father Simon?

166
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,185
Looks like I'm too late.

167
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,770
W-Wait!

168
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,855
Who are you?

169
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,572
Shouldn't you worry
about yourself first?

170
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:53,828
Well, if you just sit there,
you'll join them soon enough.

171
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,630
What happened? What's going on?

172
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,465
Who did this?

173
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,509
Why would they burn the village?

174
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,512
Surely you've heard of them...

175
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,681
Vampires.

176
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,059
We call them Dead Apostles.

177
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,602
Dead Apostles?

178
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,605
They drink blood to
increase their numbers.

179
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,484
Nearly everyone on this
island is one now.

180
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,612
So we're cleaning up the mess.

181
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:32,826
Two groups are down there now,
trying to eliminate them.

182
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,162
One is the Church's Executors.

183
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,708
People who believe beyond the shadow of a doubt
that it's all right to slaughter anyone...

184
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,584
...who defies the will of God.

185
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,838
Of course, they'll show no mercy
to any Dead Apostles they find.

186
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,050
They'll kill anyone they even suspect
of having had their blood sucked.

187
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,556
As for the other, the Mages Association...
Well, they're harder to explain.

188
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:59,227
But they'd like to keep the
secret of who made...

189
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,355
...such a bizarre thing as the
Dead Apostles all to themselves.

190
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,984
Naturally, since their motto
is "All to Ourselves,"

191
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,279
...they'll kill anyone they suspect
of knowing the secret.

192
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,073
They'll do whatever they can
to cover up what happened.

193
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,367
They're the ones who
torched the village.

194
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,621
Whose side are you on?

195
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,084
I'm something like a salesman
to the Mages Association.

196
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,004
Now, kid...

197
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,256
Answer my question.

198
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,551
I'm looking for a mage who's
been marked for sealing.

199
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,595
A mage...

200
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,307
I guess that word doesn't
mean anything to you.

201
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,102
The first person to become
a Dead Apostle here...

202
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,148
There's a... Think of it as a medium that
makes people turn into Dead Apostles.

203
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,734
A trigger that causes them
to transform.

204
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,571
The bad mage who made it
should be hiding,

205
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,407
...somewhere on this island.

206
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,577
Can you think of
any likely spots?

207
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,055
Oh, Kiritsugu... You're safe.

208
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,640
Thank goodness.

209
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,267
I told you not to go
to the village.

210
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,356
Dad...
Why were you researching Dead Apostles?

211
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,317
Kiritsugu, how did you--

212
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,072
Shirley used the magic
on herself.

213
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,783
Oh...

214
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,577
Well, it's very sad.

215
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,288
But you can't change the past.

216
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,042
This just means that Shirley gave me
my answer sooner than I had expected.

217
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:52,298
Dad, will you use me like
you used Shirley one day?

218
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,050
Don't be stupid.

219
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,804
A Dead Apostle that can't control
its bloodlust is a failure.

220
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,725
But the Emiya family research
requires unlimited time.

221
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,729
The Root will never be attained
with a mortal body.

222
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,482
It was a time-consuming experiment,

223
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,110
...but it seems to have failed.

224
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,530
I'll have to reconsider
my theory in its entirety.

225
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,993
Kiritsugu, let's save this
matter for another time.

226
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,203
For now, escaping comes first.

227
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,373
It's not too late to escape?

228
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,918
I suspected something like this
might happen,

229
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,962
...so I hid a motorboat
on the south coast.

230
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,466
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu,

231
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,052
...but I don't have time to let
you gather your things.

232
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,429
Come on.

233
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,014
I'll do it.

234
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,474
There's a bounded field
around the forest.

235
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,935
A powerful one.

236
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,813
It'll take time to break through.

237
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,900
But I can get in.

238
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,985
I have to do this.

239
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,926
<i>Kerry/</i>

240
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,015
<i>...what kind of person do you want
to be when you grow up?</i>

241
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:55,296
I was able to break through that
bounded field fairly easily.

242
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,800
Are you mad?

243
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,179
It was only dumb luck
that you showed up in time.

244
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:08,101
If this man had escaped, he'd have continued
his Dead Apostles research somewhere else.

245
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,106
That's a crappy reason for
a kid to kill his father.

246
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,444
You're a good person, aren't you?

247
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,156
I'll get you off the island.

248
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,534
You can decide the
rest for yourself.

249
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,995
Do you want to take anything?

250
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,039
Nothing.

251
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:48,516
Shizuka ni matataku Hoshi tachi no chiriyuku sora
In the sky where stars twinkle quietly,

252
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,062
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

253
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,065
Episode 18: Distant Memories
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

254
00:21:56,065 --> 00:22:00,445
Todokanu inori ga Ten to chi wo mitashiteta
unheeded prayers fill the heavens and the Earth.

255
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,118
Hosoi eda ni hikaru no wa
What you see shining on that slender branch

256
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,621
Saki wasureta mirai
is a future that forgot to bloom.

257
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:18,212
Mada nagori oshisouni tsubomi wo otoshita
It sheds its flower buds, as if unwilling to let go.

258
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:22,258
Hora mou toki wa michite
Look, the time has come.

259
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:29,682
Minoru kin no kajitsu Sono te de tsumitoru dake de
All you need to do is pluck that ripe, golden fruit

260
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,519
Sekai wa owaru kara
to end the world.

261
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:41,027
Kegarenu mono toshite furu yuki no shirosa wa
The pure white of the snow, falling
from the sky as something unsullied,

262
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,409
Nukumori wo shireba kiete shimau no
will vanish the instant it knows warmth.

263
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:55,375
Kirei na yume dake ga anata wo kirisaita
Only beautiful dreams sliced you.

264
00:22:55,458 --> 00:23:03,508
Tsumetai hitomi no yasashisa to shinjitsu
The kindness and truth of cold eyes.

265
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:11,015
Hageshiku matataku hoshi tachi wa ten ni somuite
Harshly twinkling stars defy the heavens

266
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:18,606
Adanasu inori ga Kono sora wo otosu
bring down the sky.

267
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,450
After leaving the island, I spent
the next several years...

268
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:33,955
...with Natalia Kaminski, the woman
who took me away from there.

269
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,084
That meant choosing the
same path as Natalia.

270
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,087
The path of a hunter.
