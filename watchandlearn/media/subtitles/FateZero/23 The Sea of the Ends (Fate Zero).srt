1
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,569
Rider, look.

2
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,956
Are you scared, boy?

3
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,584
Yeah. I'm scared.

4
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:47,590
Or maybe this is what you mean
when you say your heart is dancing.

5
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,012
It seems you're starting
to understand.

6
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>The enemy is inside?</i>

7
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,253
Berserker?

8
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,073
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

9
00:01:54,156 --> 00:02:00,037
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

10
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:06,335
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

11
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:11,298
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

12
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:19,140
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

13
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,434
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

14
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:28,649
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

15
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,821
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

16
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,157
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

17
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:41,036
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,206
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

19
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,584
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

20
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:53,340
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

21
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,394
<i>They're going to drink here?</i>

22
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,397
Where is your little chariot
that you are proud of?

23
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,733
Well...

24
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,030
I'm embarrassed to say
that I lost it to Saber.

25
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,657
Did you forget my decision?

26
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,410
I believe I told you that
I would defeat you...

27
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,412
...when you were at full strength.

28
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,625
True, the weapons at my disposal
are somewhat depleted.

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,006
But Iskandar tonight is less than perfect,
and thus, is greater than perfection.

30
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,717
So I see.

31
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,762
Indeed, the aura that
is emanating from you...

32
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,764
it is unusually potent.

33
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:48,896
It appears that you have come before me
believing that you have a chance of victory.

34
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,035
King of Babylonia, a final word.

35
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,287
Our banquet's last question.

36
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,414
I shall allow it. Speak.

37
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,713
Purely hypothetically, were my Ionian Hetairoi
armed with your Gate of Babylon,

38
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,800
...it would create the most
powerful army imaginable.

39
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,302
What of it?

40
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,806
Would you not ally
yourself with me?

41
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:29,270
Together, the two of us could
conquer the very stars.

42
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,526
You never cease to amuse me.

43
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:41,323
It has been ages since I laughed so hard at
gibberish spouted by one who is not a fool.

44
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,410
But unfortunately,

45
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,330
...I have had but one comrade,
and he is all I shall ever have.

46
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,501
And there is no need
for two kings.

47
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,170
The lonely path of kingship, eh?

48
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,551
I shall challenge your unwavering
spirit with respect.

49
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,303
Very well.

50
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,723
Show me what you can do,
King of Conquerors.

51
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,810
You are a usurper
worthy of my judgment.

52
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,201
Are you guys actually friends?

53
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,413
I could hardly be unfriendly to him.

54
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,752
He may well be the last
person I ever see.

55
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,799
Don't be stupid...
You can't be killed!

56
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,011
I won't allow it!
Have you forgotten my Command Seal?

57
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,639
You're right...

58
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,060
You're exactly right!

59
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,608
To me, my comrades!

60
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:02,738
Tonight, we become the
greatest legend in history!

61
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:23,592
Our enemy is the mighty
King of Heroes, a worthy opponent!

62
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,096
My warriors, let us show
the very first Heroic Spirit...

63
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,933
...our path of conquest!

64
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,075
Come to me, lord of
conquering armies.

65
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,579
Now you will behold the
sight of a true king.

66
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,717
Why are you suffering so much?

67
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:54,349
Because Berserker...
must fight...

68
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,435
Why?

69
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,315
Because that priest said so.

70
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,650
That priest?

71
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,196
Yeah... He promised me.

72
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,698
That he'd give me the Grail.

73
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,370
If I have the Grail,
I can save you.

74
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,040
You're going to save me?

75
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,503
Yeah, I promised you, remember?

76
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:27,716
That we'd all play together...
like we used to.

77
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,554
Then... I'll be able to see Mom again, right?

78
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,224
Mom...

79
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,475
<i>NOW!</i>

80
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,106
<i>I barely scratched him?</i>

81
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,287
<i>Can he see it?</i>

82
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,136
<i>He knows the length of my blade...</i>

83
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,639
<i>Could he be some knight
I once knew?</i>

84
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,479
From your skill, I assume you to be a knight
of some renown, and so I ask you this:

85
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,027
If you know me to be
Arturia Pendragon, King of Britain,

86
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,615
...name yourself,
as a knight's pride demands!

87
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:19,161
Challenging me with your identity concealed
is tantamount to attacking using deceit!

88
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,170
You are...

89
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,183
N-No...

90
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,147
Arondight?

91
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,858
You can't be...

92
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,112
Arthur...

93
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,462
Sir Lancelot...

94
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,350
Why, my friend?

95
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,563
You were esteemed as the greatest of
the Knights of the Round Table! Why, then?

96
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,858
How could you fall so low
as to become Berserker--

97
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,238
Lancelot?

98
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,744
Lancelot...

99
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,590
<i>You saved them,
but you never led them.</i>

100
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,010
Because I never led them...

101
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,390
<i>Enraptured by a false idol of
the king who serves others...</i>

102
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,267
My ideals...

103
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,935
My kingship...

104
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,520
<i>Only a little girl.</i>

105
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,481
Did they drive you to this?!

106
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,281
Arthur!

107
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,867
Lancelot...

108
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,129
To unite dreams beneath
a banner of conquest.

109
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,256
I praise your efforts at least.

110
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,012
But, warriors...
Did you not learn?

111
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,517
That all dreams must disappear
when the dreamer wakes.

112
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,312
Every last one of them.

113
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:17,964
Therefore, it was inevitable that
I would stand in your way,

114
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,509
...King of Conquerors.

115
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,346
Now, know the end
of your eternal dream.

116
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,849
I, myself, shall show
you harsh reality.

117
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,352
Here it comes!

118
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,773
Now awaken, Ea!

119
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,609
A stage worthy of you
has been set!

120
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,365
Look up and behold...
Enuma Elish!

121
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,787
Hang on, boy!

122
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,383
That...

123
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:13,770
That sword is the anti-planet
Noble Phantasm that can destroy all creation?

124
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,443
Rider...

125
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:11,453
Come to think of it,
there is something I must ask you.

126
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,958
Waver Velvet,

127
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,836
...would you like to serve
as my retainer?

128
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,471
You...

129
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,475
You are my king...

130
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,811
I will serve you.
I will devote myself to you.

131
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,481
Please lead me...

132
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,485
Let me dream your dream!

133
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,072
Very well.

134
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,124
As king, my duty is to inspire
others to dream.

135
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:03,546
And as my retainer, it is your task
to see my dream to the end,

136
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,049
...and to speak of it to
future generations.

137
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,515
Live, Waver.

138
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,809
See all of this to the end.

139
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,436
Live long, and tell everyone.

140
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,314
Of how your king comported himself!

141
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,025
Of the charge of Iskandar!

142
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,203
Now... Let us go, Bucephalus!

143
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,958
Rider!

144
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,711
<i>Glory lies beyond the horizon...</i>

145
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,963
<i>Challenge it because you know
it to be unattainable.</i>

146
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,341
<i>Speak of conquest,
and make it real.</i>

147
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,553
<i>For my men,
who watch behind me!</i>

148
00:17:55,742 --> 00:18:02,540
I swear... It's one strange toy
after another with you, isn't it?

149
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,633
Have you awakened from your dream,
King of Conquerors?

150
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,391
I suppose I have...

151
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:26,314
My heart danced a good deal...

152
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,944
...during this campaign...

153
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,077
Feel free to challenge me again as many
times as you like, King of Conquerors.

154
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,335
This entire world is my garden
until the end of time.

155
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,712
Thus, I guarantee you this.

156
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,300
It will never bore you.

157
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,603
I am glad to hear it...

158
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,697
<i>Now I see...</i>

159
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,033
<i>It was the beating of my heart...</i>

160
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:23,371
<i>...that was the sound of
Okeanos' waves...</i>

161
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,741
Child... Are you Rider's Master?

162
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,704
No... I am his retainer...

163
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,751
I see.

164
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,506
But then, child,
if you are truly loyal to him,

165
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,010
...your duty is to avenge
your fallen king.

166
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,556
If I challenge you, I will die.

167
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,600
Of course.

168
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,102
I can't do that.

169
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,481
I was ordered to survive.

170
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,578
Your loyalty is splendid!

171
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,790
Never tarnish it.

172
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:11,604
<i>He restores my soul. He leads me in paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.</i>

173
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,694
<i>Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,</i>

174
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,448
<i>...for You are with me;</i>

175
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,035
<i>...Your rod and Your staff--</i>

176
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,037
<i>...they comfort me.</i>

177
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,416
<i>You prepare a table before me in
the presence of my enemies;</i>

178
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,460
<i>...You anoint my head with oil.</i>

179
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,838
<i>My cup overflows.</i>

180
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.</i>

181
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,677
<i>My cup overflows.</i>

182
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:47,223
<i>Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.</i>

183
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,024

What are you doing, Saber?!

201
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,452
What a difficult person you are...

202

Impossible!
