1
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,411
Irisviel.

2
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:39,874
Are you all right?

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,254
They waited for Kiritsugu to leave
before launching a frontal assault.

4
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,092
That lightning, and this frontal assault...

5
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,135
The enemy is likely...

6
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,429
Rider.

7
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:13,282
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

8
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:19,413
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

9
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:25,795
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

10
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:32,510
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

11
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:38,682
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

12
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:46,357
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

13
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,652
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

14
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,696
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

15
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,619
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

16
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,250
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

17
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,045
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

18
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,802
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

19
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:20,891
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

20
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,859
Whoa!

21
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,992
Hey, Saber!

22
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,454
Rider?

23
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:46,208
I came because
I wanted to see your castle.

24
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,878
It's kind of gloomy,
don't you think?

25
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:54,216
And what's with that armor?

26
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,512
You aren't wearing
your fashionable suit tonight?

27
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,473
Rider, what are you doing here?

28
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,767
Can't you tell?

29
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,315
I've come to drink. What else?

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,235
Stop standing there,
and show me around.

31
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:17,323
Surely you have a garden here
suitable for a banquet.

32
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,076
Really, this castle is too dusty.

33
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:42,223
The Holy Grail is said to be fated for
the hands of the one most worthy of it.

34
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:48,437
And the battle here in Fuyuki
will determine who that person is.

35
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,440
If it's simply a means to decide,

36
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,776
...then there's hardly cause for bloodshed.

37
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:58,447
If all the Heroic Spirits can be
satisfied with our ranking,

38
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,450
...then the matter will settle itself.

39
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,794
Oh?

40
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,800
Then first, you wish to compare
your rank against my own, Rider?

41
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,219
Indeed.

42
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,263
As one who also lays claim
to the title of king,

43
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,473
...you cannot refuse this opportunity.

44
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,769
You might consider this a Grail Dialogue,
rather than a Grail War.

45
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,898
The matter of which among us is
most suited to claim the Grail...

46
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,612
...will become clear as we drink.

47
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,451
That is quite enough nonsense,

48
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,454
...mongrels.

49
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
Archer, what is your business here?

50
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,629
Ah, I saw him in town,

51
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,173
...so I figured I might as well invite him.

52
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,884
You're late, Goldie.

53
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,555
Well, I suppose it stands to reason.
You travel by foot, unlike myself.

54
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,476
So you chose to hold a banquet of
kings in this depressing place?

55
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:13,897
How will you recompense me
for the rudeness of calling me here?

56
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,233
Lighten up.

57
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,236
Here, start with a drink.

58
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,289
What is this cheap swill?

59
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,418
You really thought we could discern
a hierarchy of Heroic Spirits with this?

60
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,170
You don't like it?

61
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,549
This was among the best I found
at the city marketplace.

62
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,179
You can believe it is because
you are ignorant of true drink.

63
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,722
Stupid mongrel.

64
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,526
Behold, and acknowledge your folly.

65
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,945
This is the drink of a king!

66
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,656
A fine treasure indeed.

67
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,670
Magnificent!

68
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:25,469
My treasury houses only
the finest drink and the finest of swords.

69
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,435
This alone should indicate which
among us is the greatest of kings.

70
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,437
Archer.

71
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:40,401
Your finest drink is, indeed,
worthy of the finest vessel.

72
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,737
Unfortunately, the Holy Grail
is not a drinking cup.

73
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:50,327
First, we must hear what wish
you would have the Grail grant.

74
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,204
You are not ruler here, mongrel.

75
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,499
Already, you violate the rules...

76
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,876
...dictating that we must fight for the Grail.

77
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,590
To begin with, the Grail
already belongs to me.

78
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,509
All of this world's treasures,
without exception,

79
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,137
...trace their origin to my treasure house.

80
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,141
Then you once held the Grail?

81
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,643
You would know it by sight?

82
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,811
No.

83
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,230
Do not consider me as
you would some lesser being.

84
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,776
The amount of wealth in my treasury
long ago surpassed my own knowledge.

85
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,281
But that it is a treasure also
means that it belongs to me.

86
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,741
And any who would take it
for themselves...

87
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,662
...is naught but a thief.

88
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:38,417
Your words are no different than
Caster's insane rants.

89
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,129
It appears he isn't the only Servant
to have gone mad.

90
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,965
Come, let's not go that far...

91
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,430
I believe I've got a clue to
what Goldie's real name is.

92
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,515
So, Archer...

93
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,978
You suggest that if we desire the Grail,
we must get your permission first?

94
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,188
Indeed.

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,818
However, there is no reason whatsoever
for me to reward mongrels of your ilk.

96
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,197
Wait a minute...
You're gonna keep it for yourself?

97
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,239
Fool.

98
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,494
My magnanimity is limited to
my vassals and my people.

99
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,123
In which case, Rider, if you were
to swear fealty to me,

100
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,170
...I could lend you a grail or two
whenever you felt the need for one.

101
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,381
Sorry, I'm afraid that's
out of the question!

102
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,803
But, Archer, surely you have no special
interest in the Grail itself, do you?

103
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,888
Of course not.

104
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,557
But I must render my judgment...

105
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,976
...to those who would steal
treasure from me.

106
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,395
It's a matter of principle.

107
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,857
So then, Archer...

108
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,028
On what morals and reasoning
are these principles based?

109
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,029
It is the law.

110
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,783
My law, which I set down
as king.

111
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,743
Perfect.

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,247
To live according to one's own law
is the epitome of kingship.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,672
But still, I want the Grail
so badly I can taste it!

114
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,425
It's my style to take what I want.

115
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:16,056
After all, Iskandar is the
King of Conquerors, is he not?

116
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,308
Right and wrong do not enter into it.

117
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,103
You break the law, and I punish you.

118
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,689
There is no place for discussion.

119
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:30,445
Which means that
all we have left to us is combat.

120
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:37,327
So, Archer! Would you like
to finish this off?

121
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,788
There will be plenty of time to
kill one another afterwards.

122
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,457
Of course. Or do you dare
cast aspersions...

123
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,295
...on the drink I did you the honor
of providing you with?

124
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,591
Never! I wouldn't dream of letting
such fine drink go to waste!

125
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,470
King of Conquest...

126
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:01,643
You agreed that the Grail's rightful
ownership lies with another,

127
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,062
...so will you take it by force?

128
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,275
What makes the Holy Grail
so important to you?

129
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,412
Reincarnation.

130
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:26,501
Hey, wasn't your goal supposed
to be world conquest-

131
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,963
Idiot.

132
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,467
As if I would leave the conquering
to some mere cup!

133
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,345
Conquering the world is
my dream to make true!

134
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,808
The wish I would ask of the Holy Grail
is but the first step towards that goal.

135
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,856
Mongrel, you would dare challenge me
over something so trivial?

136
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:53,570
Even if magic lends us form in this world,
ultimately, we remain Servants.

137
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,492
I wish for rebirth,
to live as a flesh and blood man,

138
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,745
...within this world
in which I find myself.

139
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,458
And with nothing but my body,
I shall defy both heaven and earth.

140
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,045
That is the meaning of conquest.

141
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:15,592
Thus it begins, then proceeds,
and is finished.

142
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,472
Such is the path of my conquest.

143
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,725
Then the matter is settled, Rider.

144
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,437
I shall kill you myself.

145
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,857
Surely I don't have to remind you
of the obvious at this point.

146
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:36,738
I have every intention of plundering
your storehouse bare, so get ready.

147
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,410
That is hardly fitting of
how a king should be.

148
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:48,417
Then let us hear what you would say.

149
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,425
I wish for my homeland's salvation.

150
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,720
With the omnipotent wish-granting device,

151
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,682
...I shall avert Britain's fate of destruction.

152
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,440
They're having a drinking party,
of all things?

153
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,235
Shall I continue to leave Archer
to his own devices?

154
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,612
It can't be helped.

155
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,490
After all, when one
is King of Kings,

156
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,578
...it simply won't do to turn
one's back on a question.

157
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,080
Incidentally, Kirei...

158
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,127
How do you judge the relative
strengths of Rider and Archer?

159
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:37,507
Rider may possess a trump card
that surpasses the Gordius Wheel.

160
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,469
I believe we should
put this to the test.

161
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:46,016
With Rider and his Master drinking with their
guards down, a better chance to attack...

162
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,226
...will never present itself.

163
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,855
The odds of victory do not matter.

164
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,316
Even if Assassin is defeated,

165
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:59,196
...as long as he can gauge their relative strengths,
our objective will be accomplished.

166
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,159
We do have the option of launching
an attack right now, Kirei.

167
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,036
I have no objections.

168
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:10,957
I believe it will take roughly 10 minutes
to summon all of the Assassins.

169
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,003
Fine. Give the order.

170
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,549
It is a large gamble, but even if we fail,
we don't have anything to lose.

171
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,178
Kirei, use a Command Seal
to give Assassin the following order:

172
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,098
"Be victorious, no matter the cost."

173
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,522
Hey, King of Knights.

174
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,025
Did you just say that you would change fate?

175
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,529
Does that mean you wish to change the past?

176
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,655
Indeed.

177
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,033
Even if it is a wish that a miracle alone cannot fulfill,

178
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,246
...if the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent, then surely...

179
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,750
Um, Saber...

180
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,961
Just so I am clear on this...

181
00:13:56,044 --> 00:14:01,216
It was during your time that
this country "Britain" fell?

182
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,844
When it was under your rule?

183
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,180
Indeed. That is why
I cannot allow it.

184
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,224
That is why I regret it.

185
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,601
I want to alter that outcome!

186
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,230
For it was I who was to blame,
and no other!

187
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,277
Archer, what is so amusing?

188
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,740
You call yourself a king, and
are praised by all as such...

189
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,201
And yet you feel "regret"?

190
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,454
How can I not laugh?

191
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,623
Saber.

192
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,334
Surely you do not mean...

193
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,214
...that you would erase the marks that
you yourself have left on history?

194
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,173
I do!

195
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,843
Why should that bother you?
Why do you laugh?

196
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,763
The country that gave me my blade,
to which I devoted my life, was destroyed.

197
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,932
Why should it be strange
for me to find that sad?

198
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,018
Did you hear that, Rider?

199
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,730
Did you hear what this little girl who
calls herself King of Knights said?

200
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,108
"To which I devoted my life..."

201
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,319
Why is that humorous?!

202
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:08,617
To ensure their country's prosperity, a king
should be willing to make any sacrifice.

203
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,452
No.

204
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,455
The king does not devote himself.

205
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,542
It is the nation and the people
who devote themselves to the king.

206
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,294
Not the reverse.

207
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,173
What?
Those are a tyrant's words!

208
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,382
Just so.

209
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,844
We are heroes because
we are tyrants.

210
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,304
However, Saber,

211
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,892
...if a king regrets his rule
or its end,

212
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,810
...that king is nothing but a fool.

213
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,104
Even worse than a tyrant.

214
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,816
Iskandar, your reign ended
with your heirs slain,

215
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,236
...and your empire dissolved
into three parts.

216
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,199
You have no regrets about that end?

217
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,450
None.

218
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,124
Not if it came to pass by my judgment
and my retainers' sacrifices...

219
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,669
Its destruction was inevitable.

220
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,588
I shall mourn it.
And shed tears over it.

221
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,882
But I shall never regret.

222
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,092
You...

223
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,219
Let alone undo it!

224
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:15,141
Such an act would be an insult
to all who fought alongside me!

225
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,144
Only warriors can find
glory in destruction!

226
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,022
Of what worth is a king who fails
to protect the powerless?

227
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,150
A just rule, with just laws...

228
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,152
Those are the true duties of a king!

229
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:32,200
So you, the king, are a slave
to what is right?

230
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,368
That is acceptable.

231
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,079
A king is a martyr to their ideals.

232
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,916
That is not how a person should live.

233
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,213
If I rule the nation as king,
I cannot expect to live as a person.

234
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,507
King of Conquerors,

235
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,427
...you seek the Grail merely
for your own benefit.

236
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,221
You could never understand...

237
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:58,226
You who became a ruler only to
satisfy your endless greed.

238
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,187
A king without greed is
even worse than a figurehead!

239
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,565
Saber.

240
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,776
You said you would martyr
yourself for your ideals.

241
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,448
In life, you must have been
a pure saint.

242
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,118
A proud and noble figure, certainly.

243
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:20,790
But who can truly admire
the martyr's thorny path?

244
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,418
Who dreams of such an ending?

245
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,838
A king...

246
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,174
The king must be greedier
than any other.

247
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:33,094
He must laugh more loudly
and rage for longer.

248
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,015
He must embody the extreme
of all things, good and evil.

249
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:42,270
That is why his retainers
envy and adore him.

250
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:46,941
And why the flames of aspiration,
to be as the king is,

251
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,194
...can burn within his people.

252
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,742
Proud king of chivalry...

253
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,287
The righteousness and ideals
you embraced...

254
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,374
...may indeed have saved
your nation and her people once.

255
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,710
However,

256
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,465
...surely you must know
what became of those...

257
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,218
...who were saved by you,
but left to fend for themselves.

258
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,512
What?

259
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:31,152
You saved them,
but you never led them.

260
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,365
You never showed them
what a king should be.

261
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,326
You abandoned your men
when they lost their way.

262
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,121
Then, alone and untroubled,

263
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,166
...you followed your own
pretty little ideals.

264
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,338
Thus, you are no true king.

265
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,133
You are only a little girl,

266
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,177
...enraptured by a false idol of
the king who serves others,

267
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,180
...but not themselves.

268
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,269
I...

269
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,189
I...

270
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,494
What are you laughing at, Archer?

271
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,121
It is nothing.

272
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,875
I simply thought that your anguished face
was a lovely sight to behold.

273
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,963
It was the face of the virgins who shower me
with flower petals in my bed.

274
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,465
You truly are a woman
after my own heart.

275
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,884
Bastard!

276
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,109
Assassin?

277
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,913
Is this your doing, Golden Boy?

278
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,208
Tokiomi humiliates himself.

279
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,837
This isn't fair! Why are there
so many Assassins?

280
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,757
We are the one, become many.

281
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,343
A Servant who is many and also one.

282
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,720
But a Servant who is one,
with many...

283
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,846
...shadows.

284
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,896
A Servant with multiple personalities
has split into separate bodies for each?

285
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,776
R-Rider, um...

286
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,112
Calm yourself, boy.

287
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,282
Even those rude enough to
interrupt our banquet...

288
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,202
...may yet show us which is
the greatest king.

289
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,915
So you'll invite them to your banquet,
also, King of Conquerors?

290
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,461
Of course. The king's words
are for all to hear.

291
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,089
If they have come to listen,

292
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,424
...it matters not if
they are friend or foe.

293
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,345
Now, don't hold back!

294
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,391
Any who would speak with us,
come forth and take a cup.

295
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,894
This drink is as your blood!

296
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,528
Very well.

297
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,448
As I said, this drink is as your blood.

298
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,827
If you insist on spilling it...

299
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,787
...then so be it.

300
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,928
Saber! Archer!

301
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,014
Here is our banquet's final question.

302
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,642
Does a king stand alone?

303
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,231
The king must indeed be alone!

304
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,860
No, you don't understand at all.

305
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,863
I suppose I'll have to show you...

306
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,200
...exactly what a real king is.

307
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,224
This is...

308
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,393
A Reality Marble?

309
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,228
That's impossible.

310
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,148
A mental image materialized
into the real world?

311
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,237
My armies once rode
across these sands.

312
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,990
The place all the heroes
who stood with me,

313
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,243
...through joy and sorrow,
will never forget.

314
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,087
I can make this world real...

315
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,382
...because it still exists
within our hearts!

316
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,637
Behold my endless armies!

317
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:13,893
Their bodies destroyed, and their souls
offered to the world as Heroic Spirits.

318
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:18,189
And still, these legendary heroes
pledge their loyalty to me!

319
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,360
My bond with them is my
greatest treasure,

320
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,986
...my path of kingship!

321
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,948
The ultimate Noble Phantasm
that I, Iskandar, possess.

322
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,201
<i>Ionian Hetairoi!</i>

323
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,793
Each of these is a Servant!

324
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,213
It has been a long time, partner.

325
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,678
A king must live a grander life
than any other's,

326
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,305
...and embody his people's
image of admiration!

327
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,557
Yes!

328
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,558
Yes!

329
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,642
Yes!

330
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,980
He who is worthy of all heroes' envy,

331
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,108
...and he who leads their way, is the king!

332
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,611
Therefore, the king is not alone.

333
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,117
For his will equals that of
all his followers combined!

334
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,493
Yes!

335
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,327
Yes!

336
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,620
Yes!

337
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,164
Now, then...

338
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,875
Shall we begin, Assassin?

339
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,504
As you can see, what we have
created here is a plain.

340
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:27,175
Unfortunately, with our superior numbers,
we hold the advantage.

341
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,886
Annihilate them!

342
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,417
That ending wasn't as
much fun as I'd hoped for.

343
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,922
We have said all there is to say.

344
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,550
I suppose that will do for today.

345
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,970
Wait, Rider. I still...

346
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,846
You, keep silent.

347
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,641
Tonight was for a conversation
amongst kings.

348
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,980
But I no longer recognize
you as a king, Saber.

349
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:14,240
Little girl, wake from your sad dream.

350
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,244
If you don't, you'll someday lose
even that modicum of pride...

351
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,246
...you retain as a Heroic Spirit.

352
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,960
The dream of a king
you spoke of is a curse.

353
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:26,836
What?

354
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,724
Pay him no heed, Saber.

355
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,809
You are correct.

356
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,020
Follow the path you believe in.

357
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,815
Your pain and sorrow
as you bear...

358
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,111
...a burden of kingship that is
too heavy a weight for any.

359
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:56,115
It is splendid to look upon.

360
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,201
Keep at it, oh King of Knights.

361
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:04,790
It is possible you may prove
worthy of still more of my love.

362
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,217
Saber...

363
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,511
I remember.

364
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,307
There was once a knight
who left Camelot,

365
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,352
...claiming that King Arthur didn't
understand how others felt.

366
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,229
Perhaps...

367
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:34,320
...that sentiment was shared by everyone
who sat at the Round Table.

368
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,749
Episode 11:
Discussing the Grail

369
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:54,965
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

370
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:03,766
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

371
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:18,781
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

372
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:27,039
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

373
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:36,132
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

374
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:42,471
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

375
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:51,147
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

376
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:58,070
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

377
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:06,162
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

378
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:14,587
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

379
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,258
This begins the second stage.

380
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,469
I'm not a normal human.

381
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,430
It is not that simple!

382
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,476
Follow what you seek.
The path is now open to you.

383
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,771
But that is an evil that
must be punished!
