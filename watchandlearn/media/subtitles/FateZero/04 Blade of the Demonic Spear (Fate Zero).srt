1
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,100
A charm spell...

2
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:22,148
Sorry. It's a curse
I was born with.

3
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,651
There's nothing I can do about it.

4
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:30,364
Blame it on my birth or the fact
that you were born a woman.

5
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,243
Surely you don't believe
that a pleasant face...

6
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,663
...will save you from
my blade, spearman.

7
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,292
I certainly hope not.
It would spoil the fun.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,501
I see.

9
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,671
Then the tales of the Saber-class
magic resistance were accurate.

10
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:46,797
Very well.

11
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,092
I prefer not to kill a girl who's
throwing herself at me, anyway.

12
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,470
It would sully my reputation.

13
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,473
I'm pleased that my first opponent
is made of stern stuff.

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,435
Oh? So you desire
a fair fight?

15
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:04,482
I consider myself fortunate to
encounter such a proud hero.

16
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,985
Then let us begin.

17
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,304
It's started.

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,599
Someone's put up a barrier.

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,644
Probably the Master of
the enemy Servant.

20
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,941
From up there, we can survey
the entire battlefield.

21
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,278
Indeed. That is certainly
the best vantage point.

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,031
Anyone seeing it would
think as much.

23
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:59,870
You circle around to the eastern wharf.
I'll take the west.

24
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:06,877
We'll find spots where we can monitor
both battle and that crane.

25
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,879
Understood.

26
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:18,889
Let us see what you're capable of,
my adorable King of Knights.

27
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:39,243
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

28
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:45,374
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

29
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:51,755
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

30
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:58,470
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

31
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:04,643
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

32
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:12,359
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

33
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,613
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

34
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,657
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
 What I wanted to give you was the future.

35
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:24,580
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,252
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

37
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:34,006
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

38
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:40,763
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

39
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:46,852
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

40
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,922
<i>Saber is watching
both spears simultaneously.</i>

41
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,176
<i>Lancer's greatest advantage is his opponent's
uncertainty as to which he will use.</i>

42
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,972
<i>The long spear in the right hand,
or the short spear in the left.</i>

43
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,683
<i>I wonder which is
the Noble Phantasm.</i>

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,980
<i>If I were sure, I could attack.</i>

45
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,817
<i>If only we knew his true name...</i>

46
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,908
<i>Whoever he is,
he's a master of the spear.</i>

47
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,369
<i>However, that is not enough.</i>

48
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,341
What's wrong, Saber?
You're on the defensive!

49
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,052
<i>This man is impressive!</i>

50
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,032
<i>Curse that blade of hers.</i>

51
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,078
<i>Without knowing its exact length,
I cannot get close enough to strike.</i>

52
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>The fact that she is able to
repel my strikes so easily...</i>

53
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,752
<i>...means that she must be
a master swordsman.</i>

54
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:05,991
Maiya.

55
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,535
Northeast of Saber and Iri.

56
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,121
On the roof of that warehouse.

57
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,082
That is Lancer's Master.

58
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,333
Can you see him?

59
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,130
Negative. Not from my position.

60
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,592
Understood. I'll take him out
from here.

61
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,857
Assassin?

62
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:46,156
There is activity at the warehouse district
at the mouth of the Mion River.

63
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,327
The first battle has finally begun.

64
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,330
Not the first.

65
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,666
To the others, this would be
the second battle,

66
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,959
...Kirei.

67
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,589
It would appear that Lancer and Saber
are the combatants.

68
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,844
Can you ascertain their status
with Assassin's eyes?

69
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,178
With ease.

70
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,057
Saber's abilities are especially high.

71
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:16,437
Most of her parameters
are rank A or higher.

72
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,480
I see.

73
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,525
It's no wonder that they are considered
the strongest class.

74
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,695
Saber likely presents a greater
threat than Lancer.

75
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,198
Can you see either Master?

76
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:34,163
There's only one person besides
the Servants who is in the open.

77
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,999
Standing next to Saber...

78
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,710
A woman with silver hair.

79
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:45,174
Then Lancer's master is wise enough
to remain hidden.

80
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,217
That's no novice.

81
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,221
They understand the rules
of the Holy Grail War.

82
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,933
Wait. A silver-haired woman?

83
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,186
Yes. Caucasian.

84
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,232
With silver hair and red eyes.

85
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,654
That doesn't sound human.

86
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,575
An Einzbern homunculus?

87
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,995
Did they create an artificial Master?

88
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,959
I had thought the only pawn Jubstacheit
had on the board was Kiritsugu Emiya.

89
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,378
It would appear that I was wrong.

90
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,800
Then that woman is the Einzbern Master?

91
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:35,390
Either way, she'll be a critical factor
in the rest of the Grail War.

92
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,893
Kirei, keep a close eye on her.

93
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,771
Ag reed.

94
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,608
I shall keep one Assassin tasked to her
at all times.

95
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,029
I can see them.

96
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,783
But Assassin should be dead,
so why is he here?

97
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,868
I knew something was up.

98
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,707
Let's see how this plays out.

99
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,460
Continue to observe Assassin.

100
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,003
I'll watch Lancer.

101
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,884
Let me attack Assassin,
and while I have him distracted,

102
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,594
...you take out Lancer's Master.

103
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,096
No, Maiya.

104
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,141
Not against Assassin.

105
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,771
We're not equipped to fight
Servants right now.

106
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,066
Understood.

107
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,998
There is no honor in a battle fought
without an exchange of names.

108
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,875
But allow me to offer my regards.

109
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,463
It is quite impressive for a woman to fight
so hard without even breaking a sweat.

110
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,383
You needn't be so humble, Lancer.

111
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,305
Even without my knowing your name, those
words from such a master of the spear...

112
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,015
...do me honor.

113
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,975
I gratefully accept them.

114
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,145
That's enough fun for now, Lancer.

115
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,815
Lancer's Master?

116
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,152
Do not allow this battle to go on.

117
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,654
That Saber is a formidable opponent.

118
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,448
Eliminate her at once.

119
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,451
You may use your Noble Phantasm.

120
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,041
Yes, my Master.

121
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,883
<i>So the long spear
is his Noble Phantasm?</i>

122
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,225
You heard him.

123
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,145
I'll go for the kill now.

124
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,399
Saber, are you using focused wind mana...

125
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,735
...to keep your blade concealed?

126
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,738
I see.

127
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,077
You have a reason
to conceal your sword.

128
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,081
My guess is that the sword
reveals your true name.

129
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,583
How unfortunate, Lancer.

130
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,253
You will never know
the name of my blade.

131
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,091
I'll finish this before
you get that chance.

132
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,510
We'll see about that.

133
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,430
I will discover
what you hide, Saber.

134
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,608
You've exposed your sword.

135
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,111
The Invisible Air is disintegrating?

136
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,135
What's going on?

137
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,446
<i>That red spear is chipping away
at the Invisible Air!</i>

138
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,741
I have the length of your blade now.

139
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,161
Now I needn't worry about being struck!

140
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,045
<i>But I still have ways to counter it.</i>

141
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,012
<i>If I wait for an attack...</i>

142
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,018
<i>One less powerful than the rest...</i>

143
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,011
Saber?

144
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,393
My thanks, Irisviel.

145
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm fine.
The healing is working.

146
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,069
So, this won't be
an easy victory.

147
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,612
<i>But why?</i>

148
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,407
<i>My armor should have easily
deflected that strike.</i>

149
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,953
<i>So how did the blade
of his spear-</i>

150
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,836
<i>The armor itself isn't damaged?</i>

151
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,754
<i>What is at work here?</i>

152
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:05,262
<i>The only answer is that Lancer's spear
bypassed the magically woven armor.</i>

153
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:11,059
So that's it. I see the secret
of your spear, Lancer.

154
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,227
Oh?

155
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,772
That red spear negates magic.

156
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,110
Your armor was created using magic.

157
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:25,407
If you were counting on it to protect you,
you should surrender, Saber.

158
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,286
You're as good as naked
before my spear.

159
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:35,292
Don't think that simply defeating
my armor gives you the upper hand.

160
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:46,344
If I cannot block your blade, I need
only kill you before it strikes.

161
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,015
Prepare to die, Lancer!

162
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,184
A bold move.

163
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,022
You're betting everything on one strike.

164
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,525
You attempted to overcome the disadvantage
of your broken armor...

165
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,820
...with the advantages you gain
by abandoning it.

166
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,616
A courageous decision.

167
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,328
I like it.

168
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,999
But in this case,

169
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,044
...it was a foolish mistake, Saber.

170
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,338
We shall see.

171
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,676
Tell me your opinion again
after my next attack.

172
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,945
<i>That was a misstep.</i>

173
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,203
<i>A Noble Phantasm needn't be
merely a single weapon.</i>

174
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,163
<i>A trap?</i>

175
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,469
This is bad... Extremely bad.

176
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,055
Wh-What is?

177
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,725
Lancer has begun his ultimate attack.

178
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,144
He intends to end the battle here.

179
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,730
Isn't that better for us?

180
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,318
Idiot! What are you talking about?

181
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:30,490
I wanted to sit back and watch
until we saw a few more Masters.

182
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,618
But at this rate, Saber may fall.

183
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,413
Then it will be too late.

184
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,791
T-Too late for what?

185
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,337
The plan was to attack once they'd
weakened each other!

186
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:51,845
I admit, I had hoped another Servant
would answer Lancer's challenge.

187
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,680
Of course...

188
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:59,686
It would be faster to fight them together
than to find them one by one.

189
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,731
Together?

190
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,482
Yes.

191
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:10,071
Rarely does one have the chance to exchange
blows with heroes from another time.

192
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,074
And with the chance to fight as many as six,

193
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,577
...I'd hate to miss out on a single one.

194
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,121
Observe Saber and Lancer!

195
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:23,501
Both are valiant warriors whom
I would dearly love to duel.

196
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,879
I cannot let either die.

197
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,798
But isn't that the point?

198
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,010
The Grail War's objective
is to kill one another!

199
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,141
To win, but not destroy.

200
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,144
To subjugate, but not humiliate.

201
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,147
That is true conquest!

202
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,998
We watch no longer!

203
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,001
We shall join the fray, boy!

204
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,711
You idiot!

205
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,089
What you're doing is insane!

206
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,593
If you don't approve,
will you stay here and observe?

207
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,180
I'll go... Take me with you, damn it!

208
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,767
Excellent... That is my Master!

209
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,029
<i>Not good. He's severed the tendon.</i>

210
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,448
<i>I can't move my thumb.</i>

211
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,370
You aren't going to make
this easy, are you?

212
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,748
Still, I really do like your
indomitable spirit!

213
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,546
Get to work, you fool.

214
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,297
You haven't finished her.

215
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,346
I apologize, my Master.

216
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,056
Irisviel.

217
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,891
I require healing, as well.

218
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,893
I have!

219
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,147
I have, but...

220
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,900
The healing worked. I'm certain.

221
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,405
Saber, you should already be fully healed!

222
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:21,369
You were sharp, realizing that my
Gae Dearg could penetrate any armor.

223
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,415
But it was foolish to abandon your armor.

224
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,296
Had you not done so, you would
have blocked my Gae Buidhe.

225
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,047
I understand now.

226
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:37,552
A cursed spear, whose wounds never heal...

227
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,471
I should have realized it sooner.

228
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,893
A red spear that destroys magic,
a cursed yellow spear,

229
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,771
...and beneath the right eye,
a mole that enchants women.

230
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:54,152
First of the Knights of Fianna,
Diarmuid of the Love Spot.

231
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,781
Never did I think I'd have
the honor of facing you.

232
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,785
Such is the pleasure
of the Holy Grail War.

233
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,539
But it is I who have the honor here.

234
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,877
No hero summoned by the Holy Grail...

235
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,796
...could ever mistake that golden blade.

236
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:20,386
To face the legendary King of Knights
and land even a single blow,

237
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,390
...I must be pretty damned good.

238
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,811
Now then, since we both know
the other's name,

239
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,815
...we can duel honorably, as knights should.

240
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,987
Or does this displease you, occurring
only after you've lost use of an arm?

241
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,619
You jest.

242
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,666
It's humiliating that you would
show me concern over such a scratch.

243
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,837
Prepare yourself, Saber.

244
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,839
Next time, you're mine.

245
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,261
Only if I fail to strike first, Lancer.

246
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,397
A chariot?

247
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,535
Both of you, sheathe your blades.

248
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,537
You are in the presence of the king!

249
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,210
I am Iskandar, King of Conquerors!

250
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:39,632
In this Grail War,
I am of the Rider class.

251
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,982
Episode 4:
Spearhead

252
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:04,157
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

253
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:12,957
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

254
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:27,972
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

255
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:36,230
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

256
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:45,323
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

257
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:51,704
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

258
00:22:52,205 --> 00:23:00,338
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

259
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:07,261
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

260
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:15,353
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

261
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:23,778
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

262
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,408
I am Iskandar, King of Conquerors!

263
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,326
I can't read his status
or anything else!

264
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,577
Irisviel, get back!

265
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,329
That is his Noble Phantasm.

266
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,997
With my Command Seal, I order you...

267
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,332
Believe in your Master!

268
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,209
At last, I have been revived!

269
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,003
Nothing will remain of your corpse!
