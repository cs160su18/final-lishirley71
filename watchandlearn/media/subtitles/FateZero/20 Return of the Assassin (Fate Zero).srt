1
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,114
It's you, Kiritsugu.

2
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:58,100
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

3
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:04,065
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

4
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:10,362
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

5
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,326
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

6
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:23,167
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,462
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

8
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:32,635
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

9
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:37,848
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

10
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,142
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

11
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:45,064
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

12
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,234
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

13
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,611
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

14
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:57,368
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

15
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,834
I'm not dreaming, am I?

16
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,546
You really... came...

17
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,840
...to see me again.

18
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,551
Yes, that's right.

19
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,345
Thank you.

20
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:25,271
The final thing I must do
is return this to you.

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,043
From now on, you will be
the one who needs Avalon.

22
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:53,382
When you begin your final battle,
I'm sure it will aid you.

23
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,391
You know...
I really am happy.

24
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,229
To love... To be loved.

25
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,400
To have a husband and daughter
for nine whole years.

26
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,406
You gave me everything...

27
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,827
All the happiness in the world...

28
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,080
...that was never meant for me.

29
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,333
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,420
I wanted to show you more
of the outside world.

31
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,423
No... It's enough.

32
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,345
If there is still any happiness
left to experience,

33
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,431
...give it all to Ilya.

34
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,184
To your daughter...

35
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,188
Our beloved Ilya.

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,112
Bring Ilya to this country one day.

37
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,452
Show her everything
I didn't have the chance to see.

38
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,455
The cherry trees.

39
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,291
The summer clouds...

40
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,835
I will.

41
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,131
Okay, I'll be back.

42
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,135
Yes. Be careful...

43
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,471
...my love.

44
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,943
Saber is heading to Rider's hideout, right?

45
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,445
Yes. She's on her way.

46
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,407
I'm going to kill Tokiomi Tohsaka.

47
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:47,246
If Rider and Saber fight, there's a
good chance Archer will also appear.

48
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,831
I'll hit him there.

49
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,501
You continue to watch Iri.

50
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,211
Understood.

51
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,505
Um... Kiritsugu.

52
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:06,515
You... finally look like you used to.

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,527
I don't feel a Servant's presence.

54
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,018
<i>There's no barrier?</i>

55
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>What's going on?</i>

56
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,236
Is that good?

57
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,072
Nope. It's awful.

58
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,741
I guess Japanese cuisine
isn't that good after all.

59
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,660
Boy, you walked right by...

60
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,955
...Okonomiyaki Shouki in New Town.

61
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:17,086
Their modanyaki was a thing of beauty.
Too bad you didn't bring any of that...

62
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,591
If you want to eat there again, recover
enough so you can materialize.

63
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,470
You recognize this spot, right?

64
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,597
This is where I summoned you.

65
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,435
This is the Fuyuki location with the
leylines that suit you best, right?

66
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,563
You should be able to recover
much more quickly here.

67
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,275
I'm staying here all day.

68
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,237
Just sleeping, not doing a thing.

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,074
So take as much mana as you want,
as long as you don't kill me.

70
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,160
Maybe you'll be a little
better than now, I guess.

71
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,750
If you'd already figured it out,
you should have said something earlier.

72
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,171
Finding out afterwards that someone's been
on to you the whole time is, well...

73
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,632
It's a bit embarrassing.

74
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,052
You idiot!
You should have just told me!

75
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:12,891
If you aren't at full strength
when I need you, I'll be the one in danger!

76
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,565
Why didn't you say anything?

77
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,986
I thought maybe I could tough it out
a little longer.

78
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,282
But the fatigue from the river battle
has hit me harder than I expected.

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,413
When it's all said and done, your Noble
Phantasm consumes a ton of power.

80
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,832
At first, I didn't notice.

81
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:42,671
Because it wasn't affecting me, I thought
it was incredibly efficient or something.

82
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:51,138
Rider, honestly, instead of using mana
that was supposed to come from me,

83
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,016
...you managed to use
your own stored power, didn't you?

84
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,853
And you did it twice...

85
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,606
What's the big idea, doing that?

86
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,358
Well, you know...

87
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,616
When you get right down to it,
as a Servant, I'm a natural soul eater.

88
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,535
If I involve you when I expend
mana at my maximum rate,

89
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,455
...it could put your life at risk.

90
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,708
I'm fine with that...

91
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,753
This is a battle I began.

92
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,048
If I don't shed blood
or make sacrifices,

93
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,301
...and then win at the end of it all,
there's no point.

94
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,891
I just...
I want to prove myself.

95
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,434
That I...

96
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:42,231
That even someone like me can take what
he wants with his own two hands!

97
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:48,737
But, kid, that only applies if
the Grail truly exists.

98
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,407
You know, I once did
something similar.

99
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,411
Fought for something that
might not have even existed.

100
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,622
Oceanus.

101
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,249
That's right.

102
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,753
I told them I'd show them Oceanus,

103
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:09,383
...and they were so swept up by my story
that they followed me without a single doubt.

104
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,552
Many died...

105
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:16,056
All dreaming of Oceanus
until the very end.

106
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,603
When I gained this era's knowledge,
that hit me really hard.

107
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,856
I'd had no idea the world
was an enclosed circle.

108
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,942
What a bad joke.

109
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,780
But even so, when I saw the map,
I had no choice but to accept it.

110
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:39,496
I've had my fill of letting people
die for fairy tales.

111
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,499
If the Grail's existence were certain,

112
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:47,296
...I'd have no objection to
you risking your life.

113
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,300
But unfortunately, it isn't.

114
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,593
Even so...

115
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,973
Even so, I...
I'm your Master!

116
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:07,649
Boy...
Learned to talk back, have you?

117
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,904
It's true, your Magic Circuits are
more powerful than usual.

118
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,866
If I rest all day,

119
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,493
...I should be ready to go another round
come nightfall!

120
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,996
And?

121
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,334
Another round? What do you
plan to do next?

122
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,085
Hmm... Good question.

123
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:32,174
Let us begin with Saber.

124
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:37,429
At this rate, how much will
you recover by tonight?

125
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:43,435
If I only use the Gordius Wheel for flight,
there shouldn't be a problem.

126
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,645
However...

127
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,775
...I fear I'll be able to employ
my Ionian Hetairoi only one more time.

128
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,693
I see...

129
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,197
We should probably save it
for the fight with Archer.

130
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,783
Then, Rider...

131
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,702
Why do you want to fight Saber?

132
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,749
I must defeat Saber.
No one else.

133
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,710
As a Heroic Spirit,
it is my responsibility.

134
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,128
What's that supposed to mean?

135
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:18,553
If I don't show that silly girl
the right path, she'll never learn.

136
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,139
That would be too sad
to bear thinking about.

137
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,060
Whatever, have it your way...

138
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,980
Listen, boy, quit keeping yourself
awake and just go to sleep.

139
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,109
Rest is the battle that
you face right now.

140
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,574
I am the shunned.

141
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,576
The scorned.

142
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,578
The despised.

143
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,082
Who are you?

144
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,627
My name is unworthy of praise.

145
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,505
My body unworthy of envy.

146
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,092
I am the shadow cast by
the Heroic Spirit's light.

147
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,303
The darkness born in the
shadow of shining legend.

148
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,937
Thus, do I hate.

149
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,189
Thus, do I resent.

150
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,444
I feed on the lamentation of those
who sink into the darkness...

151
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,447
...and curse those who
shine so brightly.

152
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,242
Her shadow is my shame.

153
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,245
Her honor remains forever unsullied,

154
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,415
...thus am I forever looked down upon.

155
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,588
You are the sacrifice!

156
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,308
Healing won't help me.

157
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,643
I'm going to die soon.

158
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,316
Damn it...

159
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,952
Really, what a sorry sight you are, Kariya...

160
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,333
Don't get the wrong idea.

161
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,419
I'm not blaming you.

162
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,840
Honestly, I never
would have imagined...

163
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,842
...that you'd last this long.

164
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:27,265
And so, I shall give you the ace
I've kept up my sleeve,

165
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,518
...secreted away for this stage of the game.

166
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,852
Now...

167
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,867
It works quickly, doesn't it?

168
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,620
The worm I just gave you...

169
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,415
...was the first to feed
on Sakura's purity.

170
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,794
How does it feel, Kariya?

171
00:13:55,877 --> 00:14:00,173
For an entire year, it's been
devouring the girl's life energy.

172
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,968
It's a magnificent
mana source.

173
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,720
Now go and fight, Kariya.

174
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,559
Make good use of the life
you've stolen from Sakura.

175
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:15,897
Use every ounce of
your flesh and bone to acquire the Grail...

176
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,317
If someone such as you
is even capable of it, that is.

177
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,073
Hey, Maiya...

178
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,244
Why do you fight for Kiritsugu?

179
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,623
Because I have nothing else.

180
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,627
I can't even remember
my family or my own name.

181
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,088
Maiya Hisau was the name...

182
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,342
...on the first fake passport
that Kiritsugu made for me.

183
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:02,027
All I remember is that it was
a terribly poor country.

184
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,571
The wars never ended...

185
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,324
...even though there was no money
to maintain the armies.

186
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,452
But day after day, they continued
to kill one another.

187
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,747
And then, someone had an idea.

188
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,249
Rather than conscript
and train soldiers,

189
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,837
...it was cheaper and faster to
abduct children and arm them.

190
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,214
Maiya, you...

191
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,136
Aim at the enemy and pull the trigger.

192
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,056
That was my sole function.

193
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,141
I threw everything else away.

194
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,186
As a human being, I'm dead inside,

195
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,606
...but the shell continues to move.

196
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,734
Still working like it did before.

197
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,903
That is my life.

198
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,489
But Kiritsugu took me in anyway.

199
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,825
So however he wants
to use me is fine by me.

200
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,162
That is the reason I'm here.

201
00:15:55,163 --> 00:16:00,168
In truth, Madam, it was your passion
that surprised me.

202
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,172
You've been secluded in the castle
where you were born,

203
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,841
...knowing so little of
the outside world.

204
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,927
So I can't imagine...

205
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,888
...why you would fight this hard
for Kiritsugu's dream.

206
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,849
To change a world you've
never really seen.

207
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,810
I...

208
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,521
You're right.

209
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:25,443
I cannot truly understand
Kiritsugu's ideals.

210
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,947
It's as you say.

211
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:35,203
I know nothing of the world that
Kiritsugu longs to change.

212
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,750
All my ideals are merely words that
I learned from Kiritsugu.

213
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,296
But don't let him know that.

214
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,884
I've always told him he was
doing the right thing.

215
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:55,223
I've told him those ideals
were worth giving my life for.

216
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,560
And I've pretended that
I understood him.

217
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,732
Then, Madam, have you
no wish of your own?

218
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,442
A wish?

219
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,236
No, I do have one.

220
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:15,160
I wish for Kiritsugu and Saber
to win the Holy Grail.

221
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,373
Do you mean the desire of the Einzberns,
attainment of the Third Magic?

222
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,833
No.

223
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,170
What I desire is an end to conflict.

224
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,841
If Kiritsugu's wish comes true,
and fighting everywhere ends,

225
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:35,597
...the fight for the Grail here in Fuyuki
should be no exception.

226
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:40,602
I want this fourth battle to
be the final Holy Grail War.

227
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,688
For your daughter?

228
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,694
If Kiritsugu and I fail,
they will use Ilya next.

229
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:56,993
That is the destiny that an
Einzbern homunculus must bear.

230
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,455
So my wish is to be the last.

231
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,373
If that wish comes true,

232
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,960
...she'll be able to live out her
life as a human being.

233
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,296
Maiya...

234
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,842
What will you do after Kiritsugu
reaches his goal?

235
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,678
I don't expect to survive.

236
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:21,101
Even if I do, there'd be no
reason for me to exist.

237
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,729
I'm sure it will be that kind of world...

238
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,773
...once Kiritsugu's changed it.

239
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,151
No, that isn't true.

240
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,611
You think so?

241
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,241
You must look for your
real name and family!

242
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,661
Those aren't things
you should forget.

243
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,788
You must learn what they are...

244
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,124
...and etch yourself indelibly
into the memories of others.

245
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,338
So live, Maiya. For me, too.

246
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,882
I'll do my best.

247
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,845
But that isn't until after
the battle ends.

248
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,930
Right now, we must be cautious.

249
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,351
We must stay on guard,
both he and I.

250
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,356
<i>The one who died was... Tokiomi Tohsaka?</i>

251
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,821
Really, you are--

252
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,382
Maiya!

253
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,675
Iri!

254
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,220
By my Command Seal,
I order my puppet...

255
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,391
Saber, return to
the storehouse! Immediately!

256
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,059
Kiritsugu...

257
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,398
This is...

258
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,484
Maiya!

259
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,283
Saber?

260
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,743
Don't speak.

261
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,496
Hurry.

262
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,917
Follow him outside...

263
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,878
Rider took Madam...

264
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,463
But if I leave, you--

265
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,424
I... will be fine.

266
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,427
And Kiritsugu will come soon...

267
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,055
So, hurry.

268
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,191
Maiya,
please hold on until Kiritsugu returns.

269
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,902
I shall bring Irisviel back.

270
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,711
I don't believe it, it really was Rider!

271
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,073
It was Rider...

272
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,786
Yes, I understand.

273
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,126
You mustn't cry.

274
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:40,008
Save those tears for your wife...

275
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,052
You can't cry here...

276
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,597
You're weak.

277
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:51,853
So you can't cry yet.
You can't break...

278
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,646
I...

279
00:21:54,522 --> 00:22:00,528
This morning, you finally
looked like your old self.

280
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,490
You can't lose your resolve over this...

281
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,663
Don't worry, Maiya.

282
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,291
Leave the rest to Saber.

283
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,544
Maiya, your task...

284
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,589
...is finished.

285
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,559
Maiya.

286
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,484
Maiya...

287
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,612
Episode 20:
Return of the Assassin

288
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:48,409
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

289
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:53,456
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

290
00:22:53,581 --> 00:23:02,507
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

291
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:09,639
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

292
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:17,522
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

293
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:22,443
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

294
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:28,366
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

295
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:33,371
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

296
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:38,459
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

297
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:43,339
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

298
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:50,930
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

299
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,474
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

300
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:58,438
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

301
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:04,986
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

302
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:10,950
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

303
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,454
Where is Irisviel?

304
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,664
Don't forget!
Tonight, at midnight.

305
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,833
Nothing can stop me!

306
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,543
Don't underestimate me,
King of Conquerors!

307
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,171
Because of him...
If it weren't for that man...

308
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,006
Oh, scary, scary.

309
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,633
Next Time: Knight on Two Wheels
Are you satisfied, Kariya?
