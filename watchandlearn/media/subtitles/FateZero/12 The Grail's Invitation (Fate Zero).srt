1
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,965
How would you rank
Rider's Noble Phantasm?

2
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:09,760
Equal to that of Gilgamesh's
Gate of Babylon.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,972
In other words, too powerful
to be given a rank.

4
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,978
Things ended exactly as we planned.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,441
If we'd gone against Rider unprepared,

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,986
...we would not have been
able to defend against it.

7
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,753
This begins the second stage.

8
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,756
We will use the information
Assassin gathered...

9
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,508
...to have Archer defeat our enemies.

10
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,764
In the process, a means to defeat Rider
is sure to reveal itself.

11
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,015
Yes.

12
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:00,019
Thank you for your fine work
as a Master.

13
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:20,289
Kurikaesu sekai nando te wo nobashitara
In this endlessly repeating world, how many times must I reach out

14
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:26,420
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasuno?
so that my hopeless tears thaw my black heart?

15
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:32,802
Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara
If these freshly-sprouted feelings are echoed in your own heart,

16
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:39,517
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou
I will forever be by your side, protecting you.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,689
Ochita kibou wo hirotte asu ni tsunaide yukeba
If I pick up the fallen hopes and fasten them to tomorrow,

18
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:53,405
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru
even my tangled, knotted wishes will come unraveled.

19
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,659
Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita
Shielding my eyes from the light, I did away with all my hesitation.

20
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,703
Ageta katta no wa mirai de
What I wanted to give you was the future.

21
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:05,626
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende
As I shouted in grief, holding the teary night close.

22
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:11,298
Fumi ireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga Sotto iyashite yuku
Far-off hopes soothe my feet that are weary from walking.

23
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:15,052
Tashika na kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri
Hold tight to this bond we can count on,

24
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:21,809
Susumou doko made mo
and let's keep going as far as we can,

25
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:27,898
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni
with this tainted miracle on my back.

26
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,075
I believe that last night's attack
involved all the Assassins.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,285
Understood.

28
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:43,247
By the way, Maiya,
where are we with the new base?

29
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,625
Tomorrow morning,
I will take Saber and madam there.

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,751
I see. Thank you.

31
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,004
Of course.
Goodbye, then.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,606
<i>No sign of movement from
the Tohsaka residence.</i>

33
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,944
<i>Since Assassin's attack on the first day,
Tokiomi hasn't left.</i>

34
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,197
<i>An unsettling silence.</i>

35
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,579
<i>The Matou Master appears
undefended, an easy target.</i>

36
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,622
<i>But...</i>

37
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:34,965
<i>Berserker's strange special ability
suggests that he should be left alive,</i>

38
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,384
<i>...to distract Archer and Tohsaka.</i>

39
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,513
<i>Lord EI-Melloi should have been
removed from battle already.</i>

40
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,641
<i>But Lancer still remains.</i>

41
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,268
<i>We must discover his
new Master's identity...</i>

42
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,687
<i>...as soon as possible.</i>

43
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,732
<i>Caster's location remains unknown.</i>

44
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,819
<i>But last night, several children
vanished from the city again.</i>

45
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,949
<i>They continue their atrocities,
with no apparent plan whatsoever.</i>

46
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,413
<i>Rider and his Master are constantly
on the move in his flying Noble Phantasm.</i>

47
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,249
<i>Tracking him is difficult.</i>

48
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,835
<i>However large-hearted he may seem,
he is an extremely dangerous foe.</i>

49
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>Further, I'm concerned about the
Ionian Hetairoi that Maiya reported.</i>

50
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,845
<i>But more importantly...</i>

51
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,475
<i>Can we assume that
Assassin has been completely destroyed?</i>

52
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,853
<i>In that case, his Master...</i>

53
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>If his plan was to work with Tohsaka,
using Assassin to spy on the others,</i>

54
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,370
<i>...then he should have never been
able to leave Fuyuki Church.</i>

55
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,372
<i>But that isn't what happened.</i>

56
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,666
<i>His ambush at the Fuyuki Hyatt...</i>

57
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,210
<i>His attack in the Einzbern forest...</i>

58
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,296
<i>Both of those actions
defy explanation.</i>

59
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,385
<i>Of course,
it all fits, assuming he was after me.</i>

60
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>But why?
WhY pursue me?</i>

61
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,265
<i>Two days ago,</i>

62
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,769
...he <i>should have had no way of knowing
that I am Saber's Master.</i>

63
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,735
<i>Kirei Kotomine, who are you?</i>

64
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,458
You seem to be in
fine spirits today, Archer.

65
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,753
I still see little value to this Grail.

66
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,922
But even if it is trash, that's fine.

67
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,759
I've found another form of entertainment.

68
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,930
In this world that you have constantly mocked
for being vile and full of imposters?

69
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,891
That remains unchanged.

70
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:53,812
However, I am now curious to see this
Holy Grail War through to it end.

71
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,775
I am fond of lives of hubris.

72
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,653
Those who harbor grand ambitions without
realizing that they are unequal to the task.

73
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,699
The mere sight of such people
gives me great enjoyment.

74
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,410
There are two kinds of arrogance.

75
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,123
One where you are unequal to the task,
and one where your dreams are too big.

76
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,710
The former is commonplace stupidity,

77
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,631
...but the latter is a rare species
that is difficult to find.

78
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,635
But they are identical in that they
are both fools, are they not?

79
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:31,892
Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious
commodity than the wisdom of the masses?

80
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,647
There are those who were born human,
but harbor wishes that man was not meant for,

81
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,566
...and have renounced
their humanity in its pursuit.

82
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:45,280
I never grow weary of watching
their grief and despair.

83
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,661
Kirei, what of you?

84
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,372
For once, you seem strangely pleased.

85
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,541
I am simply relieved.

86
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:00,671
I've finally been freed
from an unpleasant burden.

87
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,383
Once they disappear,
what becomes of the Command Seals?

88
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,971
In theory,
they return to the Grail.

89
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,809
The Holy Grail retakes the Command Seals
from a Master who has lost his Servant...

90
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,020
...and withdrawn from the war.

91
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,483
And if a Servant loses its Master,

92
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,695
...the Grail will take those unused Seals,

93
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,656
...and redistribute them to
a newly chosen Master.

94
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,535
The Command Seals stay
a part of this world until their use.

95
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,665
At the end, any remaining are
given to the overseer.

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,380
So depending on what happens now,
a new Master may yet appear?

97
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,631
Possibly, yes.

98
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:49,219
But the Holy Grail does not deem many
to be worthy of that role.

99
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:54,224
Thus, when a new Master is sought,
the Grail tends to select...

100
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:59,563
...one whom it had previously
deemed suitable.

101
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,777
What's wrong?
Continue, Kirei.

102
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,076
The reason the Holy Church protects
those who have left the battle is this:

103
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,955
In the event a place should open
among the remaining Masters,

104
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,875
...there is a high probability
that any unpaired Masters...

105
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,753
...will receive the Command Seals left behind.

106
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,757
This is why Grail War participants
try their best...

107
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,094
...to kill, not simply incapacitate,
enemy Masters.

108
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,598
From that perspective, Kirei,

109
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,184
...is there not a good chance
that the Command Seals...

110
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,894
...will be given to you again?

111
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,437
Impossible.

112
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,898
If, as Tokiomi suggests,

113
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,528
...the Holy Grail chose me as
a support to the Tohsaka team,

114
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,989
...I have fulfilled that duty.

115
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,449
Tokiomi already possesses...

116
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:57,287
...a winning strategy for the remaining
Masters and their Servants.

117
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,415
There is nothing more
for me to do.

118
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:05,587
If I may venture an opinion, Tokiomi's hypotheses
have been dubious from the start.

119
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:10,884
He never struck me as a man fit
to be backed by the Grail.

120
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:16,431
I am surprised that you have such harsh words
to offer regarding your own Master.

121
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,102
Kirei, you seem to be sorely mistaken
as to who serves whom...

122
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,396
...in my and Tokiomi's relationship.

123
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,902
I treat him civilly as my vassal, and he
supplies me with mana as an offering.

124
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,699
I answered his summons precisely because
those were the terms of our pact.

125
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,327
What do you make of the
Command Seals, then?

126
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,663
I hate them. However...

127
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,958
...if a vassal wishes
to become a better vassal,

128
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,920
...he must be willing to listen to words
of criticism from time to time.

129
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,881
More importantly, Kirei,

130
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,302
...you said earlier that Assassin
had completed his task.

131
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,387
What of the matter we discussed?

132
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,058
Your interest in learning the motive
of each Master for desiring the Grail?

133
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,936
Yes, he completed that investigation.

134
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:07,190
I should have had Assassin present
the report himself last night,

135
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,192
...that would have saved me
the trouble of...

136
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,361
No, this is better.

137
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,865
I'm not interested in what that
walking shade has to say.

138
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,199
Kirei,

139
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,912
...this report is meaningless
unless it comes from your lips.

140
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,551
How does it feel to drive a car,
Saber?

141
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,179
This is a splendid vehicle.

142
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,473
I cannot help but think what
would have happened...

143
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,224
...had these existed in my time.

144
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,979
Irisviel, are you certain it is all right
that I drive this vehicle?

145
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,983
You seemed to enjoy
the act of driving.

146
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,360
It's fine.

147
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,321
If you're happy,
then I'm happy, too.

148
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,825
I have to say, the skills
of a Servant are amazing.

149
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,330
This is your first time touching this machine,
yet here you are, driving it perfectly.

150
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,875
I find the sensation
somewhat odd, myself.

151
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,713
It's like I'm employing skills
that I was taught long ago.

152
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:16,718
Rather than understanding it intellectually,
my body instinctively knows what to do next.

153
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,266
Still, is this a wise idea?

154
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,186
This estate that is to be our
new base of operations...

155
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,730
...lies right in the heart
of the battlefield.

156
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,857
Don't worry on that score.

157
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,027
Secrecy is the great rule
of the Holy Grail War.

158
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,490
The Tohsakas and Matous have equal numbers
of fortifications within the city proper.

159
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,953
The Einzberns are unusual for building
that castle in such a distant location.

160
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,331
On the contrary, this new base
that Kiritsugu has secured for us...

161
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,626
...might actually be more advantageous
than the castle we had been using...

162
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,587
...because its location is
unknown to the others.

163
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,143
This is another strange building.

164
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,814
From now on,
this will be your base of operations.

165
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,400
Ah, if you could take those, Saber.

166
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,153
Understood, Irisviel.

167
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,619
Maiya...
What is this key?

168
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,080
It appears quite different
from the others.

169
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,666
It is the key to
the storehouse in the yard.

170
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,628
It is old, but I've personally confirmed
that it is solidly built.

171
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,047
No preparations were made,

172
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,760
...so this may be somewhat
lacking as a residence.

173
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,178
That's fine.

174
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,140
For now, so long as it keeps us
out of the rain, that's sufficient.

175
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:56,234
Now then, Saber,
let's go and explore!

176
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,527
Yes, let's.

177
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,367
I think this is supposed to be
like one of this country's haunted houses.

178
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,328
I'm sure all the hallways
have wooden floors,

179
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:11,041
...and the rooms' floors are woven grass,
with partitions made of paper!

180
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,379
I told him once I wanted to
see a Japanese mansion.

181
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,882
Maybe Kiritsugu remembered.

182
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,021
Was it not what you expected?

183
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,314
No...

184
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,608
I enjoyed it.

185
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:42,447
But this isn't really an ideal base
for a mage...

186
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:47,202
The magical barriers are well-laid,
but for a workshop it's...

187
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,581
When it's this open,
the magic will leak out.

188
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:56,086
I'd have preferred
a room walled off with stone or clay.

189
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,221
This is ideal!

190
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,893
It's a bit small,

191
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:16,314
...but I can craft my spells
just as well as back at the castle.

192
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,484
Simply inscribing a magic circle here...

193
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,737
...should be good enough
to make it my own.

194
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,490
Let's get started.

195
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,660
Will you help me, Saber?

196
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,539
We'll draw a magic circle there,
six feet in diameter.

197
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,498
Understood.

198
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,793
I'll require your help once we start
to craft the mercury.

199
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,754
I'll tell you how to distribute it,
so don't worry.

200
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:44,593
Will you bring me
the ingredients we left in the trunk?

201
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,514
Irisviel,
I must ask you something.

202
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,644
Today, it's as if you have carefully
avoided touching anything.

203
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,563
Have I imagined this?

204
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,649
Driving the car,
holding the keys...

205
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,320
I wouldn't have worried
over those matters.

206
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,658
But you aren't even handling
your own magic.

207
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,332
If you aren't feeling well,
it's important that you tell me.

208
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:20,503
It is my duty
to protect you when it's necessary.

209
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,964
So I must know these things.

210
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,136
I'm sorry. You're right.

211
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,222
This isn't something that
I could keep hidden.

212
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,810
Hold out your hand.

213
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,566
Saber...

214
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,946
I'm going to squeeze your hand now,
with all my strength.

215
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,197
All right?

216
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,366
Yes, go ahead...

217
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,331
Irisviel?

218
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,084
I'm not pretending.

219
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,712
This is all I can do now...

220
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,508
Just tugging your fingers is
the most I can do.

221
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,053
Grasping something
or picking it up is beyond me.

222
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,264
Dressing this morning
was so difficult.

223
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,062
Wh-What's wrong?

224
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,105
Are you hurt?

225
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,108
I'm just not feeling too well.

226
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,859
So I've cut off my sense of touch.

227
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,696
Just shutting down one of my senses...

228
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,115
...allows me to control
my power quite a bit.

229
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,368
That means I can do
everything else I must.

230
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,914
Being able to do things like this
is the specialty of a homunculus...

231
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,918
That can't be all there is to it!

232
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:47,340
What, exactly, is wrong with you?
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

233
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:53,221
You may have forgotten,
but I'm not a normal human.

234
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,767
When I'm ill,
a doctor cannot treat me.

235
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,523
I suppose you could say my condition
stems from an inherent flaw in my creation.

236
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,191
Don't worry about it.

237
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:10,655
Of course, it will mean that you'll
have to do some things for me.

238
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:15,785
From now on, I'll need you to drive,
like you did today.

239
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,539
And you'll have to help me
with my magical rituals.

240
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,166
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,961
But I'll be depending on you,
my knight.

242
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,005
Of course.

243
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,052
And I apologize for prying.
Please forgive me.

244
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,845
It's really okay.

245
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,682
Now, let's get started on that circle.

246
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,603
If I rest in a magical circle that is
properly connected with local leylines,

247
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,273
...my condition should
improve a little.

248
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,985
Understood.
Then I shall retrieve the materials.

249
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,078
As far as Lancer's Master
and Rider's Master go,

250
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,373
...they have no wish in particular
to ask the Holy Grail to grant.

251
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,669
They simply seek victory as a means
to win glory as Mages.

252
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,672
As for Caster's Master,

253
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,218
...he does not so much as understand
what the Grail is.

254
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,720
He is only taking part in
the Holy Grail War...

255
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,973
...as an extension of his interest
in killing for fun.

256
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,684
As for Berserker's Master,

257
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,647
...he is immature, and seeks
absolution above all else.

258
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,859
For a time, he had severed all
ties with the Matou family,

259
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:34,781
...and yet he is now demanding that the
younger Tohsaka daughter be set free,

260
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,993
...who is now being groomed to be the next
Matou family head in his place as a result.

261
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,663
He has been given the
assignment of...

262
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,749
...winning the Holy Grail to
secure his end of the bargain.

263
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:51,131
In addition, he appears to have some sort
of past relationship with Tohsaka's wife.

264
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,552
In a sense, it might be said that
he has the most unrefined...

265
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,264
...and banal motives
of the five competing Masters.

266
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,602
What is it?
Continue, Kirei.

267
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,230
Saber's Master...

268
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,741
...has merely been hired to achieve...

269
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,745
...the Einzbern's long-held dream,

270
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,248
...attaining the Holy Grail.

271
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,126
I was a fool to expect more from him.

272
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,253
Just another mongrel.

273
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,297
Mongrels, every last one of them,

274
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:38,261
...with utterly dull reasons
for seeking my treasure.

275
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,765
You caused me to go
to all that trouble,

276
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,893
...and that is all you have to say?

277
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,395
Think of those whose effort
has been wasted.

278
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,107
Wasted effort?
What wasted effort, Kirei?

279
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:55,528
The work put in by you and Assassin
has paid off handsomely.

280
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,116
Do you mock me,
King of Heroes?

281
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,951
You do not understand?

282
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,912
I suppose that is to be expected.

283
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,832
You are a man who cannot even
see his own superiority.

284
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,544
Regardless of its own
self-awareness of this fact,

285
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,005
...a soul instinctively
seeks out the superior.

286
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,927
This expression of the soul appears
in the form of interest or appreciation.

287
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,264
Thus, Kirei,
having you tell me...

288
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:28,144
...what you've seen and heard
was already of great importance.

289
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,314
What you spoke of at greatest length...

290
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,943
...was what interested you
the most.

291
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,990
First, let us discount the man you've
deliberately avoided speaking of.

292
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,535
An interest that one is aware of
is nothing more than obsession.

293
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,831
That being the case,
of the remaining four Masters,

294
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,835
...of which did you speak
most passionately?

295
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,713
Berserker's Master.

296
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,132
Kariya, was it?

297
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:03,721
Kirei,
you spoke of him in great detail.

298
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,059
His circumstances are complicated.

299
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,562
Thus, they required the most
additional explanation.

300
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,147
Wrong.

301
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:17,944
He was the only one you ordered Assassin
to investigate to such a degree...

302
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,238
...that you could understand those
complicated circumstances.

303
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,574
And this was due to your
unconscious interest.

304
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,454
I accept that I made
an error in judgment.

305
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,959
It's true that, in the long term,
Kariya Matou poses no threat.

306
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,044
He was not worth the attention.

307
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,839
My overestimation of his abilities...

308
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,217
...has invited your unwanted
attention to me.

309
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,303
Is that so?

310
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,806
Then imagine for me a scenario
in which chance and fortune...

311
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:52,103
...ensured that Berserker and his Master
survived until the end.

312
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:56,607
Can you imagine what
would happen then?

313
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,701
Hey, Kirei.

314
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,371
Isn't it time that you understood?

315
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,124
The true question I ask of you?

316
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,088
Tell me, Archer...

317
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,427
What could be the point
in imagining Kariya Matou's victory?

318
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,388
No point.
None at all.

319
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,768
Come now, don't be so angry.

320
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,603
Think about it.

321
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,106
The fact that Kirei Kotomine never
recognized the futility...

322
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,524
...in such speculation.

323
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,279
Do you not agree there is a clear,
unshakable meaning there?

324
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,909
Explain for me, Archer.

325
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:53,373
If you'd been given the same question,
but regarding the other Masters,

326
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,334
...you'd have perceived immediately
that there was no point to it.

327
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,212
And you would have rejected it
as a waste of time.

328
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,713
However...

329
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,299
That was not how it went with Kariya.

330
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,052
You abandoned your usual sharp wits,

331
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,138
...wasting your time in pointless thought.

332
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,349
You put the futility out of mind.

333
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,434
You did not count your
wasted effort as a loss.

334
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,354
In other words, you found
enjoyment in it.

335
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,564
Celebrate, Kirei.

336
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:22,819
You have understood
what entertainment is at last.

337
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,822
Entertainment?
You mean joy?

338
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,240
Indeed.

339
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:33,955
There is nothing in Kariya Matou's fate
that could bring a man joy.

340
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,751
For him, life is nothing
but suffering and tragedy.

341
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,840
For him, a quick death
would be a blessing.

342
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,594
Kirei, why must you insist on
defining joy so narrowly?

343
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,472
Where is the paradox in finding
suffering and tragedy...

344
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,683
...simply other forms of joy?

345
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,853
There is no one fixed type of joy.

346
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,856
Your confusion derives from your
failure to understand that.

347
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,316
This is something that
cannot be allowed.

348
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,530
King of Heroes,
an inhuman monster such as yourself...

349
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,117
...may find joy in some
small amount of pain.

350
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,872
But that is the soul of a sinner,
an evil that must be punished!

351
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:21,002
Thus it is, on the path of
faith that I follow.

352
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,006
And so, you have defined
joy itself as a sin.

353
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,718
It's astonishing to see
how far you've twisted it.

354
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,680
You never cease to be
a source of fascination to me.

355
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,768
This pain...

356
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,068
So, just as I expected.

357
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,238
I must admit,
that didn't take long.

358
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,240
Impossible...

359
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,785
No Servant has been freed
from their contract.

360
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:58,039
Why has a new Master been chosen?

361
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:03,920
It appears that the Holy Grail
still expects much from Kirei Kotomine.

362
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:08,382
Kirei, you should heed
the Grail's summons.

363
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:13,471
Without a doubt, you have a reason
to seek this wish granter.

364
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,516
I have a reason
to seek the Holy Grail?

365
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,894
If this wish-granting device
is truly omnipotent,

366
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:25,525
...then it can give shape to the wish
within the depths of your heart,

367
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,736
...that of which even you
remain unaware.

368
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,950
So you claim that since I do
not know my desire,

369
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,410
...I should use the
wish-granting device...

370
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,038
...as a means to learn it?

371
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:45,920
But that can only happen after
I have crushed six other wishes.

372
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:51,259
If I seek the Holy Grail
for my own desires,

373
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,138
...that will mean that I have betrayed
my own teacher and mentor.

374
00:25:56,556 --> 00:26:00,142
Then you'll need a strong Servant,

375
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,687
...if you would seek to fight me.

376
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,567
Of course before any of that,
you must steal another Servant,

377
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,279
...controlled by one of the other Masters.

378
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,532
In that case...

379
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,076
No, I won't say it.

380
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,746
Everything from here onward is up to you.

381
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,792
Do exactly as you like.

382
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,461
That is the true meaning
of pleasure.

383
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,214
Pleasure leads to joy.

384
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,884
And joy will lead you to happiness.

385
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,512
Your path is now clear, Kirei.

386
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:41,309
So clear there is no longer
any need to hesitate.

387
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,645
Episode 12:
The Grail Beckons

388
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:52,945
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

389
00:26:53,029 --> 00:27:01,746
Omoide ni yorisoi nagara kimi wo omoeru nara
All I wish is to love you as I snuggle your memory.

390
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:16,761
Itsumo minareteru madobe ni utsutta
Your eyes, which I see reflected in the window so often,

391
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:25,019
Sono hitomi wa ashita wo muite ita
were looking out towards the future.

392
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:34,111
Aa sakaraenu sadame to shittemo Kowaku nai
Even if I learn that my fate cannot be changed, I will not be afraid.

393
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:40,493
Kokoro kara shinji te iru
I believe in you from the bottom of my heart.

394
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:49,126
Shizuka ni utsuri yuku tooi kioku no naka
In my distant, shifting memories,

395
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:56,050
Kimi to sugoshita akashi wa tashika ni koko ni aru
The proof that we spent time together does exist here.

396
00:27:56,133 --> 00:28:04,141
Afure dasu kimochi wo oshiete kureta kara
Because you told me of your feelings that could not be contained,

397
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:12,566
Kono sekai ga nakunatte mo watashi wa soko ni iru
even if this world vanishes, I will be with you.

398
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,446
I shall be the first to strike!

399
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,116
Now is your best chance
to finish them.

400
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,283
Let's end this!

401
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,370
I'm certain this world is
filled with God's love.

402
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:29,750
Now, once again, we shall
raise Salvation's banner!
