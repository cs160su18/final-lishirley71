1
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:06,108
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

2
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:12,073
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

3
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:18,370
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

4
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:23,334
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

5
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:31,175
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

6
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,470
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

7
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:40,643
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

8
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:45,773
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

9
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,150
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

10
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,072
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

11
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,242
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

12
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,619
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

13
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:05,376
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

14
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,965
Murdered?!

15
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,929
Impossible...

16
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,723
Why would even the priest
have been killed?

17
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,517
It's unthinkable.

18
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,853
This cannot be allowed!

19
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,946
I'm sure it must also be regrettable for you
to lose the Father in this way.

20
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,030
Yes.

21
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:40,327
Father Risei was like
a second father to me.

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,248
It has been one unexpected
disaster after another...

23
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,794
It might prove necessary to formulate
a plan of some sort at once.

24
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,849
Why did you not tell Tokiomi?

25
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,894
Tell him what?

26
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,563
I pity your father...

27
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,317
He died, believing his son
to be a man of God.

28
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,068
Or rather...

29
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,405
Perhaps that might have
been his salvation?

30
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,951
Does your father's death arouse
no feeling within you at all?

31
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,996
He was killed, after all.

32
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,917
You could at least try
to look a little sad.

33
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,294
It does. I am frustrated
to no end.

34
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,172
Frustrated, eh?

35
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,761
Are you frustrated because you were
unable to kill him yourself?

36
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,563
Saber...

37
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,442
Irisviel, how are you feeling?

38
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,448
It appears I've made you worry.
I'm sorry...

39
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:04,870
No, as long as you truly are all right,
that is all that matters.

40
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,455
But...

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,838
It's okay. It is Maiya's presence
that you are sensing.

42
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,091
From Tohsaka?

43
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:21,011
Yes. Tokiomi Tohsaka requests
that we present a united front.

44
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,056
An alliance? Now?

45
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,892
Surely Tohsaka is uneasy...

46
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,645
...at the thought of dealing
with Rider and Berserker.

47
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:35,067
So he has invited us to meet,
assuming that we would be most amenable.

48
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,821
Meaning that, compared to the two other teams,
he believes us the weakest.

49
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:43,951
Tohsaka said he wishes to meet tonight
at the Fuyuki church.

50
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,371
From the start,
Tokiomi Tohsaka...

51
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:51,667
...has made elaborate
preparations for this Grail War.

52
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:59,091
And it's also likely that he secretly controlled
Assassin's Master, Kirei Kotomine.

53
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,015
If Tohsaka exerts some influence
over Kirei Kotomine,

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,768
...then I believe we cannot
ignore this offer.

55
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,145
You're right.

56
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,024
Kirei Kotomine...

57
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,027
Keep this in mind, Saber.

58
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:24,116
If there is anyone in this Grail War who can
defeat Kiritsugu and claim the Holy Grail,

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,119
...it is Kirei Kotomine.

60
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,293
We shall accept.

61
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,138
Father?

62
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:51,894
Father!

63
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,912
Rin, your father says that he
would like to speak with you.

64
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:29,932
Rin.

65
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,977
Until you reach adulthood, keep
the Mages Association in your debt.

66
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,231
Beyond that, I leave the rest
up to your judgment.

67
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:41,151
You'll be fine on your own.

68
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,987
One day, the Holy Grail will appear.

69
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,282
It is the Tohsaka family's
duty to claim it.

70
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:52,788
Above all else, if you wish to be a mage,
that is the path you cannot avoid.

71
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,208
Rin. Take this.

72
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,007
Well, then I'll be going.

73
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,635
You know what to do now, right?

74
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,303
Yes.

75
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,725
I'll see you soon, Father.

76
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:37,666
First, allow me to thank you
for coming at my behest.

77
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,794
Let me introduce you.

78
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,256
This is Kirei Kotomine, my student.

79
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,510
While we were once
competitors for the Grail,

80
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,221
...all that is now in the past.

81
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:56,810
He has lost his Servant, and has
yielded his rights as a Master.

82
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,523
This Grail War is heading
toward its conclusion.

83
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:06,570
The ones remaining are, as anticipated,
the Masters of the three great houses,

84
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,822
...along with one outsider.

85
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,659
Now, what is your appraisal
of the state of the war?

86
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,620
I have no opinion.

87
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,206
We control the most
powerful Servant, Saber,

88
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,666
...so we have no need to await
an opportune time to strike.

89
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,294
We shall simply continue
to win each battle.

90
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,670
I see.

91
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:28,634
Unfortunately for the Matous, it is my opinion
that they erred in their strategy.

92
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,304
They seemed to have imposed a draining
Servant upon a frail Master,

93
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,557
...thereby hastening
his self-destruction.

94
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,061
Rider is likely to be the victor
in a match between the two.

95
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,315
The Grail must not be allowed
to fall into outside hands.

96
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,194
We two should be able to
agree on that much.

97
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,446
Any alliance is out of the question.

98
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,951
However, if you wish to discuss the order in
which we approach our enemies,

99
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,079
...we may be able to come
to some agreement.

100
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,331
Elaborate.

101
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:05,087
We can settle things with the Tohsaka team
after we have defeated the other Masters.

102
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,215
We are prepared to agree
to such a proposal.

103
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,301
So a temporary,
conditional ceasefire?

104
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,720
A fair compromise.

105
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,348
We have two conditions.

106
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:24,439
First, that you share any information you have
concerning Rider and his Master.

107
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,191
Ag reed.

108
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,364
Our second condition is that Kirei Kotomine
be removed from the Holy Grail War.

109
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,035
Kill Kirei?

110
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,080
I am not suggesting that he be killed.

111
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,000
But I insist that,
until this battle is over,

112
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,379
...he be expelled from Fuyuki,
or better yet, from Japan entirely.

113
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,673
Immediately.
Before tomorrow morning.

114
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,885
Would you explain why?

115
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:59,391
There is bad blood between
the Einzberns and the Executor.

116
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,437
If the Tohsaka team continues
to protect him,

117
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,691
...we will find ourselves unable to trust
you under any circumstances.

118
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,485
To what is she referring?

119
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,196
Kirei.

120
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,370
Well?
How do you like Kiritsugu's present?

121
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,915
It's much more like a horse
than a car is.

122
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,168
This seems to suit me better.

123
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,881
I shall go ahead, then.
I shall scout out the route ahead.

124
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,347
Let us go, as well.

125
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,186
M-Madam?

126
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:45,729
What's wrong?

127
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,065
Drive, Maiya.

128
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,566
But you--

129
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,736
Tohsaka will realize there
is something amiss...

130
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,372
This isn't unexpected...

131
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,707
It was inevitable.

132
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,212
Honestly, the fact that I've been
able to function...

133
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,466
...for this long as a human
is a miracle.

134
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,719
Does Kiritsugu know of this?

135
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,971
Don't tell Saber.

136
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,308
She has a crucial battle
ahead of her.

137
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,395
I don't want to distract her
with any undue concern.

138
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,399
But Maiya... There is something
I want to speak to you about.

139
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,320
I am a homunculus created
for the Holy Grail War.

140
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,365
You know that, right?

141
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,408
Yes.

142
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:44,788
Grandfather Acht gave the vessel
an instinct for self-preservation...

143
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:49,501
...so that it would avoid all danger
and safeguard the Grail to its completion.

144
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:54,423
He disguised the vessel,
and called it Irisviel.

145
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,300
That is who I am.

146
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,846
But how... Then you are—

147
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,350
Very soon,
I will revert back to what I was.

148
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:11,606
Next time, I won't even be able to
talk to you like this.

149
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,862
That's why Kiritsugu
gave me Saber's scabbard.

150
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,780
Avalon...

151
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,074
Are you familiar with
its effects?

152
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,828
It halts aging and provides
an infinite healing ability.

153
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,204
Or so I'm told.

154
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:31,877
Its effects are what has prevented the
hollow shell that is me from collapsing.

155
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:38,592
Of course, it stops working as soon as
Saber is no longer nearby.

156
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,720
Why tell me this?

157
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,181
Maiya Hisau...

158
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,934
You would never pity me.

159
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,188
You'd accept me.

160
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,190
That's why.

161
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,192
Madam, I...

162
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,987
I have always thought of you
as distant.

163
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,198
That's not true...

164
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,200
Do you understand?

165
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,201
Yes.

166
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,661
Even if it costs me my life,

167
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,208
...Irisviel, I will see
you through to the end.

168
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,001
So please,

169
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,130
...die for Kiritsugu Emiya.

170
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,008
To make his dream a reality.

171
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,139
Thank you.

172
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:33,271
I wish you had told me of your
history with the Einzberns.

173
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,900
Unfortunately, I am left with no choice.

174
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,404
You must withdraw
from this war,

175
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,906
...Kirei.

176
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya... Who are you really?</i>

177
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:08,265
<i>Will I leave this place,
never even learning that?</i>

178
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,811
Still thinking, even now?

179
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,231
Could you truly be
so slow, Kirei?

180
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,277
The Grail beckons to you still.

181
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,283
And you yourself
still long to fight.

182
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,578
For as long as I can remember,

183
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,831
...I have spent my life in
search of a single thing.

184
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,960
I've devoted every moment to it.
Endured great pain for it.

185
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,005
But all of that has
come to naught.

186
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,800
And yet, I sense that the
answer to my question...

187
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,178
...is closer now than it ever has been.

188
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,725
After all that self-reflection,
why in the world do you hesitate?

189
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,727
I have a deep foreboding.

190
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:59,608
That when I've learned all the answers,
it will result in my destruction.

191
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,741
Understood. Well done.

192
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,371
You've received an exciting
bit of news, I take it?

193
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:18,126
We've learned the location of the stronghold
where the Einzberns have been hiding.

194
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,714
As I live and breathe, Kirei!
You honestly amaze me...

195
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,010
You were planning to
continue all along!

196
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,306
I did hesitate.
I was even prepared to give up.

197
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,353
But in the end,
it is as you say, King of Heroes.

198
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:42,067
I know no other way than to
keep asking the question.

199
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,361
What is that?

200
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,364
A gift from my father.

201
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,994
Jn424.

202
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,789
The Gospel of John.

203
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,000
God is spirit.

204
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:04,589
And those who worship Him must
worship in spirit and in truth.

205
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,429
However, Kirei...

206
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,391
There remains a rather grave problem.

207
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:19,187
Should you participate in the
Grail War of your own will,

208
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,649
...Tokiomi Tohsaka
becomes your enemy.

209
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,695
In other words, you have entered the
same room as an enemy Servant...

210
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,281
...with no plan to defend yourself.

211
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,284
A dire situation,
would you not agree?

212
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,831
Not at all. I came prepared
with something to trade for my life.

213
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,583
Gilgamesh...

214
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,380
Let me tell you the truth behind the
Holy Grail War that has been kept from you.

215
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,923
Which is?

216
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,218
The ritual held here in Fuyuki...

217
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,431
...is an attempt to open a
passage to the Root,

218
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,184
...by means of the sacrifice of the
souls of seven Heroic Spirits.

219
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:04,399
The Great Grail is activated by
killing all seven Servants.

220
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,609
Yes, all seven.

221
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,737
You understand?

222
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,950
That's the reason my master has worked so hard
to avoid using his Command Seals.

223
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,411
Because when all
the battles are over,

224
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:21,124
...he will require them to force his own
Servant to commit suicide.

225
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:26,921
Then you claim the loyalty Tokiomi
has shown me has all been a lie?

226
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:33,261
Put another way, my master
is a mage to his very core.

227
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,139
He may worship a Heroic Spirit,

228
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,850
...but he harbors no illusions
about his idols.

229
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,519
Tokiomi...

230
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,856
At last you have shown
some hint of promise.

231
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:50,111
That boring little man
will finally be able to entertain me.

232
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,031
Now then, what will you do,
King of Heroes?

233
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,951
Knowing what you know now,
will you remain loyal to my master...

234
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,496
...and punish me for rebelling
against him?

235
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,290
A fair question, indeed.

236
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:07,921
Regardless of his treachery,
Tokiomi still supplies me with mana.

237
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,926
Were I to abandon my Master, it would hamper
my ability to remain materialized.

238
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,306
Oh... Come to think of it, there is a Master
with a Command Seal but no partner.

239
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:23,019
One searching for a Servant
unbound by contract.

240
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,022
Now that you mention it,
you're right.

241
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,983
But there is a question...

242
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:33,029
...of whether that man is a worthy Master
in the eyes of the King of Heroes.

243
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,031
He will suffice.

244
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:40,703
He is a bit stiff, perhaps,
but he has great potential for growth.

245
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,542
He may yet prove a fine source
of entertainment for me.

246
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,215
I've been waiting, Kirei.

247
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,177
I came to have a word with you
before you depart Fuyuki.

248
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,018
I'm still proud to have had
you as my student.

249
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,523
I hope you will maintain
good relations...

250
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:12,110
...with the Tohsaka family,
as your late father did.

251
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,570
What do you say?

252
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,447
Your words honor me.

253
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,284
Once this Grail War has ended,

254
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:24,038
...I'd like for you to help
train Rin, Kirei.

255
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,628
It's simple, but in essence,
it's a will.

256
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:35,383
I thought it prudent to be
prepared for the worst.

257
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,804
It leaves the Tohsaka
family wealth to Rin,

258
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:44,601
...and names you as her guardian
until she comes of age.

259
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,353
Leave it to me.

260
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:52,650
I shall do all I can
to look after your daughter.

261
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,237
Thank you, Kirei.

262
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,614
What is this?

263
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,908
It's for you.

264
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,951
A gift from me.

265
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,578
Open it.

266
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,625
An Azoth dagger.

267
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,086
It symbolizes your mastery of
the Tohsaka family magics,

268
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,048
...and marks the end of
your apprenticeship.

269
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,552
You are far too kind to me, sir.

270
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,846
I cannot begin to
express my gratitude,

271
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,389
...my master.

272
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,893
It is I who must thank you.
Kirei Kotomine.

273
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,689
Now I can prepare
for the final battle.

274
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,610
Look at the time.

275
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,155
I'm sorry to have kept you.

276
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,619
I hope I haven't made you
miss your flight.

277
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,710
No.

278
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,882
You needn't worry,
my master.

279
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:10,186
I never bought a ticket.

280
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,244
Master...

281
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:35,420
How like my father you are. Even at the
very end, you never understood me.

282
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,428
Such a boring end.

283
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,265
Look at that. Such an idiotic
expression on his face.

284
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:52,145
He did have a dematerialized
Servant at hand.

285
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,439
It was only natural for him
to lower his guard.

286
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,650
So, you have learned
to jest already.

287
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,737
I shall praise you for your
aptitude at studies.

288
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,114
Well, Kirei?

289
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,951
Do you feel a little better about not having had
the chance to kill your father?

290
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,707
You really have no qualms,
King of Heroes, Gilgamesh?

291
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,961
Not so long as you
continue to amuse me.

292
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,172
Otherwise, Kirei...

293
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,801
Well, you are the one who ought
to question his own resolve.

294
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,767
My will creates your body,
and your sword creates my destiny.

295
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:35,730
If you heed the Grail's call
and obey my will and reason...

296
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,231
I hereby swear.

297
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,944
Your offering will be my flesh,
Kirei Kotomine.

298
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,280
My new Master.

299
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,161
Now, Kirei.
Let us begin.

300
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:55,541
Put an end to this farce
in whatever manner you see fit.

301
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,835
And as a reward,
I shall give you the Grail.

302
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:03,508
Very well, King of Heroes.
May you have your fill of amusement.

303
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,011
Until such time that I find
the answer I seek,

304
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,764
...I shall gladly play the fool.

305
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,893
Episode 17:
The Eighth Contract

306
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:19,690
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

307
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:24,737
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

308
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:33,788
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

309
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:40,920
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

310
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:48,803
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

311
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:53,724
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

312
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,647
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

313
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,652
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

314
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:09,740
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

315
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:14,620
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

316
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:22,211
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

317
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,755
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

318
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:29,719
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

319
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:36,267
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

320
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:42,231
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

321
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,361
Kerry, what kind of person do you want to be
when you grow up?

322
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,572
Stop going to that mansion.

323
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,907
What is this?

324
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,700
Decide the rest for yourself.

325
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,535
It's still too early for you.

326
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,915
It's a power that can change the world,
and one day, it will be yours.
