1
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,478
Finally...

2
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,564
Hey, Waver.

3
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,151
Where are you looking?
Over here, over here.

4
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,154
G-Grandpa!
What are you doing?

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,907
Enough with the questions,
just come up here.

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,659
Let's talk for a while.

7
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,327
Talk?

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,580
Why do we have to
talk on the roof?

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,499
Grandpa, can't it wait?

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,002
Oh, don't be like that.

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,006
They really like you, kid.

12
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,135
Listen, they're just
under my spell--

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,262
Just go up there.

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,016
The old man seems to have
something important to tell you.

15
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,270
Relax, I'll patrol the area
and keep watch.

16
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,189
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,441
Worrying isn't the problem...

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:35,054
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

19
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:41,018
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

20
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:47,316
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

21
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:52,279
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

22
00:01:52,404 --> 00:02:00,121
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

23
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,415
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

24
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:09,630
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

25
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:14,802
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

26
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,138
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

27
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:22,017
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

28
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,187
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

29
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,565
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

30
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:34,321
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

31
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,498
This is the best place...

32
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:48,794
...to catch the first rays
of the morning sun.

33
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,007
Take a seat.

34
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,512
Here, I even have some coffee.
It'll warm you up.

35
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,640
Grandpa, how long have you
been up here?

36
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:06,020
When I woke up this morning and checked
in on you, you weren't back yet.

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,815
So I thought I'd take the opportunity
to watch the sun come up...

38
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,484
...while I waited for my
grandson to come home.

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,406
When you were little,

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,160
...we used to come up here
and stargaze all the time.

41
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,746
Do you remember?

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,665
Yeah, I guess.

43
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,585
When Martha and I decided
to live in Japan,

44
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,588
...we made sure to build our house
here in the hills of Miyama,

45
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:37,176
...with a skylight that we could
access the roof through.

46
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,055
We dreamed of sitting
up here on the roof,

47
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:46,310
...alongside our grandkids,
to watch the stars.

48
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,897
We never thought our wish
would come true, though.

49
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,405
Our real grandchildren
never once came up here.

50
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:03,619
Whenever I watched the stars,
I was always alone.

51
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,122
Hey, Waver...

52
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,918
You aren't our grandson, are you?

53
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:22,471
It's so strange, the way Martha and I were
so completely convinced you were.

54
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,727
To be honest, you were a little
too nice to be our grandson...

55
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,566
You aren't mad?

56
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:39,321
Well, I guess I might have
every right to be.

57
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:44,785
But lately, Martha's been so happy
and smiling all the time.

58
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,413
I couldn't have imagined
her like that before.

59
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,499
Really, I'm grateful to you two.

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,960
Besides, it doesn't seem to me...

61
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:59,341
...that you moved in with us
because you meant us any harm.

62
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,845
Actually, what do you
think about it?

63
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:09,518
If you can, I'd like for you
to stay a while longer.

64
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,897
I'm sorry...

65
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,191
But I can't promise that.

66
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,194
I can't even guarantee I'll
make it back here safely.

67
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:23,032
So you two are risking your lives?

68
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,074
Yes.

69
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:30,289
Well, I don't know how important
what you're doing is to you...

70
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:34,043
But when you've had a long life
and look back on it all,

71
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,546
...you realize that
there is nothing...

72
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:42,718
...that's really worth
risking that life for.

73
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,361
Ryudo Temple

74
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,324
<i>I guess it's been about forty hours
since I last slept...</i>

75
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,119
<i>To win the battle and
summon the Grail,</i>

76
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:14,625
<i>...one must perform the ritual
at one of the four Fuyuki leylines.</i>

77
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,879
<i>At two of them, the church
and the Tohsaka estate,</i>

78
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,673
<i>...Kirei Kotomine was
nowhere to be found.</i>

79
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,717
<i>Which leaves the other two.</i>

80
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,638
<i>Here at Mt. Enzou,
and the Fuyuki Citizen's Building.</i>

81
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,225
<i>Given the leylines' relative power,
this one is more likely.</i>

82
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,435
<i>Even if he's chosen
the Citizen's Building,</i>

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,563
<i>...I can launch a frontal assault there.</i>

84
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:42,486
<i>If Maiya were still alive,
I would have sent her to secure it.</i>

85
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,284
<i>Once again, I'm alone...</i>

86
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:00,170
<i>Come to think of it, I never figured her
into my plans from the very beginning.</i>

87
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:10,139
Since last night, I've been searching
the entire city for Irisviel.

88
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,307
But I have found no sign of her.

89
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,269
I am deeply sorry.

90
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,066
Well, then...

91
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,529
If you have need of me, use the Command
Seal and summon me as before.

92
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,669
Woman.

93
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,965
Can you hear me, woman?

94
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,097
Kirei... Kotomine.

95
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:57,186
This is where Caster's
Master once hid.

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,107
Though it appears that Kiritsugu Emiya
was never able to locate it.

97
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,527
Soon, the Holy Grail War will end.

98
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:11,116
It's quite likely that I shall be the one
to grant the Einzbern clan's wish.

99
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,786
Are you so unhappy
that it would be me?

100
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,707
There is but one man to whom
I would entrust the Grail.

101
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,794
And it is not you,
Executor.

102
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,758
Kiritsugu Emiya has already
seen right through you.

103
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,428
He recognizes you as his
greatest enemy.

104
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,888
Prepare yourself.

105
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,682
Your words are as the Gospel
to my ears.

106
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:41,605
Kiritsugu Emiya is
exactly as I imagined him, after all.

107
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,815
How laughable.

108
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,444
You couldn't be any further
from him if you tried!

109
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,655
What?

110
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,910
Even though Kiritsugu can see through you,
the reverse is impossible...

111
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,916
You have none of the things
that he carries in his heart.

112
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,086
Why do you speak of me?

113
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,089
I admit it.

114
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,967
I am an empty man.

115
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,886
However...
How do he and I differ?

116
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,640
Devoting himself to war,
without gain, for all these years...

117
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,269
Senseless slaughter...

118
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,771
Utter recklessness.
Wasted effort!

119
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,065
If he does not doubt as I do,
then what is he?!

120
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,780
Answer me...

121
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,617
What does Kiritsugu Emiya
desire from the Holy Grail?

122
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,913
What prayer would he entrust
to the wish-granting device?

123
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,879
Very well... I'll tell you.

124
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,966
Kiritsugu Emiya's wish...

125
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,636
...is for humanity's salvation.

126
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,473
An end to war and bloodshed.

127
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,642
Forever.

128
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,437
Peace on Earth.

129
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,736
What was that?

130
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,864
You can never understand.

131
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,658
That is the difference
between you.

132
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,910
He has something to believe in.

133
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,833
Conflict is humanity's
intrinsic nature.

134
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,587
To eliminate it would mean...

135
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,922
...humanity's own elimination.

136
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,426
It's futile as an ideal.

137
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,095
It's nonsense that a child
would spout!

138
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:42,559
And that is why
his only hope is for a miracle.

139
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,688
Many times, he has been forced...

140
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,193
...to sacrifice those he
loves for his beliefs.

141
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,071
Yes...

142
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,699
He is too kind to chase ideals.

143
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,203
He must love,

144
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,539
...even knowing it will mean
losing that love...

145
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,209
I understand...

146
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,908
I understand very well.

147
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,536
So that is Kiritsugu Emiya.

148
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,835
<i>At last, I see it...</i>

149
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,920
<i>My reason for fighting.</i>

150
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,341
<i>Kiritsugu Emiya...</i>

151
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:01,346
<i>I shall destroy
your ideals right before you.</i>

152
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,932
<i>And the Holy Grail, as well.</i>

153
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,751
Oh, you're up, boy?

154
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,795
I told you to wake me up
at nightfall.

155
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,464
What are you doing?

156
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,674
Sorry, sorry.

157
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,469
But I thought it might be good to
take our time with preparations.

158
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,305
Tonight, there is no
reason to rush.

159
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,639
Why?

160
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,934
I can't say why, exactly...

161
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,647
But it feels like things
will conclude tonight.

162
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,943
The night air seems too still.

163
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,573
Does that mean that fewer
participants remain?

164
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,665
From now on,
only the truly strong remain.

165
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,380
Wh-What was that?

166
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,342
A strange mana surge...

167
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,552
I've felt something similar before.

168
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,601
That pattern...

169
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,187
What is it?
Some kind of code?

170
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,523
Four and seven, in different colors.

171
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,691
"Success" and "victory."

172
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:42,989
If they're sending up that signal,
does that mean the Grail War is over?

173
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,574
No...

174
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,744
It's in a different direction
than the church.

175
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,789
Then the church didn't
send the message?

176
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:56,419
In essence, someone is getting ahead
of themselves and claiming victory.

177
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,382
That says, "If you object,
come and get me."

178
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,425
It is a challenge.

179
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,263
It looks like the big showdown
will happen tonight!

180
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:12,018
I see.
This is it, then...

181
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,562
Quite right!

182
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,983
And now that our
battlefield is known,

183
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,069
...I must ride forth in such a way...

184
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,406
...as to bring honor to
the Rider class!

185
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,825
Come forth...

186
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,451
...my steed!

187
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,338
Now, kid, it may not be as smooth
a ride as my chariot...

188
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,633
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

189
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,347
From this point, only the
truly strong can continue, right?

190
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,104
My Servant...

191
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,357
By his Command Seal,
Waver Velvet orders you!

192
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,361
Rider, fight until you gain victory.

193
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,617
And by my Command Seal,
I further order you!

194
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,620
Rider, win the Holy Grail.

195
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,791
And by my Command Seal,
I further order you!

196
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,046
Rider, take the world for your own.
I will not tolerate failure.

197
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,471
Now, I'm no longer
your Master.

198
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,017
Go... Go wherever.

199
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,270
I don't even want to see you...

200
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,360
Sure, I'll be on my way.

201
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,529
After all those annoying orders,

202
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,240
...surely you are prepared to
see this through to the end.

203
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,701
You total idiot!
Listen...

204
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,537
I have no Command Seals!
I quit being your Master!

205
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,373
Why would you still take me?

206
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,875
I...

207
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,505
Master or not,
you are still my friend.

208
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,346
I-I'm...

209
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,890
You're really okay with me?

210
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,893
I can stay by your side?

211
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:21,648
After all the battles you and I have
seen together, what are you saying?

212
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,816
Idiot.

213
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,446
Up until now, have you not
faced the same enemies as I?

214
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,156
That means you are my friend!

215
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,409
So hold your head high
and consider yourself...

216
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,869
...my equal.

217
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,168
All right, then...

218
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,422
I shall begin by obeying
your first order.

219
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,174
Boy, open your eyes,
and watch to the end!

220
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,138
Yeah, do it!

221
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,724
Right before my eyes!

222
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,328
<i>He chose the place least
suited to the ritual...</i>

223
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,582
<i>...in order to gain the
initiative in battle.</i>

224
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,420
<i>In other words,
his plan is not to steal the Grail.</i>

225
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,840
<i>But rather to use it as bait,</i>

226
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,261
<i>...to kill me and the other Masters.</i>

227
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,933
<i>That simplifies things.</i>

228
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,603
<i>If he's this incompetent an opponent,</i>

229
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,981
<i>...I'll just eliminate him quickly.</i>

230
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,235
<i>Kirei Kotomine...</i>

231
00:17:54,991 --> 00:18:00,789
You look particularly
ferocious tonight, Kirei.

232
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,167
Now, what will you do?

233
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,544
Do you wish for me
to wait here?

234
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,964
If you unleash your power at close range,

235
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,675
...you may endanger the ceremony itself.

236
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,971
If you want to fight at full strength,
go out and meet them.

237
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,431
Very well.

238
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,226
But what if this place falls
under attack while I'm away?

239
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,480
Would you allow me to use the
Command Seal to save myself?

240
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,981
I shall allow it.

241
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,151
But I do not guarantee
the Grail's safety.

242
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,654
Tonight, I shan't hold back.

243
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,700
That would be the worst outcome,
but if that should happen, it would be fate.

244
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,327
Kirei...

245
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,039
You seem to have found
your reason to fight.

246
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,668
But have you still no prayer
to offer the Grail?

247
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,672
I can think of nothing I want.

248
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:56,719
Only that I hope that nothing will
interfere with this fight.

249
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,596
Honestly...

250
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:04,727
As I suspected, the only recourse is to let
the Grail reveal what hides within your heart.

251
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,319
Oh. If it seems as if Saber will arrive
before I can return,

252
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,197
...have Berserker entertain
her for a while.

253
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,491
Understood.

254
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,577
Speaking of Saber,

255
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,038
...what happened to the doll that
was so important to her?

256
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:29,085
The Holy Grail's vessel is
within her, is it not?

257
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,629
I killed her.

258
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,258
I had no reason to let her live.

259
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,911
Are you crying,

260
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,330
...Mother?

261
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:09,334
Hey, Mother...
I had a scary dream.

262
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,961
I dreamed I turned into a cup...

263
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,088
And inside me,

264
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,675
...these seven big lumps appeared...

265
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,135
It's okay...

266
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,470
It's okay!

267
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,431
I won't let that happen.

268
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,517
That will never happen
to you, Ilya.

269
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:32,523
I know that you will be released
from the shackles of fate.

270
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,000
What is this place...

271
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,837
Inside the Holy Grail?

272
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,839
That's not--

273
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,849
<i>Then...</i>

274
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,851
<i>If I'm here...</i>

275
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,480
<i>Who am I?</i>

276
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,163
<i>That's right...</i>

277
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,874
<i>This is inside the Holy Grail.</i>

278
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,379
<i>The omnipotent wish-granting device that
will dispel all the world's sadness,</i>

279
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,799
<i>...and remove all suffering.</i>

280
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>I will have the power to
make that happen.</i>

281
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,887
<i>The end...</i>

282
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,182
<i>...is nearly at hand.</i>

283
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,024
Episode 22:
All the Evil in the World

284
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:01,821
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

285
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,868
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

286
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:15,918
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

287
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:23,051
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

288
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:30,933
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

289
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:35,855
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

290
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:41,778
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

291
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,783
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

292
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:51,871
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

293
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:56,751
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

294
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:04,342
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

295
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,886
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

296
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:11,849
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

297
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:18,398
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

298
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:24,362
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

299
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,283
Our enemy is the mighty
King of Heroes,

300
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,285
...a worthy opponent!

301
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,288
Let us demonstrate our
path of conquest!

302
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,917
King of Conquerors, I shall show you
the end of your eternal dream.

303
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,045
I, myself, shall show
you the harsh reality.
