1
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:54,096
Ato ichido dake kiseki wa okoru darou
A miracle is sure to happen just one more time.

2
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,061
Yasashii koe de egaku yuganda mirai
The twisted future described with your gentle voice.

3
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:06,358
Mou daremo nakanai sekai no tame ni
For the sake of a world in which no one will ever cry again,

4
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:11,322
Akaku kegasareta sora no
My screams and prayers

5
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:19,163
Doko nimo todokazu kieru sakebi to inori
don't reach anywhere in the red-stained sky.

6
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,458
Nagusame wa sutete ikeru
I can give up consolation and leave this place.

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,631
Kirei na tsuki no hikari ga
The pure light of the moon

8
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:33,844
Hajimari he to shizumi yuku
sinks down towards the beginning,

9
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,180
Sono Kanata he
down ever further.

10
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,060
Tozasare teku hitomi de
With my closing eyes,

11
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,230
Mada tooku he
I reach out once again

12
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,607
Te wo nobasu
far into the distance,

13
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:53,364
Kimi no nageki wo shinji te
believing in your grief.

14
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,761
<i>Did you hate me...</i>

15
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:20,474
<i>Did you hate me so much?</i>

16
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,988
<i>Origin rounds.</i>

17
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,448
<i>They cause the target's mana
to go out of control,</i>

18
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,994
<i>...causing their body
to rip itself apart.</i>

19
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,746
<i>What?</i>

20
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:47,376
<i>Time Alter: Double Accel!</i>

21
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,767
<i>The origin rounds aren't working.</i>

22
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,603
No...

23
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,605
<i>I understand.</i>

24
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,524
<i>He's using Command Seals
as his mana source.</i>

25
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,569
<i>By the time the round
takes effect,</i>

26
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,072
<i>...the Command Seal mana source
has already vanished.</i>

27
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,368
<i>Since he doesn't use his
own Magic Circuits,</i>

28
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,913
<i>...the origin rounds' magic
won't work.</i>

29
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,332
<i>But if I can hit him...</i>

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,335
<i>...it'll still be strong enough
to kill him.</i>

31
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,797
<i>Don't think you'll escape next time.</i>

32
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,592
<i>Now that I know you're
moving at double speed,</i>

33
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,804
...I <i>simply need to adjust my timing
to compensate for it.</i>

34
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,401
<i>He's fast!</i>

35
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>The depth of your madness...</i>

36
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,095
<i>Is that my fault, as well?</i>

37
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,613
<i>My."</i>

38
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,117
<i>My...</i>

39
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,721
<i>Time Alter: Double Accel!</i>

40
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,981
<i>I'm at a massive disadvantage
at close range.</i>

41
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,649
<i>I've lost my Calico.</i>

42
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,402
<i>My Contender needs reloading.</i>

43
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:01,737
<i>However...</i>

44
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,655
<i>Avalon...</i>

45
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,790
<i>He has a healing ability that allows him to
instantly regenerate a demolished heart?</i>

46
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,668
<i>Then I'll have to destroy the brain.
But...</i>

47
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,505
<i>I can't use my right arm.</i>

48
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,758
<i>Avalon's healing powers will even
work on self-inflicted wounds...</i>

49
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,428
<i>I have a knife and
two grenades left.</i>

50
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,056
<i>I have twelve blades remaining.</i>

51
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,141
<i>And eight spare Command Seals.</i>

52
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,020
<i>Time Alter: Triple Accel!</i>

53
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,771
<i>Time Alter: Square Accel!</i>

54
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,410
Even so, I will win the Holy Grail.

55
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,204
If I do not,

56
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,833
...there will be nothing I can do
to atone to you.

57
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,550
Even after all of this...

58
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:33,805
...you would still take up your sword
for such a reason?

59
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,810
What a difficult person you are...

60
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,081
This is...

61
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,506
I knew you'd come.

62
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,345
I had faith that you would
reach this place.

63
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,973
<i>Iri.</i>

64
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,226
This is where your wish
will be granted...

65
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,188
We are inside the Grail you sought.

66
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,152
That is the Grail.

67
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:34,741
It has yet to take form,
but the vessel is more than filled.

68
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,995
All you need do now is
offer it your prayer.

69
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,791
Only then will it be
able to go outside.

70
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,669
Now, please...

71
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,463
Hurry, give it form.

72
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:54,511
Kiritsugu, you are worthy
to define its existence.

73
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,889
Who are you?

74
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,642
I am Irisviel.

75
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,685
No...

76
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,440
If the Grail is prepared,
then she is already...

77
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,401
Answer me!

78
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,573
True. I will not deny that
this is a mask.

79
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:20,203
Unless I use a pre-existing
personality as a shell,

80
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,497
...I cannot communicate with others.

81
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:28,962
However, the personality of Irisviel that
I recorded is inarguably the real thing.

82
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:34,051
And so, I have inherited
her last wish.

83
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,511
Are you the will of the Holy Grail?

84
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,641
Yes. That interpretation is not incorrect.

85
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,186
I have a will... A wish.

86
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,105
The will to be born
into the world.

87
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,440
Impossible.

88
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:54,071
In that case, how does the Grail
intend to grant my wish?

89
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,491
That is something, Kiritsugu,

90
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,621
...that you should know
better than anyone.

91
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,955
What?

92
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:09,252
You learned how to save the
world a long time ago.

93
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,090
So I will do as you did,

94
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:17,594
...to carry out your will,
and to answer your prayer.

95
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,055
What are you talking about?

96
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,725
I suppose I have no choice.

97
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:29,022
The only way is to have you ask
your inner self.

98
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,071
Where am I?

99
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,660
<i>Three hundred on one ship.</i>

100
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,246
<i>Two hundred on another.</i>

101
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,497
What?

102
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,542
<i>Five hundred total
passengers and crew,</i>

103
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,585
<i>...plus Kiritsugu Emiya.</i>

104
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:56,091
<i>Let's posit that these five hundred and one
are humanity's last survivors.</i>

105
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,971
<i>Giant holes simultaneously open up
in both ships, crippling them.</i>

106
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,933
<i>Kiritsugu alone has the
skills needed to repair a ship.</i>

107
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,813
<i>Now then,
which ship would you fix?</i>

108
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,650
<i>Obviously, the one with three
hundred people.</i>

109
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,111
<i>As soon as you make
that decision,</i>

110
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:21,700
<i>...the two hundred passengers on
the other ship take you prisoner.</i>

111
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,411
<i>They demand that you
fix their ship first.</i>

112
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,371
<i>So what will you do?</i>

113
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,915
I'd...

114
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,945
<i>Kill all two hundred.</i>

115
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,699
<i>That is correct.
That is what Kiritsugu Emiya would do.</i>

116
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:11,291
Next, the surviving three hundred
abandon their damaged craft,

117
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,170
...split themselves between two new ships,
and continue their journey.

118
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,717
This time, there are two hundred on one.
One hundred on the other.

119
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:26,765
But again, holes open in the hulls
of both ships at the same time.

120
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,724
Wait.

121
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:32,270
The hundred in the
smaller ship take you prisoner,

122
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,857
...demanding that you
fix their ship first.

123
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,526
Now, what will you do?

124
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,153
You already know.
But...

125
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,922
Yes, you made the right decision.

126
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,090
Impossible...

127
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,634
That's impossible!
How can that be the right decision?

128
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,886
Two hundred survived...

129
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,972
But three hundred died
so they could live!

130
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,516
The scales are tipped
the wrong way!

131
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,561
No, your calculations were correct.

132
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:17,190
You chose to sacrifice the few
to save the many.

133
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,235
Isn't that right, Kiritsugu Emiya?

134
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,781
You have always chosen to kill those
on the lighter side of the scales.

135
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,703
Even if it meant leaving a long
trail of bodies behind you.

136
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:35,250
If it saved lives, the lives of the saved
must have been worth more.

137
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,840
This is what you wanted
to show me?

138
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,093
Yes. This is your truth.

139
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,971
The answer that lies
within Kiritsugu Emiya.

140
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,851
In short, the course of action that should be taken
by the Grail as an all-powerful wish granter.

141
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,979
No...
This isn't what I want!

142
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,274
I want there to be another way!

143
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,070
That's why I believed that
a miracle was my only hope!

144
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,367
Your wish cannot include
a method you yourself don't know.

145
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,704
If you wish to save the world,

146
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,249
...it must be done in a way
that you comprehend.

147
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,751
Like hell!

148
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,630
How the hell
can you call that a miracle?!

149
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,090
But it is.

150
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:30,513
The deed that you tried and
failed to do on your own...

151
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,850
...can be accomplished on a scale
beyond the power of any man.

152
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,312
If that is not a miracle, what is?

153
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,110
Dad...

154
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,411
Natalia!

155
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:02,045
Kiritsugu Emiya,
you truly are Angra Mainyu.

156
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,590
The one worthy to bear
all the evil in the world.

157
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,344
Now, the final question.

158
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,682
Three remain.

159
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,270
Will you save two?

160
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,356
Or choose one?

161
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,370
Welcome home, Kiritsugu!

162
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,374
You're finally back!

163
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,836
You understand now, right?

164
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,590
This is the Holy Grail
granting your prayer.

165
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,389
All you need do now
is to wish for it.

166
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,100
To bring back your wife.

167
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,102
To take back your daughter.

168
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,239
I won't be able to go looking for
chestnuts with you anymore.

169
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,074
It's okay.

170
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:18,455
I'm happy,
as long as you and Mother are with me.

171
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,789
Thank you...

172
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,418
Daddy loves you, too, Ilya.

173
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,838
If nothing else, I swear
that to be true.

174
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,472
Good bye,

175
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:37,807
Ilya.

176
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,976
“Ilya!

177
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,979
"Ilya, Ilya, Ilya...

178
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,816
Ilya! Ilya...

179
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,195
Why?! Why would you do this?!

180
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,990
My love, you killed our Ilya!

181
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,456
M-My love...

182
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,792
Wh-Why?

183
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,504
Why do you refuse us?

184
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,466
Refuse us and the Grail?

185
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,514
Six billion people...

186
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,517
I curse you,

187
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,646
...Kiritsugu... Emiya.

188
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,356
Versus two family members...

189
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,360
Angra Mainyu curses you...

190
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,277
I...

191
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,780
Suffer...

192
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:34,614
I...

193
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,865
...until the day you die.

194
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,994
- I will kill you...
- I will...

195
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,748
And I will save the world.

196
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,167
...never forgive--

197
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,071
What a boring conclusion.

198
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,533
Why did you refuse it?

199
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,244
You saw that, too?

200
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,622
I thought you sacrificed
everything you had...

201
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,417
...to make it this far.

202
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,670
How can you deny the
worth of something...

203
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,298
...you worked so hard to attain?

204
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,426
It's so foolish,
I cannot understand it.

205
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:42,098
Its cost is greater
than any benefit it offers.

206
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,142
That's all.

207
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,854
That thing is no
omnipotent wish-granter.

208
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,606
Then give it to me!

209
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,569
You may not need it,
but I do!

210
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,112
If it...

211
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,115
If it is given life,

212
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:04,120
...then it can certainly answer
my every doubt.

213
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,874
It longs for a life of its own!
For its own birth!

214
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,585
Please, don't kill it!

215
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,003
That's...

216
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:22,597
No, you are so foolish that
I can't understand you.

217
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,609
Irisviel...

218
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,655
You're late, Saber.

219
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,616
I realize that you were enjoying
yourself with your old mad dog,

220
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,995
...but it is imprudent in the extreme
to keep me waiting.

221
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,455
Archer...

222
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:54,504
Look at that expression,
like that of a ravenous, wild dog.

223
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,507
Get out of the way...

224
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,803
The Holy Grail belongs to me!

225
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:10,144
Saber, it is when you are delusional
and crawling in the dirt...

226
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,648
...that you are at your most beautiful.

227
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,527
Lay down your blade
and be my wife.

228
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,155
A Grail that grants miracles?

229
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,660
Where is the sense in obsessing
over something so dubious?

230
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,457
Abandon these foolish
ideals and vows of yours.

231
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,378
From now on, seek only me,
and devote yourself to me alone.

232
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,716
If you do,
I swear, as king of all creation,

233
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,344
...that I shall give you every pleasure
the world has to offer.

234
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,266
You would steal the
Holy Grail from me?

235
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,685
For such nonsense?!

236
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,691
I was not asking your opinion.

237
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,235
I am informing you
of my decision!

238
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,698
Now, let us hear your response.

239
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,742
I refuse! I would never--

240
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,705
Shyness has left you
at a loss for words, I see.

241
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,248
That's fine...

242
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,043
You may give the wrong answer
as many times as you like.

243
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,462
If you would learn the
joy of serving me,

244
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,174
...you must first learn pain.

245
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,725
<i>Kiritsugu...</i>

246
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,399
Then you have finally
made your decision.

247
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:43,029
In the name of Kiritsugu Emiya,
I order you with my Command Seal...

248
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,032
<i>Give me the Holy Grail.</i>

249
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,035
Saber, use your Noble Phantasm...

250
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,537
...to destroy the Grail.

251
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,044
Impossible...
What are you doing, Saber?!

252
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,046
No!

253
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,425
By my third Command Seal,
I order you again...

254
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,178
Why, Kiritsugu?

255
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,348
You, of all people... Why?!

256
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,058
Curse you...

257
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,311
You dare interrupt my
wedding ceremony, mongrel?!

258
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,398
Saber, destroy...

259
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,817
Stop!

260
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,443
...the Grail.

261
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,073
Episode 24:
The Last Command Seal

262
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:32,870
Doushite sora wa konna ni aoku te
Why is the sky so blue?

263
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:37,917
Nani mo kanashimi wo shiranu youni
As if it knows nothing of sadness,

264
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,968
Itsumo tamerawazu ashita he to kuzure ochiru
it always caves into tomorrow without hesitation.

265
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:54,100
Inochi wa tarinai mama umarete kuruno ne
When souls are born, they're lacking something, aren't they?

266
00:23:54,183 --> 00:24:01,983
Kake ochita kokoro ni anata ga furete
You touch my broken heart.

267
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,904
Futari de yuku mirai wa
The future we're heading towards together

268
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:12,827
Kegare no nai tsuyosa de
with unsullied strength.

269
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,832
Sora wa takaku kaze wa utau
The sky is high and the wind sings.

270
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:22,920
Yume wo miteta Yorokobi he to
I had a dream to reach joy.

271
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:27,800
Hito wa itsuka tadori tsukeru
Everyone will reach the goal some day.

272
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:35,391
Kodomo no hitomi de anata wa shinjita
You believed that with childlike, pure eyes.

273
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,935
Soba ni iruyo
I'm here at your side

274
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:42,899
Koori tsuita mori wo nuke te
while passing through this frozen forest

275
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:49,447
Sono hitomi ga sekai no nageki ni
so that your eyes won't be distracted

276
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,411
Mayowanu you ni
by the grief of the world.

277
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,124
I remember that face...

278
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,086
With tears in his eyes,
and joy filling his heart...

279
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,880
It was a man.

280
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,883
The man was grateful to
someone or something.

281
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,719
<i>Next Time: Fate] Zero
“Thank you,“ he said.</i>

282
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,094
<i>Next Time:
Fate I Zero</i>
