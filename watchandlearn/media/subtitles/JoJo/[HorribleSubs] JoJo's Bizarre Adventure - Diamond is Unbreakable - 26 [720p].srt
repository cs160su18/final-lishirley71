00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,110
The old woman in Egypt, Enyaba, told me

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,450
to shoot the arrow at those it desires.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,360
They will become allies.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,180
Those shot with the arrow

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,450
will be able to bring out just one
special power hidden in their heats.

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,000
I believe she called them Stands.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,800
Jotaro Kujo and the others...

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,720
If there are others in Morioh
who are after my Yoshikage,

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,140
then I need to make more
Stand users, more allies.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,110
Now, arrow! Who do you want?

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,900
Choose! Choose them!

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,900
Pull

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,110
A telephone pole?

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,360
How is the telephone pole relev—

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,950
Could it be... you want that child?

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,350
Are you saying that child will be my ally?

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,190
V-Very well.

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,340
I just have to shoot that child, right?

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,680
Diamond is Unbreakable

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,680
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,440
Diamond is Unbreakable

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,440
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

24
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,610
Episode 26      Janken Boy Is Coming!

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,840
Well, if it isn't the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe.

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,060
Good morning, Mr. Joestar.

27
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,210
What are you shooting here?

28
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,450
I was sneaking some photos of
businessmen heading to work.

29
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,480
If Yoshikage Kira switched places
with someone at Salon Cinderella,

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,280
he should be going to work every
day, just like that person did.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,820
Going to work...

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,710
Knowing he's a man between
the ages of 25 and 35

33
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,600
who's around 175 centimeters
tall and an office worker

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,250
narrows it down quite a bit.

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,580
I see...

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,000
But you can't be sure that he uses the station.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,430
He might drive to work in a car.

38
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,920
That is possible.

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,730
But he only changed his face.

40
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,930
I don't think it's possible to change
completely into someone else.

41
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm pretty sure that the family of
one of these men is already

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,030
starting to think he's acting bizarre.

43
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,430
What worries me is that,
if the family finds Kira out,

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,530
there's a possibility Kira will
get rid of that family.

45
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,430
I'm not trying to preach justice or anything,

46
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,450
but I just want to find
Kira before that happens.

47
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,440
Hey!

48
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,710
Mister, would you play janken with me?

49
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,840
Janken...

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,830
Hey, come on. It wouldn't
hurt to play, would it?

51
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,220
What's with this kid?

52
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,780
Janken...

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,550
There's always at least one
weirdo at any station.

54
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,390
Anyway, if you find any clues,
please let me know, Mr. Joestar.

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,590
And you make sure you don't meddle
in anything dangerous alone.

56
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,820
Hey, Mister. You're the
manga artist guy, right?

57
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,730
Didn't your series take a break not long ago?

58
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,730
I read Shonen Jump weekly.

59
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,080
So come on. It wouldn't
hurt to play janken with me.

60
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,250
What's with you? Beat it!

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,130
I wanna play janken. Come on, please?

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,100
What's with this kid? He has a hole in his cheek!

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,000
I-It's deep.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,780
Hey, come on! Hey, hey!

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,780
Does it go all the way into his mouth?

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,850
No hard feelings if you lose.

67
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,360
If we tie, we play again.
If you shoot too late, you lose.

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,460
Got it? Ready, and...

69
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,610
Janken...

70
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,860
This brat is being oddly persistent.

71
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,370
Is he a Stand user?

72
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,000
Ready, and... Janken...

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Heaven's Door!

74
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,180
Hmph.

75
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,960
Let's see...

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,070
His name is Ken Oyanagi, and he's eleven.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,490
There's nothing about a Stand written here...

78
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,660
And it says the hole in his cheek was
from falling off a telephone pole.

79
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,490
Loves "janken."
Really wants to play "janken."
Plays "scissors" first.

80
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,590
It looks like this kid really wants to play janken.

81
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,540
It's stupid, but...

82
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,040
Hey, guys. Are you getting in or not?

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,950
Would you mind waiting about 30 seconds?

84
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,870
Here we go.

85
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,250
Yeah, all right. You just
want me to play, right?

86
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,520
Janken... hoi!

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,490
Well, see ya.

88
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,010
I... I lost...

89
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,850
I guess that's enough work for today.

90
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,010
Yo, Rohan-sensei.

91
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,010
Are you done with work already?

92
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,810
Why don't you sit down and chat for a bit?

93
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,820
It's the shitbag Josuke, the idiot Okuyasu...

94
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,030
And the moody Yukako.

95
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,000
All people with whom I have
nothing to talk about.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,330
Sorry, but I'm still working. Some other time.

97
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,590
I see...

98
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,470
Hey, what are you doing? That's my seat.

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,530
You haven't sat down yet, have you?

100
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,540
This seat was empty, so I sat down.

101
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,200
Whoops.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,650
What's with you? Why do you keep bugging me?

103
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,440
Let's use janken to decide
who gets the seat. Okay?

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,530
Again?!

105
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,200
No! I sat here first!

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,970
This seat belongs to me!

107
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,970
Sir...

108
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,000
Hang on...

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
Rohan-sensei, just let him have it.

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,380
He's just a kid.

111
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,490
Don't make him cry.
That's pretty immature of you.

112
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,010
Why don't you sit next to him?

113
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,130
Shut up! All of you, shut you mouths!

114
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,260
Fine! I'll play janken!

115
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,560
Janken's what you want, right?

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,330
That's the spirit! H-Here we go!

117
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,690
Janken... hoi!

118
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,730
Oh? Y-Yes, I won!

119
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,350
Take that!

120
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,370
I've never been so happy to
win at janken in my life.

121
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,610
So immature...

122
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,530
No, winning against a brat
is the best feeling there is.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,880
D-Damn it!

124
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,670
I can use this as reference material.

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,020
Who knew a book on such a minor
subject was being sold in Morioh?

126
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,100
7,500 yen, huh...

127
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,800
Do I have that much on me?

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,460
Excuse me, can I get this book?

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,590
Why, you little...

130
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,740
Wanna decide with janken?

131
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,490
Fine!

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,870
Here we go! Janken...

133
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,210
Rock!

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,480
Stop messing around!

135
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,990
I won. See?

136
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,010
I finally won!

137
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,980
One win, two losses!

138
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,100
What the hell is this?!

139
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,390
Wh—

140
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,690
What?!

141
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,690
I-Impossible! Th-The hole...

142
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,470
Could he be a Stand user?!

143
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,990
What?!

144
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,230
S-So cool!

145
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,830
I didn't know something
so cool would come out!

146
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,300
Beautiful and magnificent
energy is flowing into me!

147
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm feeling better!

148
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,400
H-Heaven's Door!

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,820
Make this kid into a book!

150
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,200
Open

151
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,300
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

152
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,470
This kid...

153
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,810
seemed to be bringing out his
own Stand for the first time.

154
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,090
Could he be on his way to becoming a Stand user?

155
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,320
Hmph. "I want to beat the crap
out of Rohan with janken," huh?

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,500
"Janken is not about probability.

157
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,950
It's all mental, dependent on
how much you want to win.

158
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,910
Beating Rohan at janken means
you've beaten him mentally.

159
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,920
Rohan Kishibe is only 20 years old,
and he's already facing the world alone.

160
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,090
Not to mention, he's awed
many people with his works.

161
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,340
If I beat the crap out of someone so widely
admired, it means I'd surpass them.

162
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,010
I want to grow up to be someone
people admire, just like Rohan."

163
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,850
So this kid really is on his way
to becoming a Stand user!

164
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,990
He must have only just been hit by the arrow.

165
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,140
"Ability... When I beat my opponent
in janken, their energy becomes mine.

166
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,740
However, we have to play five times.

167
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,620
If I don't win three times, I can't take all of it."

168
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,320
Play five times?

169
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,660
Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

170
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,240
attack Rohan Kishibe.

171
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,540
attack Rohan Kishibe.

172
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,330
Can attack Rohan Kishibe.

173
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,910
Wh-What?

174
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,170
That's so cool. So this
ability is called a "Stand"?

175
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,610
You may have thought you got away,

176
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,140
but I've already absorbed
one third of your Stand.

177
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,850
I-Its right arm is missing!

178
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,290
I can move one third of Heaven's Door!

179
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,510
I won't let you read my mind anymore.

180
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,840
You brat...

181
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,600
If I win two more times,
all of your ability will be mine!

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,490
You brat! Who do you think you are?!

183
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,850
You had some nerve to hit
me with your fist earlier.

184
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,260
That's payback, you moron!

185
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,960
It appears that in order to get
Heaven's Door's right arm back,

186
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,090
I'll have to win at janken...

187
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,580
Very well.

188
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,540
Good!

189
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
Match 2

190
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
Match 5

191
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
5 Matches

192
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
Match 4

193
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
Match 1

194
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,010
Match 3

195
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:49,430
He

196
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,520
Heav

197
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:49,640
Heaven

198
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,890
Heaven's

199
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:49,980
Heaven's Do

200
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,100
Heaven's Doo

201
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,020
Heaven's Door

202
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,730
Ro

203
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:50,840
Rohan

204
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:50,980
Rohan Kishi

205
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,020
Rohan Kishibe

206
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,120
Do you understand the situation you're in?

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,650
You can't lose again.

208
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,280
Do you understand that you're cornered?

209
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,840
Now that I know you're a Stand user,
I won't hold back anymore!

210
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,760
As soon as I get back my right arm,

211
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,450
I'm going to knock you out.

212
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,740
You know that, don't you?

213
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,790
Are you trying to pressure me?

214
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,310
All right, let's do this.

215
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,620
No, we're not doing that yet.

216
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,110
Since I just won using paper,

217
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,710
I would usually go with rock or scissors next,

218
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,800
but I think that might be childish.

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,240
But you don't seem that
simple-minded, Rohan-sensei,

220
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,680
so I was thinking about turning that
around and going with paper.

221
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,770
All right, I've got it.

222
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,570
Here we go!

223
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,660
Janken... hoi!

224
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,500
What?!

225
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,280
I did it! I forced my hand against
Rohan mentally, and won with paper!

226
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,740
5 Matches

227
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,740
Ken

228
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,740
Rohan

229
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,740
Now I've got two wins and two losses.

230
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,620
Now, then...

231
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,380
I took your lower half.

232
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,240
If you're tired, should we
head over to the bench?

233
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,650
No, there's no need.

234
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,210
When you win, it's best to be

235
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,260
looking down on your opponent just like this.

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,090
I've got two wins and two losses,

237
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,610
which means we're both on the edge.

238
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,660
But you know, I really don't feel
like I'm going to lose now.

239
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,670
After I lost twice at first,
I won twice in a row.

240
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,250
You're the opposite, Rohan-sensei.
You've lost twice in a row.

241
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,690
You're currently on the
downhill slope in this match!

242
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,020
This is amazing!

243
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,720
No wonder the arrow picked this kid!

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,850
If this kid is able to obtain
Rohan Kishibe's ability

245
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,300
to read minds, we'll be invincible!

246
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,330
It'll help out my Yoshikage.

247
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,370
You brat...

248
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,290
It seems you've gotten better
at pressuring your opponent.

249
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,700
It's the truth that you've lost twice in a row.

250
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,750
The truth, huh... Indeed.

251
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,020
In that case, let me give
you a dose of truth, as well.

252
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,710
In our next match, you will
definitely not use paper.

253
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,510
I'm not so sure about that.

254
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,930
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it.

255
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,020
I used rock twice in a row and lost.

256
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,050
Which means that rock is the
unluckiest choice for me.

257
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,520
Am I wrong?

258
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,250
It's only natural that I wouldn't be able
to use the unlucky rock a third time.

259
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,630
Since you said I was on a downhill slope,

260
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,650
you won't be able to use paper.

261
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,810
If you use paper, it's like admitting
that I am actually not going downhill.

262
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,210
I'll force my hand and beat you!

263
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,370
Let's go, Rohan Kishibe!

264
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,090
It's on!

265
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,830
Jan...

266
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,630
...ken...

267
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,670
...hoi!

268
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,080
After all that pressure, he still used paper.

269
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,580
His mental strength is remarkable.

270
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,560
There's no way I'll lose!

271
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,010
I definitely still have the
upper hand in this match!

272
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,270
I'll use paper four times in a row!
I'm gonna force my hand!

273
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,950
All right! Rock! I'll get the
unlucky rock on my side!

274
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,950
One more...

275
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,860
Th-The strength in my knees...

276
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,820
What? He's using a different
form than before!

277
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,900
The only one Rohan hasn't
used yet is scissors...

278
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,370
Crap... Going with paper again is dangerous!

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,880
Crap!

280
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,090
I guess rock wasn't unlucky after all!

281
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,180
Damn that Rohan!

282
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,970
Th-That's...

283
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,810
Hey, Mister!

284
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,880
Hey, Rohan-sensei. Those two are
probably Stand users, too, right?

285
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,200
They are, right? I can feel it.

286
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,720
Let's test my luck.

287
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,160
If I'm out of luck,
those two will come over here.

288
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,420
If I'm protected by strong luck,
they definitely won't come over here.

289
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,330
Hey, that's Rohan.

290
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,450
Hey! Hey!

291
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,450
I really hate that guy.

292
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,700
Let's just smile and walk away.

293
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,180
Hmm... Well, hmm...

294
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,710
Menacing

295
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,510
That child...

296
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,510
Menacing

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,030
I do believe he's...

298
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,760
a fan of his.

299
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,850
See you later.

300
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,220
See ya.

301
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,090
It looks like strong luck is
on my side, Rohan-sensei.

302
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,750
I feel like there's no way I can lose right now,

303
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,780
because I'm protected by strong luck!

304
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,210
Right now, I feel like I could
survive Russian roulette

305
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,450
with five out of six bullets in the chamber!

306
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,400
Crash

307
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,090
It's a shower of glass!

308
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,900
Now, let's have our final match
to see who'll win, Rohan-sensei!

309
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
What are you doing?

310
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,820
Hurry up and get into your janken pose.

311
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,040
You're the one who needs to
hurry up and get started.

312
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,610
I'm going to go with this.

313
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,900
Stop messing around.

314
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,660
No, I'm dead serious.

315
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,230
You said you were going to surpass me,

316
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,920
but since I've lived nine years longer
than you, I'll let you in on something...

317
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,670
It's not very hard to make others lose.

318
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,360
The most difficult thing is...
Listen carefully, now...

319
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,350
The most difficult thing is

320
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,160
to surpass yourself!

321
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,060
I'm now going to surpass my own luck!

322
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,110
Let's go, Rohan!

323
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,360
It's on!

324
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,570
Janken hoi!

325
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,730
Yes! How's that, Rohan Kishibe?!

326
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,420
Wh-What?

327
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,080
What?!

328
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,080
Huh?

329
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,190
Wh-What the?

330
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,710
Why is my hand shaped as rock?!

331
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,630
Now I have three wins and two losses.

332
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,680
You have the unlucky rock.

333
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,090
Strong luck came to me a moment ago,
along with Joseph Joestar.

334
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,000
The Invisible Baby.

335
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,020
Huh?!

336
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,400
Will save Rohan when he's in danger.
Will become invisible and make the kid's hand into "rock."

337
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,970
You only relied on your strong
luck, and I changed my luck.

338
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,320
That's what it means to surpass yourself.

339
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,060
Boom

340
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,770
Now, then. I'm going to knock
you out now, as I promised.

341
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,420
I'll write,

342
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,250
"You'll never be able to win at janken again.

343
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,760
Your Stand will be destroyed."

344
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,340
Sh-Shut up!

345
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,200
Stay away from me, Rohan!

346
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,140
O-Otherwise, this baby's gonna...

347
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,480
Do you understand what you're doing?

348
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,410
Hmph! Right now, our match
is a verbal argument!

349
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,470
You haven't really won against me!

350
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,040
You won because you cheated, you coward!

351
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,570
Let the baby go.

352
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,330
Fight me one more time!

353
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,780
Then I won't do anything to this baby.

354
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,200
And I'm telling you to let the baby go.

355
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll fight you.

356
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:05,300
I'll make you lose! Janken, hoi! Hoi! Hoi!

357
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,720
I-I-I can't win!

358
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,280
D-Damn it! I made you into a
Stand user and you still lost!

359
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
See ya!

360
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,930
You won't die.

361
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,650
I'm just going to destroy your Stand.

362
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,700
If...

363
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,880
If I have to obey what you write...

364
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,790
If I'm going to be mentally controlled by you...

365
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,300
I'd rather die like this!

366
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,670
Take that, Rohan Kishibe!

367
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,970
Pfft

368
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,850
Nice. I like you, kid.

369
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,270
I feel moved when I see people who are...

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,250
Dash

371
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,880
dramatic like you!

372
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,670
Wha?!

373
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,610
Y-You'll be run over, too!

374
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,450
You think so?

375
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,760
What the? Th-The wind!

376
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,240
Whoa, what the hell is this picture?!

377
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,620
I-I can't see in front of me!

378
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,160
I-It avoided us and drove by?

379
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,510
Y-You could have died, too,
but you did that for me...

380
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,600
Was it strong luck?

381
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,660
You've become quite impressive
in such a short time.

382
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,730
I won't knock you out.

383
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,410
However, don't use that
Stand for evil anymore.

384
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,160
I carelessly bumped into it, damn it!

385
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,790
I lost. I've completely lost.

386
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,120
Hey, Rohan!

387
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,040
D-Did you see the baby?

388
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,130
She's missing, Sensei!

389
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,920
N-No, it might be that we just can't see her.

390
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,290
C-Crap...

391
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,220
She's gone.

392
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,140
Hey, where are you?

393
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,310
I'll just pretend I don't know
and look with them...

394
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,590
Wh-Where did you go? Where are you?

395
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,820
Janken Kid. Real name: Ken Oyanagi.

396
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,600
Hey!

397
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,100
Stand name: Boys Man Man.

398
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,590
Unable to fight.

399
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,160
For some reason, the hole
in his cheek is still there.
