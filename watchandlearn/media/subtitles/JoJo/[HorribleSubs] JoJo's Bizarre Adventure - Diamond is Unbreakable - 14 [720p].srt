00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,170
Today was another exhausting day.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,730
I just want to hurry home so I can relax.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,760
K-Koichi...

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,830
Hazamada...

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,080
Hey, how are you doing?

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,850
Th-Thanks for everything the other day.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,870
Um, are you all healed up now?

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,790
Kinda. I was released from
the hospital two days ago.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,860
Where's that bastard—
I mean, where's Josuke?

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,730
He already went home.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,020
Apparently, he found an
invisible baby yesterday,

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,810
and there was a big fuss
over finding her mother.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,870
Is she a Stand user?

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,190
Apparently.

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,780
The baby has only warmed up to
Josuke's father, Mr. Joestar,

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
and if he's not around, she turns
everything around her invisible.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,860
So is Mr. Joestar going to be
in town for a while, then?

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,400
Probably.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,710
I see. By the way, Koichi,
do you like to read manga?

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,590
Manga? Oh, I guess about as much as anyone.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,390
Have you heard of Rohan Kishibe,
who draws Pink Dark Boy?

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,910
Pink Dark Boy? Of course!

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,300
I'm a huge fan!

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,960
Yeah? You like it?

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,890
I guess you'd call it "horror suspense."

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,330
There are some pretty gross scenes,

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,310
but the thrills that seem to close in on you

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,080
and the realistic characters
are great, aren't they?

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,400
Right, right!

31
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,320
Did you know that Rohan Kishibe
actually lives in Morioh?

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,070
Huh?!

33
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,820
What?! He lives in Morioh?!

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,220
No way! You can't be serious! Really?!

35
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,240
I couldn't believe it, either!

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,500
But I happened to overhear
some realtors talking.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,700
I know it seems unbelievable, but it's true!

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,620
Hey, want to go see if we
can get some autographs?

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,130
Morioh Station

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,550
Rohan Kishibe's House

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,550
Yes! Of course I'll go!

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,170
Looks like we think alike!

43
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,550
Really?

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,060
Kishibe

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,380
Over there!

46
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,580
I think that might be his studio.

47
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,920
The light's on!

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,480
You're right...

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,100
I wonder if he has any other family.

50
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,230
I heard he lives alone.

51
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,030
He debuted at sixteen, and now he's twenty.

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,760
Twenty?! He's so young!

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,080
So he became a pro at my age.

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,310
There's no point in snooping around, Koichi.

55
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,840
Try ringing the doorbell.

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,580
M-Me?

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,860
Oh, come on! I'm ordering
you, as an older student.

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,840
I tend to get pretty nervous.

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,780
What? That's not fair...

60
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,770
Episode 14  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1

61
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,950
That face!

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,370
Rohan Kishibe!

63
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,970
He looks just like his picture
in the New Year's deluxe edition!

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,140
Uh, I mean... Rohan-sensei!

65
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,620
H-Huh?

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,210
Who are you two?

67
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,360
What are you doing? Playing a prank?

68
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,250
N-No! We would never!

69
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,100
Um, we're students at Budogaoka High School.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,370
W-We're fans of yours, Sensei.

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,430
Fans? Of mine? You're readers?

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,270
So my address has gotten out.

73
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,940
N-No, um... I just happened to overhear it.

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,140
So, I know this is sudden,

75
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,320
but it would make us really happy
if we could get your autograph.

76
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,170
Fans of mine, eh?

77
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,830
That's good.

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,910
We might be on the same wavelength, then.

79
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,720
Huh?

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,330
Nothing, never mind. Pardon.

81
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,260
An autograph or two is no problem at all.

82
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,540
Yes! I guess it's a good thing we came.

83
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,050
I know.

84
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,960
Since you're here, would you
like a tour of my studio?

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,690
Huh?

86
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,090
You'll let us go into your studio?!

87
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,970
I'm already done with my work for
the day, so if you two would like...

88
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,810
Of course!

89
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,800
Then...

90
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,390
Pardon the intrusion!

91
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,450
Come in.

92
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,410
Wow!

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,980
Wow! Raw 4-color manuscript!

94
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,000
This is amazing! It has so much more impact!

95
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,670
I-I'm so moved! I-I-I'm so glad that we came!

96
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,780
How long have you been working in Morioh?

97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,100
I moved here three months ago.

98
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
My family home is in S City,

99
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,020
but I lived here for a time when I was a child.

100
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,300
Tokyo is very convenient,
but it's pretty chaotic.

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,000
The environment is nowhere near

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,860
as calm as it is in Morioh,
and I can't work there.

103
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,780
Not to mention,

104
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,400
with the fax machines and
copiers we have these days,

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
I have a system where, given four hours,

106
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,330
I can send in a complete manuscript.

107
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,620
You could say there's no point in living in

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,040
the city now, other than for pointless status.

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,210
Um... So what do you do
for assistants or staff?

110
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,290
I don't have any. I draw it all by myself.

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,510
Huh? All by yourself?!

112
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,220
You draw 19 pages of such
elaborate art in just one week?!

113
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,170
I can draw them in four days.
Five if there are color pages.

114
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,620
What?!

115
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,040
On the remaining days, I have
fun going on trips and such.

116
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,930
I don't really like dealing with people,

117
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,230
and that's why I chose to be a manga artist.

118
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,100
If I had an assistant,
it'd be harder for me to work.

119
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,140
That's so amazing... Wow.

120
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,890
You're a genius!

121
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,470
Pardon me for a moment.

122
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,780
Whoa, a s-spider!

123
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,560
We really are out in the burbs.

124
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,530
There are a lot of bugs and spiders.

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,410
Um... Sensei?

126
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,920
I see... So this spider is
an Araneus ventricosus...

127
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,330
It can be found in houses and
mountainous regions all across Japan.

128
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,200
Though it is an orb-weaver,

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,550
there are some that make webs day and night.

130
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,610
By the way,

131
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,250
do you two know what it takes
to draw an interesting manga?

132
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,870
Reality!

133
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,400
Reality is the energy that breathes
life into a piece of work,

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,340
and reality itself is entertainment.

135
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,880
People often think that manga are
drawn from imagination and fantasy,

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
but that's not actually true!

137
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,110
For me, drawing something
that I've experienced,

138
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,070
or something that has moved me,
is what makes it interesting!

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,160
For example, in the city, people would just
be grossed out by this spider and kill it.

140
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,160
As a manga artist, you need to
know how its legs are connected,

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,130
where the eyes are, and how to tell
the difference between a male

142
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,590
and a female in order to be able to draw it.

143
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,220
Apparently a spider's webbing hardens
when it's exposed to the air,

144
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,180
but you have to know what
hole it comes from,

145
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,440
and what its innards look like.

146
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,920
When a spider's belly is cut upon,
how does it suffer before it dies?

147
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,990
You have to know these things
for the sake of reality.

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,820
That's so cruel!

149
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,010
Cruel?!

150
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,120
An amateur brat like you is
criticizing me, Rohan Kishibe?!

151
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,210
N-No! I wasn't criticizing at all! I'm sorry!

152
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,080
I should have a taste, too.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,590
Manga artists are really strange people,
just as the world perceives them!

154
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,760
Very nice! That agonized expression...

155
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
Perfect example of how one looks when puking!

156
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,430
I should sketch it.

157
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,140
R-Really?

158
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,390
Now it looks fake.

159
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,310
Forget it. I won't sketch it.

160
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,870
It won't be of any use.

161
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,660
I-I'm sorry.

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,990
Autographs, wasn't it?

163
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,520
I'll go get a signing pen from the kitchen,

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,610
and bring out some tea, as well.

165
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,360
Oh, you don't have to...

166
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,590
But that's amazing! I had no idea...

167
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,180
Pink Dark Boy must be so amazing

168
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,740
because of how far he goes to
figure out all kinds of things...

169
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,530
Um, Hazamada...

170
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,800
I know we just got here, but, um...

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,300
Maybe we should go home.

172
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,320
Huh? Go home? You want to go home? Why?

173
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,230
This is a lot of fun!

174
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,530
I don't really have a reason, but...

175
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,790
I guess you could call it a hunch.

176
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,490
Though I'm not usually that perceptive...

177
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,580
I just suddenly got the feeling that
Rohan-sensei is a bit dangerous.

178
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,870
Dangerous?

179
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,330
Do you mean that he might be a Stand user?

180
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,170
No! Nothing like that. Just, um...

181
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,330
Just because Rohan-sensei's a bit unusual,

182
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,870
I don't think you should just
assume that he's a Stand user.

183
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,140
I'm not assuming that he is...

184
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,060
I just said I have a bad feeling.

185
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,190
Besides, if Rohan-sensei
actually is a Stand user,

186
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,060
wouldn't that be great for us?

187
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,410
That means I have something in common
with a famous manga artist.

188
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,450
But, all right.

189
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,540
If you have a bad feeling,
we can go home for today.

190
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,120
We can always come again.

191
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
But!

192
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,660
Only after I've looked at this
thing that caught my eye.

193
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,360
Thing? What thing?

194
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
Jeez, you're dense, Koichi!

195
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,950
On top of the desk, next to the phone.

196
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,670
Look carefully.

197
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,650
Oh! C-Could this be...

198
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,340
Yup! He said he just finished working, right?

199
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,290
I've been eyeing that carefully.

200
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,770
A manuscript for Pink Dark Boy
that's just been finished?!

201
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,690
Does that mean no one else
has even seen it yet?!

202
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,200
Once I get a glimpse of this, we can go home.

203
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,570
We should get permission first.

204
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,260
Koichi, you don't know manga artists at all.

205
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,630
These manuscripts, before
they've gone to the printers,

206
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,960
are a closely-guarded trade secret!

207
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,360
There's no way he'd let us outsiders read a

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,510
manuscript that hasn't even
been checked by the editor yet!

209
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,400
I'll have a look, then put it right back.

210
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,270
That's an even worse idea!

211
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,250
It's fine! It's not like it can hurt anything.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,480
Huh?

213
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,100
What is this feeling?

214
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,840
It's always a thrilling manga, but is
this the impact of a raw manuscript?

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm getting goosebumps!

216
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,900
It's so good!

217
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,570
Hurry up and turn the page, Hazamada.

218
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm so moved!

219
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,080
It appears

220
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,970
that my manuscript was compatible
with you two after all.

221
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,090
I thought you would read it.

222
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,800
And only those who are the first to read
my manuscript, and are compatible...

223
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,540
H-Hazamada...

224
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,680
K-Koichi...

225
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,120
...will have their hearts opened
by my ability, Heaven's Door!

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,020
A-Ability?!

227
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,780
My hand!

228
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,080
K-Koichi! What's going on?!

229
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,090
Morioh Landmark 5
Manga Artist Rohan Kishibe's House
Get off at the Morioh Kotodai 2-chome
bus stop and walk 1 minute.
Area: A mansion situated on 103 tsubo of land.
7LDK plus an attic.
If you actually go, he'll pretend to be out.

230
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,840
There are a lot of things
recorded in the human body.

231
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,340
Everything from the moment you were born.

232
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,930
In order to read that, I will
turn you both into books.

233
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,220
Books that have your lives written in them.

234
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,010
Help!

235
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,610
You read the manga too, didn't you?

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,150
It's happening to me, too!

237
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,150
Hazamada!

238
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,660
This will cause you no actual
harm, so don't worry.

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,490
Wh-What are you trying to do?!

240
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,000
I told you earlier that for manga, the author's
sense of reality is important, right?

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,860
Which means reading about your lives and

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,380
experiences will offer me realistic ideas.

243
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,850
You can't get this from interviews!

244
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,220
You're going to tell me 100% realistically,
as if I had experienced it myself.

245
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:37,150
Koichi Hirose. Born March 28th, 1984,
at 6:27 AM at Red Cross Hospital in S City.

246
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,530
You were born premature at 2325 grams,
and spent a week in an incubator.

247
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,660
You're from a family of four,
and your older sister's name is Ayana...

248
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,070
I see...

249
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,240
It appears that your grade school and
middle school days were pretty ordinary,

250
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,960
and your personality is very honest.

251
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,480
That's very commendable.

252
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,500
You...

253
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,260
What is this ability that you have?! Reverb?

254
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,510
Someone other than me has an ability like this?!

255
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,030
You, too?

256
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,850
"Stand users!" This is...

257
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,920
Everything from April of 1999 on is amazing!

258
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,660
You've only had amazing
experiences ever since!

259
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,470
Josuke Higashikata, Jotaro Kujo,

260
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,420
Yukako Yamagishi, Okuyasu
Nijimura, Tamami Kobayashi...

261
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,390
I can't believe it...

262
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,440
This is amazing! It's so entertaining!

263
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,370
I just discovered the best material a manga
artist could hope for, Koichi Hirose!

264
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,090
Shining Diamond,

265
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,770
Star Platinum,

266
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,550
The Hand, Love Deluxe, et cetera, et cetera!

267
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,220
Wh-What do you plan on doing with us?!

268
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,390
I'm going to take your memories

269
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,020
so I can use them as material for my manga!

270
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,810
Reverb!

271
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,210
Please stop attacking us
with your Stand immediately!

272
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,570
Otherwise...

273
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Are you going to have Reverb
Act 2 attack me with sound?

274
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,470
Yes! Please release me from your Stand!

275
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,280
I won't hold back!

276
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,670
I know. It's written on your 11th page.

277
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,470
You're far more timid than most people
and taken rather lightly by others,

278
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,410
but when it's necessary, you have
courage that can overpower your fear.

279
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,910
Truly magnificent!

280
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,430
I'm very impressed with you!

281
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm sure my readers will
like your personality, too.

282
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm not bluffing! I'm really
going to attack you!

283
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
Oh, shut up...

284
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,360
And just try it!

285
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,070
Reverb Act 2!

286
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Crash

287
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,060
Crash

288
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,460
Huh? I-I missed?!

289
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,870
Did you accidentally miss
or did you miss on purpose?

290
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,600
Your control is way off!

291
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,380
Then how about this?!

292
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,530
Crash

293
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,390
Where are you attacking?!

294
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,840
Koichi, sadly for you, I have
put a safety lock on Reverb.

295
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,520
Huh?

296
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,270
You are now unable to attack me.

297
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,270
Safety lock?

298
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,910
Look... I've already written it into
your 11th page, right here.

299
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,580
I can not attack the manga
artist, Rohan Kishibe

300
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,290
I can not
attack the
manga
artist,
Rohan
Kishibe.

301
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,670
c

302
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,040
an

303
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,420
n

304
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,960
ot

305
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,420
can not

306
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,550
This is Heaven's Door's ability.

307
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,980
It lets me read people's experiences
via words and pictures,

308
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,150
and it also allows me to
write into your memories.

309
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:01,140
You will now never be able to harm
me in any way, shape, or form.

310
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,150
Wh-What?!

311
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,980
But that's all I'm going to mess with.

312
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,710
If I write in any more,
it'll make your life fake,

313
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,240
so it wouldn't benefit my work at all.

314
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,470
Let's see... I guess I'll
have a look at Hazamada, too.

315
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,540
Sensei! You are a genius! I admire you!

316
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,300
Huh... I see.

317
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,660
Let's see...

318
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,960
You sometimes feel relief after you've

319
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,550
picked on things weaker than yourself,
like kittens and small birds.

320
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,040
You want to force yourself on Junko from 3-E,

321
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,060
but you're too cowardly, so you can't.

322
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,760
Your balls often get sweaty,

323
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,840
and when you're adjusting them during class,

324
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,160
nothing gives you a greater thrill than
the thought that someone might see you.

325
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,650
You're an awful man.

326
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,130
There's no way my readers would like
you if I wrote you into my manga.

327
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,970
You're useless.

328
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,530
No fair! There's no hope for me!

329
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,530
Why?

330
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Why are you doing this?

331
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,860
Even without reading about my experiences,
you're an amazing manga artist!

332
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,890
The world knows that!

333
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,620
You're living in this amazing
house at the age of twenty!

334
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,180
You're doing much better
than most people your age!

335
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,520
And yet, why do you need my memories?!

336
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,910
Do you think that I,
Rohan Kishibe, draw manga

337
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,690
for the sake of money and attention?!

338
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm drawing manga so people will read it!

339
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,830
So someone will read it!
That's the only reason!

340
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,120
It's a very simple reason, but I
don't care about anything else!

341
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,290
So that people will read it,
I look for realistic material every day!

342
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,630
Listen well. Whenever I finish
a manuscript, I feel amazing.

343
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,970
Everyone feels great after
finishing work, don't they?

344
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,940
But that feeling only lasts for an instant.

345
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,310
It's only a little while,

346
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,340
because I start thinking that no one's
going to read my completed manga,

347
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,350
and my insecurities start to grow.

348
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,940
Then I get even more insecure
because, maybe next week,

349
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,610
no one's going to read it, and
then I might not know what

350
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,430
to draw anymore, and I might not
feel like doing anything anymore.

351
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,730
These feelings have been reoccurring
over and over since I was sixteen.

352
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,730
Until three months ago,
when someone shot me with an arrow,

353
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,590
and I gained the ability of Heaven's Door.

354
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,660
Keicho Nijimura...

355
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,090
Yes, that was also written in you.

356
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,340
I'm sure you two don't understand
the feeling of having found

357
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,760
the best material to use
for drawing a masterpiece!

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
But this is it, right now!

359
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,060
It's the best!

360
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,230
Koichi, I'm going to make your reality mine!

361
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,170
See, Koichi? Wasn't Rohan-sensei a great guy?

362
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,780
Aren't you glad we went?

363
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,040
Yeah! It was so much fun!

364
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,550
To Hirose
Rohan Kishibe

365
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,640
Not only did he give us
these great autographs,

366
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,120
he even served us tea and cookies.

367
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,080
I'd love to go again.

368
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,330
Yeah. Let's definitely go again.

369
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,560
Well, I'm heading this way, so...

370
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,810
He really was a great guy.

371
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,780
You'll never speak of this, Koichi.

372
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,780
Huh?!

373
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,530
Wh-Why?!

374
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,410
How did I lose 20 kilograms?

375
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,960
But I don't look any different!

376
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,500
It reads five kilograms...

377
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,340
The scale's not broken.

378
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,600
Th-This is impossible!

379
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,850
Th-This has to be the work
of an enemy Stand user!

380
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,210
Otherwise, there's no way
I'd lose 20 kilograms!

381
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,940
But who...

382
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,530
I need to talk to Josuke about this.

383
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,660
What's the matter, Ko?

384
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,580
Huh?

385
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,880
Me? U-Uh...

386
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,080
Wait... What was it?

387
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,340
What are you talking about? Weirdo.

388
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,570
What's wrong?

389
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,620
Oh, nothing. My little brother's
wandering around in his underwear.

390
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,120
What was it?

391
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,390
I could have sworn I thought about
something really important just now.

392
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,040
Well, if I forgot about it,
it can't be that important.

393
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,730
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

394
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,610
Huh?

395
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,360
Th-This house...

396
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,890
Why?

397
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,140
I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

398
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,330
The door's open...

399
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,500
I'd like to stop by and thank him for yesterday,

400
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,140
but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

401
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,620
He might actually still be asleep
since he's a manga artist.

402
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,080
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

403
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,630
It's really not a good idea...

404
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,560
Hey, did you see that, Okuyasu?

405
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,820
Yeah...

406
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,900
We followed Koichi because
he was heading in the

407
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,520
opposite direction of the school,
but what the heck is he doing?

408
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,050
Whose house is that?

409
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,870
I have my doubts, but it's
not some chick, is it?

410
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,170
Rohan-sensei...

411
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,130
He's working so frantically.

412
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,580
But I wonder what it is...

413
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,350
I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

414
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,070
What is it?

415
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,030
I'm glad you came.

416
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,760
I've been waiting for you.
You're right on time.
