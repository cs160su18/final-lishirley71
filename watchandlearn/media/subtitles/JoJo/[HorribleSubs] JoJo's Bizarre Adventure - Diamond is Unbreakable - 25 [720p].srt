00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,370
I met that boring man

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,170
when I was going to community college.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,780
He went to a pretty upper-rank
college in the area,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,580
and my friends were envious
because he was quiet and cool,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,200
so I went out with him to feel superior.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,590
We had a child.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,790
I see. Because it's three times the
speed, the picture quality's...

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,310
Hey, Hayato. No "hello" for your mother?

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,760
Hi.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,000
My husband's not a bad man.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,490
It's not as if he drinks a lot,

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,210
and even though he doesn't earn much,

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,520
he always goes to work.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,580
Kosaku Kawajiri
Shinobu
Hayato

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,870
But...

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,250
I'm a woman who married
without ever knowing love.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,610
Hmph. He's home.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,710
He only knows the words
"food," "bath," and "sleep."

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,450
That boring man...

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,250
I'm home.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,550
Where's dinner?

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,800
Oh, you're home? I didn't even notice.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,240
I was really busy today,
so that's all there is.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
But it's your favorite, isn't it?

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,990
Ramen
Land

27
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,660
Is he mad?

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,540
If you have the guts to
get mad, then get mad.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,250
I'm sure you're just going to eat your
dinner silently as usual, though.

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,640
Good evening! This is Morioh Radio,

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,770
brought to you again today by
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,810
What are you doing?

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,810
How's your evening going so far?

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,980
Here's a perfect song to end the day...

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,140
Episode 25     Heart Father

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,470
Fifteen minutes by car from Morioh Station...

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,030
His house was in the villa and resort area.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,030
Morioh Station

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,030
Yoshikage Kira's House

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,440
Rather, it was Yoshikage Kira's house
when that was still who he was.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,450
Kira

42
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,160
He has now gained a new face,
family registry, job,

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,230
and a different place to call home.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm sure he'll never try
to come near here again.

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,750
There aren't any corpses
in the fridge, are there?

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,750
But we had to search the place.

47
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,590
Because now that he's someone else,

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,010
the only clues we could possibly
find on him would be in this house.

49
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,420
Is that his album?

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
That totally looks like him.

51
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,570
Third Grade Summer
Summer Camp
7-25-1974

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,570
Yoshikage Kira...

53
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,760
Born in Morioh Town on January 30th, 1966.

54
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,530
His height is 175 centimeters,
weight is 65 kilograms,

55
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,330
and his blood type is A.

56
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,580
He was born to parents of advanced age.

57
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,310
His father, Yoshihiro, died of
illness when Yoshikage was 21,

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,050
and his mother died of old age not long after.

59
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,330
In 1988, he graduated from
D Academy's Department of Literature.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,100
That same year, he started working for
S City's Kame Yu department store.

61
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,680
He transferred to the Morioh branch in 1993.

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,610
No previous criminal record. No record
of getting married. No close friends.

63
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,310
No girlfriend. No surgeries.

64
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,240
It's impossible to find him using
fingerprints, teeth, or surgery scars.

65
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,310
That's all rather vague information.

66
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,990
Look. These trophies and awards...

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,410
High School Music Recital
Violin
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

68
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,270
They're all third place.

69
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,120
Middle School Track Meet
200 Meter Hurdles
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

70
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,620
He definitely wasn't the school hero.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,620
Award
Grade School
Writing Contest
Overall 3rd Place

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,720
And it's hard to tell what he was good at.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,130
Sports? Music? Writing?

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,570
Even in this photo, he's positioned
so he doesn't stand out.

75
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,380
No one envied him or ridiculed him...

76
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,140
He's a man who doesn't show his
strengths or weaknesses to anyone.

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,180
Which means...

78
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,810
Of course, all this was deliberate.

79
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,350
He was hiding his high intellect and abilities.

80
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,460
He knew that was the best
way to stay out of trouble.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,070
I came here hoping we could possibly
find one of his hobbies, but...

82
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,960
Hobbies? Come to think of it,

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,730
he seems to have kept several jars in a drawer.

84
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,620
See?

85
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,170
It looks like some sort of scrapings in them.

86
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,880
And what are these numbers?

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,880
"1983"... Maybe it's the year.

88
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,350
They have a faint smell.
What do you think they are?

89
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,100
They appear to be nail clippings.

90
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,090
Huh?

91
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,320
Wh-Whose nails are they?!

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,810
Th-They couldn't be...

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,040
No, they're his own nails.
They're not from his victims.

94
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,150
He's kept very meticulous data in his notebook.

95
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,820
Data? You mean the numbers on the jars?

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,370
Does that mean he's been
collecting them since 1983?

97
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,200
For the last fifteen years?

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,750
Thumb | Index Finger | Middle Finger | Ring Finger | Pinky

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,300
Gah! He recorded every
finger! He's so detailed!

100
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:21,130
[Years that my nails grew more than 30cm]
Right Hand Measurements

101
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,100
Does this mean that in 1983, his thumbnail on

102
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,130
his right hand grew 31.5 centimeters?

103
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,980
1983 was the year Reimi Sugimoto was killed.

104
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,340
The records begin in that year.

105
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,980
He probably reached the point

106
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,850
where he couldn't contain his
murderous instincts any longer.

107
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,930
Whoa! He's got his toenail
lengths on the next page!

108
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,580
I guess we've discovered the odd hobby

109
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,190
of a man who tried to convince
others that he was boring.

110
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,010
Look.

111
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,610
Years that my nails grow more than 30 cm
I'm on a roll!!
No one can stop me.

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,030
This data is fortune-telling.

113
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,610
Jewish merchants observe
the movement of sunspots

114
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,270
to determine how well
their businesses would do.

115
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,150
It appears Yoshikage Kira
used the length of his nails

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,400
to determine the condition he was in...

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,570
Whether he was in condition to kill, of course.

118
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,620
1999!

119
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,890
As of June, they've already grown
more than 20 centimeters this year!

120
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,140
He's insane, that sick bastard!

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,210
But this isn't a clue we can use to track him.

122
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,970
There might be something else.

123
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,900
Does this mean someone
else is in this house?

124
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,530
It would appear so.
Josuke, stay on your toes.

125
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,240
Does that mean he's working
with someone else?

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,390
No... That's not possible.

127
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,090
Crimes can be traced from
interactions with others.

128
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,960
A partner could possibly rat him out.

129
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,590
He's not the type to trust anyone.

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,420
This is...

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,510
Jotaro, look at that camera.

132
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,300
I-It's his father... Kira's father!

133
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,810
He's in the picture, right behind us!

134
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,810
But...

135
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,400
This is not good. This is so not good.

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,690
Does that mean he's a ghost?

137
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,910
Yeah. Considering the case of Reimi Sugimoto,

138
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,960
it's possible that his father
also couldn't pass on

139
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,360
to the next world and is stuck
here as a soul's energy.

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,910
Look at his expression.

141
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,250
He looks like he wants us to get the hell out.

142
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,910
Number Withheld   Public

143
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,470
Are you trying to scare us
with your ghost energy?

144
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,440
But this is all the more reason we can't leave.

145
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,010
Hurry up and answer the phone, you slowpoke!

146
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm making it ring!

147
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,110
You think I look like I want you to leave?

148
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,850
It's the opposite, you moron!

149
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,330
My face is saying that I'm never
letting you leave this house!

150
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,620
Anyone who goes after my son must die.

151
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,160
You bastard! You know
about your son's crimes?

152
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,660
Hey, is something wrong?
What's all the racket?

153
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,230
Where are you hiding?

154
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,450
Get out here, you geezer ghost!

155
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,840
Ghost?!

156
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,210
Josuke, he's not hiding.

157
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,010
Huh?

158
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,440
It appears Kira's father has
been present from the start.

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,510
Look.

160
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,100
Boom

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,270
Wha... When did he...

162
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,600
He's moving around in the picture.

163
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,440
He's calling us from inside the picture.

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,590
He probably threw the receiver
from within this picture, too.

165
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,410
I'll kill you...

166
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,800
I'll kill anyone who goes
after my precious son!

167
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,060
Josuke!

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,150
We can attack ghosts with our Stands!

169
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,800
Rohan-sensei used his Heaven's Door
to read Reimi's memories!

170
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,430
Bastard!

171
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,760
Take this!

172
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,930
What?!

173
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,060
D-Damn!

174
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Any damage to the photograph
will come back to us!

175
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,400
Hurry up and fix it, Josuke!

176
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,190
We're going to blow to pieces!

177
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,010
Josuke! Jotaro!

178
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,060
That power... I see!

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,870
You two have

180
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,790
the same kind of power that my son has!

181
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,270
Okuyasu, you're up!

182
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Use The Hand to cut just
the old man out of the picture!

183
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,020
Gotcha! Leave it to me, Josuke!

184
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,680
Huh?

185
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,190
O-Okuyasu?

186
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,660
Wh-What the?!

187
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,610
Why did I run straight into the window?

188
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,490
M-My hands are coming out
all the way over there!

189
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,410
I can't come past this point!

190
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,710
That's...

191
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,720
A-A wall!

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,730
There's a wall here that we can't see!

193
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,210
It won't break! I-It can't be!

194
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,640
You finally figured it out?

195
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,430
That's the frame of the photo!

196
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,220
It may look like you're in the
room, but you're actually not.

197
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,730
I'm a ghost that lives within a photograph...

198
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,790
I can control the dimension of
any photograph that I appear in.

199
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,310
Because I can trap the energy of others'
souls in photos, using the camera!

200
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,440
That is my power!

201
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
That room is inside the picture!

202
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,210
If you damage the photo,
your soul's energy will be hurt,

203
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,790
and the damage will come
back to you, as well!

204
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,340
Inside the picture?
But it's right in front of me!

205
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,050
If you're as dumb as you look,
you don't need to think about it too hard.

206
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,520
After I kill these two, I'll trap
the two of you and slice you up!

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,910
J-Josuke! Jotaro!

208
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,310
I'll kill you...

209
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,000
You bastard! Stop, damn it!

210
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,940
Jotaro, what are you doing?

211
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,770
Do something with your
invincible Star Platinum!

212
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,080
Josuke... I'm giving up.

213
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,830
Huh?

214
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,300
It appears impossible to stop
the old geezer's attacks.

215
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,800
If all the damage is just
going to come back to us,

216
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,220
then even if I stop time with Star Platinum,
we won't be able to do anything.

217
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,220
When something's useless, I give up.

218
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,430
What did you say, Jotaro?

219
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,010
What the hell are you talking about?!

220
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,710
I'll kill you!

221
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,870
Your heads went flying!

222
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,160
A-A knife...

223
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,120
What?!

224
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,120
I can't touch it! J-Jotaro!

225
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,180
I've given up on stopping the geezer,

226
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,680
but...

227
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,960
Wha?

228
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,490
If he controls any photograph he's in,

229
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,640
then maybe all we have to do is take a
picture of him by himself, so he's alone.

230
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,230
What?!

231
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,970
To think you've evaded my attack... Damn it!

232
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,190
Josuke, say something to him.

233
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,220
Something cool. Let him have it!

234
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,390
Y-You didn't scare me at all, you idiot!

235
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,630
The

236
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:57,830
The Ha

237
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,000
The Han

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
The Hand

239
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:58,670
Oku

240
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:58,790
Okuyasu

241
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,920
Okuyasu Niji

242
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Okuyasu Nijimura

243
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,380
Damn you!

244
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,950
You guys are clearly used to fighting.

245
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,760
You must have fought against
people with the same kind

246
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,460
of power as my son many, many times!

247
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,310
He can get out, since he's a ghost.

248
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,350
We need to make sure you
stay in there and keep quiet.

249
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,340
There's something in this house that will
cause him a lot of trouble if we find it.

250
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,630
That's why you attacked us.

251
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,350
I get it.

252
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,690
So if you fold him in half, there's no exit.

253
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,640
He can't run away.

254
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,900
Okuyasu, Koichi, you two search this room.

255
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,680
We'll search the right side.

256
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,950
I can't protect my son now! Damn it!

257
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,320
If that falls into their hands...

258
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,950
Still, what thing that might cause
trouble for him should we look for?

259
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm not thinking too much about it.

260
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,570
If Kira's old man there turns pale,
it's a good sign.

261
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,000
I-I can't breathe...

262
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,590
I-It's too cramped...
Please, just a little is fine.

263
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,200
Just open the tiniest of holes
in the tape and let me breathe...

264
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,930
Y-You really can't breathe?

265
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,040
Hey, Koichi, he's just acting.

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,310
He's trying to get you to
open a hole so he can escape.

267
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,660
Y-You may not believe me,
b-but I really can't breathe!

268
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm claustrophobic, so I
understand how that feels...

269
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,780
Oh, quit whining. You want us
to open up a hole that bad?

270
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,290
Fine, then. I'll open up plenty for you...

271
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,870
With tacks, that is.

272
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,540
Wh-What are you doing?!

273
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,650
Damn it! Let me out of here,
you stupid little brat!

274
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,310
Now you've shown your true colors.

275
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
I won't be removing those tacks.

276
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,970
Tacks? I can't see, but I appear
to be on the post right now.

277
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,760
I've got a great idea!

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,150
Your tacks helped me come up with
a trump card to get out of here!

279
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,280
It's easy! It's all thanks to you!

280
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,830
Well, see ya!

281
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,200
Wha...

282
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,240
Hey, you bastard...

283
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,680
What was that sound? What did you do?

284
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,500
Say something, damn it!

285
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,250
O-Okuyasu, this isn't good!
I think he might have run away!

286
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,150
Jotaro! H-He got away!

287
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,340
I-It's my fault. H-He used
the tacks and did something!

288
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,980
You've been fooled, you moron!

289
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,150
Looks like I've won the battle of wits.

290
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,860
What?!

291
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,420
Th-This is...

292
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,340
What's this doing here?

293
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,550
It can't be!

294
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,120
It's the bow and arrow...
But we retrieved them...

295
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,240
The bow and arrow should be in safekeeping
at the Speedwagon Foundation...

296
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,840
Is there another set?

297
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,100
Josuke, be careful! Kira's father escaped!

298
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,390
What?!

299
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,620
This arrow drew Deadly Queen out of Yoshikage!

300
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,010
The arrow is the important part!

301
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,230
I'll never let you have it!

302
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,120
R-Reverb, Koichi! Use Act 1 to go after it!

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,450
I-It's too far away!

304
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,050
Seriously?

305
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,460
The thing that Kira's father didn't want
us to find was the bow and arrow!

306
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,910
D-Damn it! It's all my fault!

307
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,170
No, Okuyasu. He was just a stronger opponent.

308
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,970
You can tell that Kira is definitely his son.

309
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,550
We've lost to that family's determination

310
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,530
to never give up, and to survive, no matter what.

311
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,470
As long as they don't get
this arrow, that's good enough.

312
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,990
I'm going to use this to
make more enemies for you!

313
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,280
The bow and arrow, huh... I see.

314
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,990
I thought there might be more than one set.

315
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,570
Now I know exactly how DIO and the others

316
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,570
were able to gather so many Stand
users in such a short amount of time.

317
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,400
They created more of them around the world

318
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,760
with a number of those bows and arrows.

319
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,130
I'm assuming Kira's father got this set
from an old woman named Enyaba,

320
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,470
and eventually, Okuyasu's brother, Keicho,

321
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,360
also got hold of one, and came to this town.

322
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,740
Because Stand users attract
other Stand users, apparently.

323
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,740
Yoshikage, where are you right now?

324
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,780
You never could help but kill women,
even when you were a boy.

325
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,120
But if that's what brings you
happiness, I'll protect you.

326
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,370
Because...

327
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,620
You're my one and only son.

328
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,090
Kosaku Kawajiri
Shinobu
Hayato

329
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,600
What's gotten into you?
You're actually cooking?

330
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,740
I-I mean, I didn't know you even knew how.

331
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,850
Two plates? This one's for me?

332
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,110
You're telling me to eat your cooking?

333
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,710
How stupid are you?

334
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,780
Hey! Cut your nails later!

335
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,620
And didn't you cut them last night?

336
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,540
They must grow fast...

337
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,260
Oh... Th-This is actually really good...

338
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,350
H

339
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,430
He

340
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,560
Hea

341
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,640
Hear

342
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:25,680
Heart

343
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:25,850
Heart F

344
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:25,930
Heart Fa

345
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:25,970
Heart Fat

346
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,060
Heart Fath

347
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,140
Heart Fathe

348
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,020
Heart Father

349
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,760
Yoshi

350
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:26,850
Yoshihiro

351
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:26,970
Yoshihiro Ki

352
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,020
Yoshihiro Kira

353
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,260
Kitty!

354
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,710
Why?

355
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,280
Were you crying all night at the top of
that tree because you couldn't get in?

356
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,490
Hey! What gives you the right to
shut the window near the tree?!

357
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,500
I've told you day after day not to shut it!

358
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,380
What's wrong, kitty?
Why are you so worked up?

359
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,140
Cats hate water.

360
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,730
I'm sorry about that.
I shut the window without thinking.

361
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,720
I won't do it again.

362
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,430
Something's wrong. He's changed somehow.

363
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,090
He started cooking out
of the blue last night,

364
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,110
and he's using an actual blade rather
than an electric razor to shave.

365
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,240
Blades always give him razor burn...

366
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,910
Hey, you haven't paid your
rent from last month.

367
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,280
It's now 260,000 yen including this month's.

368
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,750
Pay up right now!

369
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,970
Rent?

370
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,990
You heard him. Hurry up and
bring it from the safe.

371
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,790
Safe?

372
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,350
Hurry! You're the only one who
knows the combination to the safe!

373
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,360
Hey, what are you...

374
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,520
Thank you for coming so
early in the morning, sir.

375
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,490
But I seem to be a bit
short on cash right now.

376
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,990
Huh?

377
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,850
Quit screwing around!

378
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,610
You got in over your head when

379
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,090
you tried to rent my wonderful house
with your lousy income, you peon!

380
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,510
You need to learn to live within your means!

381
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,880
Um, we'll get it right away—

382
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,280
No. Please don't get the wrong idea.

383
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,890
When I said I was a bit short, look.

384
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,390
I meant that I only had a
little over 500,000 yen.

385
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,380
I'll only be able to pay for this month,

386
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,490
last month, and the next
two months in advance.

387
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,230
Will that suffice?

388
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,740
Y-Yes, that's plenty.

389
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,050
Thank you very much.

390
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,640
Pleasure doing business with you!

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,740
Y-You...

392
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,550
You must have stolen that
money from the landlord.

393
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,910
I don't know how you did it,

394
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,460
but you stole it from his bag, didn't you?

395
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,340
I'm sure in most cases,

396
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,510
people would fear him and
think that he's just a low-life...

397
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,730
But my husband's actions...
him stealing that...

398
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,980
For the first time,
after years of living with him,

399
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,570
I think he's so romantic...
