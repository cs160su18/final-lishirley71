2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,620
There it is... The old man's ship.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,360
Right on time.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,000
It's about twenty minutes away.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,390
I-Is Mr. Joseph Joestar the only passenger?

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,490
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,250
The entire crew is from
the Speedwagon Foundation.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,470
The Stand Chili Pepper can only
move where there's electricity,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,120
but I'm sure he'll do everything possible to get

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,250
over the water and onto the old man's ship.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,420
If he gets there before we do, we lose.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,780
The old man will be killed.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,380
Jotaro!

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,700
We've finished checking the boat.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,260
He's not in the battery.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,680
All clear. We can take off.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,830
Josuke, the only ones going to the
old man's boat are me and Okuyasu.

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,520
Huh?

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,870
You and Koichi will stay behind at the harbor.

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,540
Stay behind?! Josuke and me?

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,740
Why?

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,690
Josuke, Chili Pepper's user is hiding
somewhere in this harbor, watching us.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,150
He's waiting for us to make our move,

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,240
so he can confirm the boat's position.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,670
But my guess is that he won't be using a boat.

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,510
All he needs is something with a battery
that's faster than a motorboat.

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,420
Morioh Harbor
Lighthouse

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,010
Just like he did with the bike,

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,430
he'll have Chili Pepper fly over
in something that has a battery.

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,500
Fly? You mean it's actually
going to fly through the air?

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,350
Yeah.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm guessing Chili Pepper is

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,690
stealing a remote control model plane
from the model shop right now.

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,240
A remote control model plane?!

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
That could work!

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
Even model planes can travel over 100 kph!

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,240
That's faster than this motorboat.

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,760
And because Chili Pepper is controlling it,

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,340
he can keep going as long as
the battery and fuel last!

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,900
The controller signal's range won't matter!

41
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,180
So Josuke, if you spot something flying,
look for his user here at this harbor.

42
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,350
Koichi's Reverb has a range of 50 meters.

43
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,950
He can help find him.

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,900
If he makes his move before we do,
the old man is finished.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,370
You need to protect your father
from on-shore. Got it, Josuke?

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,240
Yeah, I get it. We don't have
even a second to spare.

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,460
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,460
Diamond is Unbreakable

49
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,260
Episode 12  Chili Pepper, Part 2

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,010
Do your best, Okuyasu.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,780
Thanks, Koichi.

52
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,420
We'll arrive at Morioh Port in about
twenty minutes, Mr. Joestar.

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,520
I see. Um...

54
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,540
Do you know where my cane is?

55
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,860
Huh? It's right in front of you.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,280
Ahh...

57
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,040
My father, huh...

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,020
Josuke? Is something the matter?

59
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,250
Being told that some guy I've never
met is my father is just kinda...

60
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,400
You know...

61
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,430
Well, it's different if his life's in danger.

62
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,770
I won't be able to sleep well unless
I do my best to protect him.

63
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,310
Besides, I'm sure my mom
will bawl her eyes out if he dies.

64
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,520
Damn it! It must have been Jotaro.

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,370
If he had you two stay behind to find my user...

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,750
Then he completely saw through my
plan to use a remote control plane!

67
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,670
Chili Pepper!

68
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,130
Yeah!

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,350
Jotaro Kujo is a smart man.

70
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,810
Yeah, he's the one person
I don't want finding me.

71
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,040
This Spitfire remote control plane

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,450
can get to Joseph Joestar
in a mere five minutes.

73
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,860
On the other hand, a motorboat will
take about eight to ten minutes.

74
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,490
Which means if I take care of
you two in about three minutes,

75
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,870
I'll have plenty of time to get past them.

76
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,710
Y-You're Chili Pepper's user?

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,170
The name's Akira Otoishi, nineteen years old.

78
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,040
Oh, and don't mind the guitar.

79
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,060
My dream is to one day
be an ultra super guitarist,

80
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,240
like Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck,
who lives hard and passionately!

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,650
So I keep it with me all the time.

82
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,950
In the near future,
I'm going to take my guitar

83
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,190
and knock out people around the world!

84
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,800
Oh, yeah.

85
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,780
I never even thought that the user
would show himself on his own.

86
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,250
That must mean he's confident that
he can kill both me and Josuke!

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,460
Yeeees

88
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,010
I'll only use my pinky finger
against your Shining Diamond,

89
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,560
just like I did with Okuyasu earlier.

90
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,300
Stay back, Koichi.

91
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,770
Here we go, Josuke Higashikata!

92
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,830
One sec.

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,520
Huh?

94
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,670
If you're going to use only your pinky,

95
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,570
then I'm gonna make some rules, too.

96
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,240
Rules? Don't get cocky!

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,170
Someone like you doesn't need any rules!

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,870
How dare you do that, you bastard?!

99
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,460
Well, you said I didn't need any rules.

100
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,050
Didn't you say something about taking
care of me with just your pinky?

101
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,710
So what are you going to do,

102
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,520
Otoishi, my senpai?

103
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,970
I'm going to kill you.

104
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,670
You already said that earlier!

105
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,030
Stop saying the same thing
over and over, you dumbass!

106
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,710
This agony and pain...

107
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,210
What am I supposed to take it out on?

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
This rage...

109
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,300
Who do I proclaim it to?!

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
He's amazing...

111
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,060
Right-Hand Tapping

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,930
I'm going to kill

113
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,360
your mommas, too!

114
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,870
I was able to fully express my heart!

115
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,070
I was able to express the ultimate rage.

116
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,010
Just try it, Otoishi!

117
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,330
Wh-What? The user just...

118
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,040
I can understand his Stand
moving at amazing speeds,

119
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,060
but the user himself was actually
able to move behind me?

120
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,300
Th-That's not it, Josuke!

121
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,780
I saw what happened from here.

122
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,160
It wasn't Otoishi that moved...

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,430
It was you!

124
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,820
You were moved!

125
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,770
What?

126
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,350
Chili Pepper came out and
turned Shining Diamond

127
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,570
180 degrees at incredible speed!

128
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,020
You're facing the ocean, aren't you?

129
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,610
Chili Pepper came out?

130
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,160
Koichi! I haven't seen Chili Pepper at all!

131
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,720
He's underneath the ground!

132
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,790
See all the drainage grates around you?

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,970
His upper body came up from there just now!

134
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,800
There must be electrical wires
running all over under there!

135
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,220
I'm strong when I reflect on my actions.

136
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,970
Behind you to your right! There it is!

137
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,980
Now it's behind you!

138
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,460
It keeps running back into
the electrical wires!

139
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,350
And at light speed!

140
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,440
Jotaro's the only one who
can keep up, after all!

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,820
You don't have time to dig up the asphalt

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,630
and cut all the wires underground,
Josuke Higashikata.

143
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,880
And the more big holes
you make in the ground...

144
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,630
The more places I can pop up from!

145
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,880
Josuke! To your right!

146
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,870
In front of you!

147
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,500
Behind you!

148
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,880
No, wait! Um...

149
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,080
It's like insanely hard whack-a-mole!

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,940
He's moving too fast for me
to tell where he'll come from!

151
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,780
You should really stop relying on guesswork!

152
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,280
Josuke...

153
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,210
And I still have two minutes left...

154
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,660
That's plenty of time to finish you.

155
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,980
Koichi, watch where Chili Pepper
comes from and tell me.

156
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,510
I can't tell because I'm too close!

157
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,900
I-I can't tell, either!

158
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,940
Every time I think he's out, he goes back in!

159
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,970
Watch carefully, Koichi.

160
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,120
You should be able to tell
what I'm thinking by now.

161
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,500
Huh? What you're thinking?

162
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,660
I-It's all squishy!

163
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,930
The asphalt's been turned into coal tar...

164
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,040
And the grates are covered by
the oil film from the coal tar!

165
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,490
I got it!

166
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,310
When he hit the ground earlier,

167
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,370
he turned the asphalt's base into
something else when he fixed it!

168
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,500
Which means...

169
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,630
Behind you, to your left!

170
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,080
Gurb

171
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,630
Yeah! Bull's eye!

172
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,590
Bull's eye? That's great.

173
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,260
Do I get a prize

174
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,680
if I keep hitting him?

175
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:52,770
Chi

176
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:52,890
Chili

177
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:52,980
Chili Pe

178
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,020
Chili Pep

179
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,980
Chili Pepper

180
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:53,730
Akira

181
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:53,900
Akira Oto

182
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,980
Akira Otoishi

183
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,320
It's the boat! I can see the Traffic!

184
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,180
W-We're almost there!

185
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,530
Don't let your guard down yet.

186
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,070
Huh?

187
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,900
Wh-What the hell is that?

188
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,870
Josuke! Koichi!

189
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,500
I-It's so bright!

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,720
It seems that I wasn't taking you
seriously enough, Josuke Higashikata.

191
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,170
I have to give up these foolish thoughts,

192
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,610
don't you think?

193
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm concentrating all of Morioh's
electricity on my Chili Pepper.

194
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,350
The reason I didn't do so before

195
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,520
is because the electricity of this whole
area, which is my power source,

196
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,700
would be drained to zero for a while!

197
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,960
But I don't care anymore!

198
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,500
After I defeat you two, I just need to
fly over there using the RC plane's battery

199
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,540
and kill Joseph!

200
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,880
I-I can't see!

201
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,320
You bastard...

202
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,140
J-Josuke actually got overpowered!

203
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,400
Josuke!

204
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,030
Do you see?

205
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,260
All of this town's electricity is on my side!

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,590
I'll be sure to tack the
cost of all the electricity

207
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,440
I just used onto your meter.

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,110
This is the end, Josuke!

209
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,340
A t-tire?!

210
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,430
By the time you realize it,
it's probably too late.

211
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,130
You blew up that tire on purpose, didn't you?

212
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,340
So you could fix it and trap my
Stand inside the tire's rubber!

213
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,280
That's right! Tire rubber is an insulator,
so it doesn't conduct electricity!

214
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,530
Chili Pepper won't be
able to use electricity!

215
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,320
Damn it!

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,830
Yes! Now we just have to wait for Jotaro...

217
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,080
Just kidding.

218
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Huh?

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
You were going to insulate
me with tire rubber?

220
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,910
It might have worked if it
were about a meter thick!

221
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,190
Don't make me laugh!

222
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,380
As if this flimsy rubber
could have done anything!

223
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,100
You dumbass!

224
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,370
Bomu

225
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,750
You've lost, Josuke!

226
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,900
Great. You would have been much better off

227
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,320
if you didn't have the power
to break through that tire.

228
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,700
Th-The air from inside the tire!

229
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,300
It was completely full?!

230
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,620
N-Not the ocean! The ocean is very bad!

231
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,630
O-Oh, yeah...

232
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,780
Salt water conducts electricity.

233
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,590
Since the ocean's so vast, the electricity
will spread out in every direction!

234
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm sorry! Please!

235
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,640
Pull me out of here!

236
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,850
You said something about reflecting
on your foolish thoughts,

237
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,330
but it seems that it's your
entire character that's foolish.

238
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,010
I-I'm dispersing...

239
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,370
His Stand's been split up! Which means...

240
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,190
H-He's dead?

241
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,550
Jotaro!

242
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,780
We defeated the user!

243
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,480
We defeated Chili Pepper's user!

244
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,970
Well done. That's a relief.

245
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,850
So this guy is Josuke's dad...

246
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,910
His body's huge, but he's
a rickety-looking geezer.

247
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,280
You there,

248
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,860
what's your name?

249
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,500
I-It's Okuyasu.

250
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,860
Okuyasu?

251
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,090
I'm Josuke's neighbor,
and I'm also a Stand user.

252
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,010
Huh?

253
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,670
A Stand user.

254
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,870
Huh?

255
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,170
A S-t-a-n-d u-s-e-r!

256
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,170
Ah, you can't stand losers?

257
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm a Stand user!

258
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,340
Oh, I see! So you're a Stand user.

259
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,030
Must be rough.

260
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,800
By the way, Osomatsu,

261
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,850
I can't seem to find my cane.
Do you know where it is?

262
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,440
Ah!

263
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,140
Sorry about that. It's right in my hand.

264
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,320
Is this geezer okay?

265
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,780
Mr. Joestar.

266
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,740
I've come to carry your luggage.

267
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,970
By the way, Osomatsu, I have a question.

268
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,790
Has Josuke...

269
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,460
Since I didn't even know he was born and

270
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,100
left him alone these past sixteen years,
has he said anything about me?

271
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,470
I can't say that he's said much about that.

272
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,140
I see. So he hasn't...

273
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,080
Yay! It's finally here!

274
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,970
Look, Josuke!

275
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,470
Yeah, that's good, I guess.

276
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,860
To be honest,

277
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm sort of hoping he just goes back home.

278
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,900
Josuke...

279
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,250
Well, I mean, I'm glad
he wasn't killed by Otoishi,

280
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,230
and things ended happily ever after.

281
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,250
But you know...

282
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,450
I've never even met this guy before.

283
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,760
I can't really see him as my parent.

284
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm sure it's just going to be
awkward for the both of us.

285
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,160
Not that I have a grudge
against him or anything.

286
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,070
But I have to think about
what my mom'll think, too.

287
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,790
Don't you think so, Koichi?

288
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,700
O-Oh, no...

289
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,240
Josuke, there's trouble!

290
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,530
Th-The body!

291
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,670
Jotaro, there's trouble!

292
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,920
Akira Otoishi's body disappeared!

293
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
He's still

294
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,670
alive!

295
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,710
There's trouble! The enemy
has boarded the boat!

296
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,430
It appears that Akira Otoishi was not dead!

297
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,650
Seriously?

298
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,110
Take Mr. Joestar...

299
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,300
Who are you?

300
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,370
Huh? Did you say something?

301
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,220
No, he...

302
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm the one who said it!

303
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,130
He's not a part of the Speedwagon Foundation!

304
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,620
Wha...

305
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,060
What?!

306
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
He's the enemy!

307
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,950
Seriously? You bastard!

308
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,420
Please wait!

309
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,320
I'm the one who told you about the enemy!

310
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,620
Would any enemy actually do that?!

311
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,800
He's the real enemy!

312
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,340
You've got a point.

313
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm the one who pointed out the enemy first!

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,860
He came to tell you that so
you'd let down your guard!

315
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,580
Th-That's also a good point...

316
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,750
Wh-Which one's the enemy?

317
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,000
He is!

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,190
D'oh!

319
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,490
I have to choose again?

320
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,540
Damn it.

321
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,510
This is what I get for relying
on my Big Bro so much...

322
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
Okuyasu's easy to deal with.

323
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,310
Jotaro hasn't seen my face yet.

324
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,580
If I can just kill Joseph...

325
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,130
I'm gonna escape!

326
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,810
I'm gonna get the hell out of here!

327
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,900
Chili Pepper!

328
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,280
Huh? What's that about a chilly pigeon?

329
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,030
Rumble

330
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,370
I'll kill you!

331
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,980
I figured out

332
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,920
who it is!

333
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,800
It's you!

334
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,770
Don't think you can fool
Okuyasu Nijimura twice!

335
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,740
H-How did you figure it out?

336
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,490
You wanna know?

337
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,970
How...

338
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,370
I was gonna punch both of you!
I'm not very smart, you know.

339
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,540
Watch...

340
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,580
your step. You're gonna fall into the ocean.

341
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,950
S-Sorry.

342
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,230
If only I had my cane,
I'd be able to get down myself,

343
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,420
but it broke a moment ago...

344
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,240
G-Guess I don't have a choice.

345
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,380
Hold on to my hand.

346
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,630
I just had a great idea!

347
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,160
Why not have Shining Diamond fix the cane?

348
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,670
Y-You idiot! What are you saying?

349
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,080
You're so stupid, Okuyasu.

350
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,540
Huh? Why?

351
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,980
Things are better if he
doesn't fix it this time.

352
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,920
Huh? Why?

353
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,270
Why is that?

354
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,010
Now if we just

355
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,320
retrieve the bow and arrow, it'll all be over,

356
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,370
including the threat to this town.

357
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,680
