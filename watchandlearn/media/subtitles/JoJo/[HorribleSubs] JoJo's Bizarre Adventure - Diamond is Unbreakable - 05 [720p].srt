2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,310
My plan is already finished.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,730
What?!

4
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,800
Okuyasu's big bro was a pretty great danger.

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,580
Koichi, let's get the heck out of this house.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,340
Huh?

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,950
Wh-What about the bow and
arrow that sh-shot me?

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,490
The bow and arrow?

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,700
Looks like Okuyasu's big
bro hid them somewhere.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,190
Are we going to look for them?

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,270
Y-Yeah...

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,610
You know, I could swear they
mentioned having a dad around.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,400
I took some pretty major damage,
so let's just leave for today.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,320
W-We can't!

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,920
I-I'm alive because you healed
my wounds for me, but...

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,460
If someone else is shot with
that bow and arrow again,

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,750
they might actually die!

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,100
Here in this town!

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,630
S-Stay here. I-I'll go look for them myself!

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,640
N-Not to mention, I don't think
their dad is here right now.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,650
I-If he was, I'm s-sure he would
have shown himself by now.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,580
He's a lot braver than he looks.

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,150
He can be tough when it counts...
Or maybe just reckless.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,540
But right now, we should really
hurry up and get out of this house.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,540
Hey...

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,590
Wh-What? D-Don't try to stop me.

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,710
I won't.

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,230
Let's hurry up, snap that
bow and arrow in half,

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,840
and get the hell outta here together,

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,030
Koichi.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,540
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

32
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,500
Diamond is Unbreakable

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,760
Episode 5  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 3

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,940
They have an attic. Maybe the
bow and arrow are up here.

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,410
Th-There they are!

36
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,600
The bow and arrow!

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,210
They're hanging on the far wall!

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,460
Hey, I think this was a bad idea.
There's something in there.

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,540
Is something chained up in there?

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,110
I-Is it a dog?

41
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,430
Those sounds can't be from a human...

42
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,440
I-It sounds like an animal.

43
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,560
No, I'm scared! What should we do?!

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,100
What should we do?

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,670
It was you who insisted on going!

46
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah, but...

47
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,170
We're just gonna have to do this.

48
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,410
Listen up, Koichi.

49
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,930
You're gonna kick in the door as hard
as you can on the count of three.

50
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,130
We're gonna scare it.

51
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,860
Then, I'm gonna run over and
snap the bow and arrow in half.

52
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,660
Got it?

53
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah.

54
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,230
Here we go.

55
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,300
One...

56
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,610
Two...

57
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,380
Three!

58
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,210
Grab

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,490
What the hell is that?!

60
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,780
Koichi!

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,290
Help!

62
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,320
That hand doesn't belong to a Stand. It's real!

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,040
That's a real body!

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,970
H-Help me!

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,780
Bleh...

66
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,190
I didn't mean to chop it off...

67
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,100
Wh-What the heck is that creature?

68
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,670
I can't believe that thing's
been living near my house...

69
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,070
Bleh...

70
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,620
Looks like you finally saw the
thing you weren't supposed to see.

71
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,980
You bastard...

72
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,330
That thing right there... is our dad.

73
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,090
My dad needs these.

74
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,090
Th-The bow and arrow...

75
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,640
I want to find a Stand user for my dad's sake.

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,190
That's why I can't let anyone else

77
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,530
have this bow and arrow or destroy them,

78
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,500
no matter what!

79
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,260
Is it some kind of disease?

80
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,240
Disease? No.

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,270
My dad's perfectly healthy,

82
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,510
and he's got an appetite.

83
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,010
But he just keeps moaning, and he
doesn't recognize me as his son.

84
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,060
So you were looking for a
Stand user to fix your dad.

85
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,400
Fix?

86
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,150
You gonna fix him for me?
That's not it, either.

87
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,620
It's the opposite.

88
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,830
I'm looking for a Stand user who'll kill my dad.

89
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,900
Dad won't die, no matter what.

90
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,060
Whether you smash his head in,

91
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,840
or grind up his body, or rip
things off, nothing works!

92
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,900
I just want to let him die normally.

93
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,150
I swore when I was a kid that I'd do
anything to make that happen.

94
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,350
And to do that, I need this bow and arrow.

95
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,360
Otherwise, my dad will probably
live like this forever.

96
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,190
Because my dad had some
guy named Dio's cells

97
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,790
implanted in his head,
so he ended up like this!

98
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,740
Dio? Did you just say Dio?

99
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,080
That's the guy Jotaro talked about.

100
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,520
Let me tell you a bit about the past,

101
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,680
Josuke Higashikata.

102
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,310
After all, you're not completely uninvolved.

103
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,570
Everything happened eleven
years ago, in 1988.

104
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,070
At the time, I was seven,
and Okuyasu was four.

105
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,250
We lived in Tokyo.

106
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,210
The world was carefree,
thanks to the bubble economy,

107
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,600
but at the time, my dad had no luck.

108
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,280
Our mom died of an illness,

109
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,620
the business that my dad
was running went under,

110
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,120
Luxury Houses
Nijimura Land

111
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,910
and he was in massive debt.

112
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,380
He would hit us for no reason all the time.

113
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,010
Our dad was a total loser.

114
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,930
But then, suddenly,

115
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,310
money started rolling in to my dad.

116
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,490
Even jewels and precious
metals, too, sometimes.

117
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,030
He wasn't even really working.

118
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,420
I found out later when I did some research

119
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,420
that my dad had apparently
already sold his soul to Dio.

120
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,720
He became one of his minions
in exchange for money.

121
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,730
It seems that Dio was looking for anyone
with Stand potential back then.

122
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,160
Somehow, he found out that
my dad had the potential,

123
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,920
though I have no idea now
what his Stand was like.

124
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,780
But one day... Even though it was ten
years ago, I still remember it vividly.

125
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,740
When I got home from school, around 2:00 PM...

126
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,130
Okuyasu!

127
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,470
Did Dad hit you again? That scum!

128
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,160
N-No!

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,250
Huh?

130
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,280
Dio...

131
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,880
Dio's dead...

132
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,660
That has to be why!

133
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,800
Dad?

134
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,570
Dad, let's call an ambulance.

135
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,640
It's no use! This isn't an illness!

136
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,140
The flesh bud has gone berserk!

137
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm done for!

138
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,680
Dad!

139
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,250
About a year after that, he became
a glob of flesh that can't even tell

140
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,450
that we're his sons anymore.

141
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,920
Dio would implant his own cells into
the heads of those he couldn't trust,

142
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,250
and order them around when
he wanted to control them.

143
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,140
Dad had one of those flesh buds
implanted in his head.

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,140
I spent ten years researching everything.

145
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,280
About Stands, about Jotaro...

146
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,560
Then I found out about the
old woman named Enyaba,

147
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,230
and obtained the bow and arrow.

148
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,050
But as I learned all of this,

149
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,190
I also had to accept that
my dad would never recover.

150
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,950
Because Dio's immortal cells
had become one with him.

151
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,990
This is all he does, all day long.

152
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,870
Every single day...

153
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,560
Day after day, for ten years,

154
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,460
he uselessly scratches
around that box of junk.

155
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,960
If I take the box away from him,
he just cries for days.

156
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,640
It pisses me off.

157
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,510
Watching him just makes me
hate the idea of living.

158
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,000
How many times have I told
you not to make a mess?

159
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,160
He can be obedient if I discipline him,

160
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,350
but he never stops digging
around in that box!

161
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,120
Bleh...

162
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,100
Hey! You're the one who needs to stop!

163
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
He's your dad!

164
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,900
Yeah, that's right.

165
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
He's my father by blood.

166
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,220
But right now, he's as much
my father as he's not.

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,610
He's a man who sold his soul to Dio,
and got what he deserved.

168
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,720
Yet, on the other hand,

169
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,410
do you know how it feels, not being able
to finish him off because he's your dad?

170
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,030
That's exactly why I want him to die normally.

171
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,710
Once he's finally dead,
my life can actually begin!

172
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,150
Damn it! I told you to stop that!

173
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,820
It pisses me off!

174
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,450
Hey!

175
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,670
That's enough!

176
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,970
I can't let you have this bow and arrow.

177
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,550
No matter what!

178
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,360
Don't get the wrong idea!

179
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,390
I'll worry about the bow and arrow later.

180
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,270
Right now, that box has my attention!

181
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,940
Dogyaa

182
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,690
Do

183
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,690
Th-The box?

184
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,940
gyaa

185
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,850
I saw him grabbing at some paper scraps,

186
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,390
so I was curious about what it was.

187
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,790
I see now.

188
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,460
A family photo...

189
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,170
S-So there was a reason.

190
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
There was a reason for the
behavior he repeated for ten years.

191
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,110
He was looking for the photo
of his sons at the time.

192
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,430
He might not understand
what's going on right now,

193
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,740
but deep down inside,
he still has his memories!

194
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,820
Memories of the past!

195
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,590
The

196
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,800
The Ha

197
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:28,970
The Han

198
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,930
The Hand

199
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:29,630
Oku

200
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:29,760
Okuyasu

201
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:29,890
Okuyasu Niji

202
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,930
Okuyasu Nijimura

203
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,440
Instead of looking for a Stand to kill him,

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,960
if you'll try to find one that can cure him,

205
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,860
I don't mind helping you out.

206
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,080
But hand over that bow and arrow.

207
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,250
I'm gonna snap them in half.

208
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,640
You planning to run?

209
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,930
Big Bro, let's stop this.

210
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,950
Okuyasu!

211
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,640
Come on, let's stop all of this, okay?

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,140
You were still here?

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,650
Dad might get cured, right?

214
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,610
Even if his body doesn't go back to normal,

215
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,800
maybe his mind and his memories
will go back to how he used to be.

216
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,440
Right?

217
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,630
Okuyasu! What do you think you're holding?

218
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,130
Big Bro...

219
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,060
Out of the way, Okuyasu!

220
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,050
I can't turn back anymore,
no matter what happens!

221
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,390
I've already killed so many people in
this city with this bow and arrow!

222
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,240
Besides, I don't even think of you
as my little brother anymore.

223
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,900
Since you're not my little brother,
I can kill you without hesitation!

224
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,020
B-Big Bro...

225
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,040
You guys...

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,980
Do you have any relatives
here besides your dad?

227
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,000
Relatives? There's only the three of us.

228
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,320
Th-That's...

229
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,600
It came out of the electrical outlet...

230
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,390
Okuyasu! Stop spacing out, you dumbass!

231
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,360
Big Bro!

232
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,380
I'm taking this bow and
arrow, Keicho Nijimura!

233
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,040
I, who got shot by this bow and arrow,
and had my Stand ability awakened!

234
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,610
You think...

235
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,080
someone like you can handle
this bow and arrow?

236
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,910
Keicho Nijimura!

237
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,160
You said Stands depend on
one's mentality, didn't you?

238
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,210
Well, I've grown!

239
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,840
How else do you think my Stand,
Chili Pepper, grew this much?

240
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,550
Worse Company!

241
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,050
Shut up!

242
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,890
Th-That's...

243
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,130
Electricity!

244
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,520
Okuyasu's big brother is being
turned into electricity,

245
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,460
along with the bow and arrow!

246
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,560
Big Bro!

247
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,110
Don't touch me!

248
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,890
You'll be dragged in, too!

249
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,700
Big Bro...

250
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,800
D-Damn it! It's taking the bow and arrow!

251
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,720
Okuyasu...

252
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,290
You were always holding me back!

253
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,130
Big Bro!

254
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
Josuke!

255
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,200
I could have sworn I just saw
someone who looked like

256
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,460
the user looking in through that window.

257
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,240
Do you know anything about
that Stand we just saw, Okuyasu?

258
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,240
N-No. My big bro found a lot of
Stand users I didn't know about.

259
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,500
J-Josuke! Th-That's...

260
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,170
Okuyasu...

261
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,240
My big bro... deserved to end up like that.

262
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,860
There's no way he could
have lived a decent life.

263
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,640
That was his fate.

264
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,650
But you know...

265
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,220
In the end, my big bro...

266
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,700
In the very end, my big bro
defended me, didn't he?

267
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,830
Josuke, you saw it, right?

268
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,950
Yeah. I definitely saw it.

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,970
Your big bro defended you.

270
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,230
Is this Jotaro Kujo?

271
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,300
I don't recognize your voice.

272
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
Who are you?

273
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,860
That doesn't matter.

274
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,780
Jotaro Kujo, I'm asking
you to leave Morioh City.

275
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,510
I don't think I'll listen to someone

276
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,280
I don't know suddenly telling me to leave.

277
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,630
Would you leave, no questions asked,
if you were in my shoes?

278
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm the one who has the bow and arrow.

279
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,670
I got it after I killed Keicho Nijimura.

280
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,820
I don't mind killing you either,
Jotaro, but I hear that

281
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,920
you have the ability to stop
time for a second or two.

282
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,460
You sound like a tough opponent,

283
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,420
so I thought I'd give you
a call and warn you first.

284
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,240
Are you also Stand user?

285
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,700
What do you plan to do
with the bow and arrow?

286
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,990
I don't plan on giving you any trouble.

287
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,470
And as long as Josuke Higashikata
doesn't try anything,

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,570
Unavailable Number  Public Phone

289
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,580
I won't do anything to him, either.

290
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,300
I just received this Stand ability.

291
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,260
I just want to have a little fun.

292
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,950
I'm fed up with my annoying life of
entrance exams and getting a job.

293
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,380
Are you a student?

294
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,910
What difference does that make?!

295
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,560
Listen! If you overstay
your welcome in my city,

296
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,730
I'm gonna kill you and Josuke, too! Got it?!

297
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,730
How many other Stand users are in this city?

298
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,730
Good grief...

299
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,010
Keicho Nijimura was buried
in Kunimi Peak Cemetery,

300
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,290
which is west of Morioh City.

301
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,520
The stolen bow and arrow remain missing.

302
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,260
Nijimura Family

303
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,490
Okuyasu Nijimura decided to settle down

304
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,760
with his father in Morioh City for a while.

305
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,410
And...

306
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,300
Josuke, would you get that?

307
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,080
Yes?

308
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,490
Hey, Josuke! Let's go to school.

309
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,820
Huh?

310
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,610
I'll be going to the same school
as you starting today.

311
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,190
Even so, you don't have to come and get me.

312
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,440
We're not in grade school.

313
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,990
Man, I had no idea your house was,
like, right in front of mine!

314
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah, you could call that a shocking truth...

315
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,200
Come on. Let's hurry up and go.

316
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,470
Oh, is that a friend of yours, Josuke?

317
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,290
Hi! I'm Okuyasu Nijimura!

318
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,270
Come on in and have a cup of coffee
while he finishes getting ready.

319
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,970
Really? Thank you very much!

320
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,270
Your mom is totally hot.

321
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,630
Pardon the intrusion!

322
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,950
This is just great... and heavy...

323
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,270

Episode 6
Koichi Hirose  (Reverb)
