00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,120
What was it?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,630
I've had this feeling ever since last night
that I'm supposed to do something...

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,150
Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,990
Huh?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,750
Th-This house...

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,170
Why?

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,640
I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,380
The door's open...

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,050
I'd like to stop by and
thank him for yesterday,

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,850
but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,760
He might still be asleep,
since he's a manga artist.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,700
I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,750
It's a bad idea...

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,410
Rohan-sensei...

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,940
He's working so frantically.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,330
But I wonder what it is...

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,360
I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,850
What is it?

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,690
I'm glad you came.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,960
I've been waiting for you.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,710
You're right on time.

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,710
Huh?

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,340
However, could I ask you
to wait a little while?

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,860
Two more pages, and I'll be done
with the manuscript for next week.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,930
I think I'll be done in about twenty minutes.

27
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,310
Twenty minutes?

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,250
Did he just say he'd finish
two pages in twenty minutes?

29
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,840
Did I hear him wrong?

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
Two totally blank pages of
manuscript in twenty minutes?

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
No way... And he said next week's?

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,830
We only just read this week's manuscript
yesterday, and he'd just finished it.

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,750
What?! You're not going to do pencils first?!

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,770
I-I can't believe it...

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,860
He didn't even draw that
complicated story in pencil first!

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,520
It's getting more and more complete...
And he's even drawing the backgrounds with it!

37
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,170
Wh-What was that just now?!

38
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,620
I couldn't really see it. What did he do?!

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,080
What?! H-He's doing the beta!

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,850
He's flinging ink around like shurikens,

41
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,540
and hitting exactly the right spots
without going out of the lines!

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,230
Th-This technique...

43
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,300
Aren't you supposed to fill in beta
by hand with a brush?!

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,050
Boom

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,560
He's already done with the beta!

46
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,290
It's only been about two minutes
since the page was completely white!

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,560
It's all thanks to you, Koichi.

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,950
The urge to work keeps welling up in me!

49
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,840
I want to draw so bad, I can't help it!

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,220
I just want to keep drawing!

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,240
This is the first time I've been able

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,780
to draw nineteen pages in one night!

53
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,340
I'm drawing a masterpiece right now!

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,790
Your experiences are amazing!

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,290
It's because I'm using your experience
as the source of my story, Koichi!

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,580
Huh?

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,290
What...

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,230
Hurry! I want your next reality!

59
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,840
Let me see your next page!

60
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,330
The more pages I take,
the more weight you'll lose,

61
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,760
but you don't care, right?

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,960
Because you're going to become
a masterpiece and live forever!

63
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,050
Flip

64
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,420
I-I remember now!

65
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,400
Heaven's Door!

66
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,990
Y-You're a Stand user!

67
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,660
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,660
Diamond is Unbreakable

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,340
Diamond is Unbreakable

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,340
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,670
Hey, now...

72
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,350
Episode 15  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2

73
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,360
I've managed to make a book

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,050
from a single panel rather
than an entire work!

75
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,360
This is amazing!

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,420
I'm growing as a manga
artist and as a Stand user!

77
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,410
I'm going read this now, Koichi.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,510
Oh, my...

79
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,260
Those faces belong to Shining
Diamond's Josuke Higashikata

80
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,220
and The Hand's Okuyasu Nijimura.

81
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,380
How curious.

82
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,600
Why would those two be at my house?

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,070
There's no way Koichi would
tell those two about me.

84
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,140
How strange...

85
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,650
Huh?

86
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,810
I-It's Josuke and Okuyasu!

87
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm not sure how they found
out I was here, but...

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,290
N-Now they can save me somehow!

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,530
Somehow...

90
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,250
I have to get them to save me!

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,590
Huh? Okuyasu and Josuke?

92
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,200
How did you know I was here?

93
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,390
Now, then...

94
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,040
Right now, I don't have any
interest in Josuke and Okuyasu.

95
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,820
I'm just going to finish up the
last two pages for next week,

96
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,230
and steal even more material from Koichi!

97
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,940
I'm so excited!

98
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,340
Huh? You were watching a
manga artist do his work?

99
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,450
This is where that manga artist works?

100
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,930
Rohan Kishibe?

101
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,500
Is he famous or something?

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,790
Have you heard of him, Josuke?

103
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,420
Nah. Even that bastard Hazamada

104
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,310
made fun of me for not
knowing what Perman was.

105
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,930
That wasn't it.

106
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,570
That wasn't what I wanted
to say to them just now.

107
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,510
But what was it?

108
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, we were following you
because we were worried

109
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,280
since you were just wandering around,

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,190
but if nothing's wrong, then good. I'm relieved.

111
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,390
Thanks.

112
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,760
Do you want to come inside
and watch with me?

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
Nah, I'll pass.

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,580
I'd get nervous around somebody famous.

115
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,800
Same here.

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,260
I'm just satisfied knowing that you

117
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,200
didn't come here to meet some chick.

118
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,030
See ya, Koichi.

119
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,850
Okay.

120
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,180
I know I'm forgetting something.

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,210
I know I forgot to tell them
something really important.

122
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
I remember now!

123
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,260
I-I was going to ask for help!

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,500
Josuke! Okuyasu!

125
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,190
I'll head to school soon!

126
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,060
Sure!

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,540
Don't be late.

128
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,730
Got it!

129
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,230
N-No!

130
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,640
That's not what I wanted to say!

131
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,680
I can not attack the manga
artist, Rohan Kishibe

132
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,990
can not

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,450
It's no use! I can't ask them for help.

134
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,320
C-Can there be a Stand as terrifying as this?!

135
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,250
Heaven's Door is way too strong!
There's no way to attack it!

136
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,840
Scribble Scribble Scribble

137
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,200
Ah, I see...

138
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,060
Scribble Scribble Scribble

139
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,620
At this rate, he's going to rip
everything out of me and kill me!

140
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,970
Stop

141
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,810
Someone's coming into this mansion!

142
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,780
What did you do downstairs just now, Koichi?

143
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,590
Huh?

144
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,420
Okuyasu!

145
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,520
Whoa, there! Don't you dare turn around.

146
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,180
Try anything funny, and I'll crush
you with my Stand, you little shit.

147
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,490
Okuyasu!

148
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,210
I don't know how you knew that
I was in danger, but I'm so happy!

149
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,080
It appears he figured it out coincidentally.

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,930
I just realized, but the wound on your hand

151
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,480
must have signaled him
that something was wrong.

152
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,880
It looks like you scratched it or
caught it on something while crawling.

153
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,510
I-I was so absorbed, I didn't even notice...

154
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,220
That's how you figured it out,
right, Okuyasu Nijimura?

155
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,180
Stand name: The Hand...

156
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,550
You have a complex regarding
your dead brother, Keicho,

157
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,740
and whenever you try to make a decision,

158
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,080
you wish that your brother were there.

159
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,980
Wha...

160
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,960
What? Who the hell is this guy?

161
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,590
Hey, Koichi, tell me what
this guy's Stand is!

162
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,460
W-Well...

163
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,580
I-I can't!

164
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,800
I can't say anything that'll put
Rohan Kishibe at a disadvantage.

165
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
If you see even one panel, you lose!

166
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,310
I want to tell you not to look!

167
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,590
Don't look at that manga!

168
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,810
Hey, I told you not to move!

169
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,250
Okuyasu, I wasn't interested in you,

170
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,740
but now that you're in
this house, I have no choice.

171
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,820
I'll have to turn you into material, too.

172
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,290
You bastard!

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,300
What?!

174
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,330
H-He's fast!

175
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,920
Okuyasu!

176
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,020
What the hell is this?!

177
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,550
Josuke Higashikata,

178
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,000
you're there, aren't you?

179
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,650
Ro

180
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:29,850
Rohan

181
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,100
Rohan Kishi

182
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,060
Rohan Kishibe

183
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,690
Hea

184
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:30,730
Heave

185
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:30,810
Heaven

186
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:30,850
Heaven's

187
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:30,980
Heaven's Do

188
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,060
Heaven's Doo

189
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Heaven's Door

190
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,760
Okuyasu!

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,700
What the hell is up with this manga artist?

192
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,960
Oh, shut up.

193
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,110
Now, then... Koichi,
I have a question for you.

194
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,830
Huh?

195
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,210
Why do you think Josuke Higashikata

196
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,330
is hiding behind that door there?

197
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,250
Well? What do you think?

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,880
Why won't he come out, Koichi?

199
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,080
Josuke is hiding so he won't see your manga.

200
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, that is correct. You're pretty smart.

201
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,630
Okuyasu Nijimura there didn't
know about my Heaven's Door,

202
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,430
so I was able to trick him.

203
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,490
But unfortunately, because of that, Josuke
Higashikata now knows who I really am.

204
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,320
On that point, I feel I'm seriously,

205
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,480
no, without a doubt, put at
a very big disadvantage.

206
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,830
There's also another reason that Josuke
Higashikata is hiding behind the door.

207
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,080
What do you think that is?

208
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,630
In order to prevent that from happening,

209
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,630
I have to somehow drag him
out from behind that door.

210
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,350
He's in the middle of trying to figure
out how he's going to kill you!

211
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,850
That's also true.

212
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,640
But it's not the exact answer I'm looking for.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,560
The correct answer is...

214
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,770
Josuke Higashikata is contemplating whether

215
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,820
he should flee this mansion alone or not.

216
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,200
Josuke would never do that!

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,010
Right, Koichi.

218
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,600
It was written in your files that
Josuke Higashikata's personality

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,880
would never allow him to abandon you two.

220
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,610
But you see, manga artists
have a habit of thinking about

221
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,210
every conceivable possibility
because of their job.

222
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,410
Like, what are all of the possible actions

223
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,020
that the protagonist can
take in this situation?

224
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,050
In this case, having Josuke run away
now that he knows who I really am

225
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,100
is truly troublesome to me.

226
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,640
Run... Actually, that might be a good idea.

227
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,310
He'd be able to get Jotaro,

228
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,450
and if Yukako finds out
what's happening to Koichi,

229
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,400
she'll be super pissed off.

230
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,650
Ah! We could win with her hair!

231
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,910
Though I don't want to see her!

232
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,010
Do that, Josuke! Hurry up and let them know!

233
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,200
You fools!

234
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,330
I explained that to you
so that it wouldn't happen!

235
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,890
Okuyasu! I already wrote that into your body!

236
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,920
Huh?

237
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,920
I'll allow you to explain what I wrote
in there to those two, Koichi.

238
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,640
No!

239
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,260
What's written there, Koichi?

240
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,270
B-But that's... No...

241
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,860
We can't run anymore!

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,890
You can't run away from this!

243
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,860
I'm asking you what's written there, Koichi!

244
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,360
If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

245
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,110
If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

246
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,330
S-Suicide?!

247
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,830
You'll commit suicide if
Josuke even tries to help us!

248
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,210
H-Hey, hey! I'll commit
suicide by self-immolation?

249
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,840
Don't be stupid! Like I'd die
in such a horrific way!

250
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
Huh?

251
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,770
But you will! He's invincible!

252
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,130
We can't defy him, no matter what!

253
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,560
Stop! My right hand!

254
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,870
So you've come out.

255
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,770
It's not that he came out,
but he was basically dragged out.

256
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,620
Ah... That's rather childish and simple,
but it might be quite effective.

257
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,510
This room is small and
there's nowhere to run.

258
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,580
If you can defeat me in a single blow,
Heaven's Door will disappear,

259
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,890
and Okuyasu won't commit suicide.

260
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,250
Josuke!

261
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,250
Closing his eyes is pretty simple,
but it might be a good idea.

262
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,130
As long as he doesn't see the manuscript,
Heaven's Door is powerless.

263
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,140
Just come charging straight in like that!

264
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,270
Which means...

265
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,420
I just need to open your eyes somehow.

266
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,340
Oh! He was able to withstand that.

267
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,470
This isn't good...

268
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,950
If he comes charging at me, I'll be finished.

269
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,750
If I were a protagonist in a manga,
what would I do in this situation?

270
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:58,710
seconds

271
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,940
How would I get him to open his eyes?

272
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,460
Go, Josuke!

273
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,840
Hurry up, Josuke!

274
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I know!

275
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,670
There was something written in Koichi's file...

276
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,360
There! This is it!

277
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,950
I'm going to laugh at your hairstyle, Josuke!

278
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,820
That's from, like, twenty or thirty years ago!

279
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,870
You actually think that's cool?

280
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,650
How's that?

281
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
Looks like he gets angry if I say that.

282
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,920
It's sort of hard to believe,
but the file doesn't lie.

283
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,200
It's 100% true.

284
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,010
What did you say just now?

285
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,830
J-Josuke, calm down!

286
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,460
Just try and say that one more time!

287
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,840
You opened them...

288
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,250
Didn't you hear me?

289
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,030
It appears that you think
that hairstyle is cool,

290
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,770
but it doesn't look good on you at all.

291
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,610
It's lame!

292
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:04,280
Though a dirty little bird might
like to make your head its nest.

293
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,480
That's just a maybe, though.

294
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,900
Heaven's Door!

295
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,990
I've won.

296
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,600
Huh?!

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,750
What?!

298
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,560
Wh-What was that?

299
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,560
I-I know that I opened his eyes
and showed him the manuscript!

300
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,530
W-We're back to normal!

301
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm certain that I showed it to him... Why?

302
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,280
Where the hell did you fly off to?!

303
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,740
Come back out here, damn it!

304
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,750
No, he totally didn't see...

305
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,180
He didn't see?

306
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,050
Do you mean that he's so worked up,

307
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,560
he doesn't even know what he's doing?

308
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,500
Where are you hiding, you dumbass?!

309
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,840
Get out here!

310
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,670
Yeah... He's the kind of guy that loses sight

311
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,450
of everything, even that manuscript,
when someone disses his hair.

312
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,930
I had no idea he actually got this mad.

313
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,900
This is way worse than I imagined.

314
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,890
What?

315
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,950
S-Something about Josuke's personality
that Koichi didn't know?

316
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,170
That means it's information
that's not in the file!

317
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,800
Why? Why does he get so
mad about his hairstyle?

318
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,340
There has to be a reason... Why?

319
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,350
I won't forgive anyone who disses my hair!

320
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,430
I won't keep quiet, no matter who it is!

321
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,880
The reason behind his hair...

322
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,020
I think I heard a little about it before.

323
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,610
That just might be why...

324
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,610
Huh? What are you talking about?

325
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,820
It has to do with when
Josuke was a kid, but...

326
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,170
This story is going to include my own

327
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,450
guesses about why this happened.

328
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,040
Apparently, when Josuke was four,

329
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,840
he passed out from an
inexplicable high fever,

330
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,390
and for fifty days, they weren't
sure whether he'd live or die.

331
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,390
Josuke...

332
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,490
He found out later that it
was right around the time

333
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,360
when Jotaro and Mr. Joestar

334
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,660
went to Egypt to defeat the man named DIO.

335
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,360
But at the time, they had
no idea it happened,

336
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,810
so Josuke's mom drove him
to a hospital in S City.

337
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,490
But on that day, Morioh was hit with
its worst blizzard in 18 years.

338
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,910
It's no use... What should I do?

339
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,920
Cars don't come by here often,

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,600
and there are no pay phones.

341
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,200
I should have called an
ambulance at the house.

342
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,820
I shouldn't have brought
Josuke out in this snow.

343
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,960
That's when it happened.

344
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,310
Wh-What do you want? Go away!

345
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,190
That kid is sick, right?
I'll push your car for you.

346
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,450
Huh?

347
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,040
Hurry up and
step on the gas.

348
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,420
Once you get moving,
don't stop. Just keep going...
Or your tires will get stuck in the snow again.

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,110
O-Okay...

350
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,230
Thank you!

351
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,080
His mom looked for that boy later,

352
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,110
but couldn't find a single lead.

353
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,960
Though the boy didn't personally
save Josuke's life,

354
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,350
the four-year-old Josuke
thought that what the boy did

355
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,230
made him his hero.

356
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,530
He's an inspiration that's
burned into his heart,

357
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,330
and his example of how to live.

358
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,840
So when someone insults that,

359
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,560
something deep in his heart snaps.

360
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,040
I don't know who he is,

361
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,060
but I admire him so much
that I copied his hairstyle.

362
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,650
And I won't forgive anyone who insults it,

363
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,630
because it's the same as insulting him.

364
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,690
I think that story might be the reason.

365
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,610
Though I thought Josuke was making it up,

366
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,190
so I wasn't listening very carefully.

367
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,790
Huh... I had no idea something
like that happened.

368
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,630
Rohan's holding a pen!

369
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,060
Bastard! You're going to try again?!

370
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,260
N-No...

371
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,890
I-I wanted to sketch this and write
a memo before I lost consciousness.

372
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:36,210
What a wonderful story! And I just
experienced something amazing.

373
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm so happy.

374
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,580
I don't get to experience
something like this often.

375
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,400
If I can make it work in my own project...

376
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,970
I'm so lucky.

377
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,780
I'm so glad I moved to Morioh.

378
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,260
It's no use.

379
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,650
Until he dies, he'll keep trying
to use anything as material

380
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,830
for his manga, no matter how
horrible the experience.

381
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,610
At this point, you have to commend him.

382
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,670
Putting good and bad aside,
I have to admire that attitude.

383
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,280
He really is a super manga artist.

384
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,300
There you are, manga artist!

385
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,950
I'm not done punching you!

386
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,180
You sort of have to commend him, too.

387
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,810
Y-Yeah...

388
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:25,590
