00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,990
All of Kosaku Kawajiri's shoes
are a bit big for my own feet.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,950
I need to switch them with

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,870
shoes that fit me, before they
start to suspect something.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,520
Hayato.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,800
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,820
Have a good day.

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,510
Darling!

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,520
Something terrifying
happened in the basement!

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,530
It was so scary! I thought I was going to die!

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,300
It might have been scary,

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,520
but it gave me an excuse
to dive into the arms

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,130
of the one I love so much.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,530
Like that, and that, and that!

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,170
You see... There's a cat I've never
seen before in the basement!

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,310
A cat?

17
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 30     Cats Love Yoshikage Kira

20
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,490
So the reason it was really scary...

21
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,350
I went down to the basement

22
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,180
because I ran out of mineral water.

23
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,300
And you know how much I love cats, right?

24
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,180
So I was like, "Oh, it's a British Blue."

25
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,140
It had perfect proportions,

26
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,270
and golden eyes contrasting with
its velvet-like, blue-gray fur.

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,290
Where did you come in from?

28
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,780
You cute little kitty...

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,430
Oh, dear. It's being defensive.

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,080
It must have come in from there.

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,790
But I can't let it stay down here forever.

32
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,550
It might pee on the potato
sack it's sitting on,

33
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,890
and it might even have fleas.

34
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,440
It's okay to get closer if you
don't make eye contact, right?

35
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,600
Oh, right. I just need to let it
know that I'm not its enemy.

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,610
See? My belly's up, which
means I'm being submissive.

37
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,240
Let's be friends.

38
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,900
Why am I trying to humor a cat?

39
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,640
If you don't get out of here,
I'll hit you with this!

40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,500
You hear? I'll throw it!

41
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,420
Darn it!

42
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,930
Why, you!

43
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,310
It was clinging to the ceiling
like some kind of bug!

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,260
A-And what really creeped me out was

45
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,020
that the cat had a hole in its throat.

46
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,740
A hole about as big as a one-yen coin!

47
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,970
And then, from the hole, I heard...

48
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,690
Mreow

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,720
A hole?

50
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,750
Could it be a hole from the arrow?

51
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,960
I just frantically waved
the broom around and ran.

52
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,560
Please, could you go check it out?
It was really creepy.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
It had a hole... right?

54
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,350
Hey... Is it gone? Did it run away?

55
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,300
No... It's dead.

56
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,270
Huh? What are you talking about?

57
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,850
W-Wait...

58
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,520
One of the shards went right into its throat.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,280
Wait a minute! I was just—

60
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,750
It was an accident.

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,660
It's no one's fault. It was just bad luck.

62
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,420
It's not your fault.

63
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,640
It's no one's fault.

64
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,420
Apparently it had a hole in its throat, but...

65
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,020
Now there's no way to tell if
it was a Stand user or not.

66
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,510
No, I'm sure it wasn't...

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,380
Good morning, Morioh.

68
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Isn't it a refreshing morning,
now that the rain's stopped?

69
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,090
I just saw a rainbow in the sky

70
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,390
before I came into the studio.
Is it still out there?

71
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,130
"Where am I, mrowr?

72
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,940
What am I doing here?
Meow, meow," he thought.

73
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,000
"Two days go, someone
attacked me with an arrow,

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,130
and I survived that, but..."

75
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,410
"M-My body's different from usual!

76
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,970
It's shaped funny! It's all wrong!

77
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,720
Why can't I move from here?"
he thought, bewildered.

78
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,480
Where did he bury it?

79
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,460
I'm so sorry, kitty. Please rest in peace.

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,180
"Who's this human lady?

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,720
I get a bad feeling from her," he thought.

82
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,190
"The broom! That's it! Now I remember!

83
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,690
This woman...

84
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,570
That's right! A whole bunch of glass
stabbed me, and I couldn't move!

85
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,800
The reason I'm like this now

86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,070
is because of this woman!"
he thought angrily.

87
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,110
He was perplexed.

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,410
"What? Something came out.

89
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,010
When I got angry at that woman,
something just came out."

90
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,840
My toenail? Wh-Why?!

91
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,600
Is it a curse? C-Could it be that cat?!

92
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,640
He lived by his desire and instinct,

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,330
so he understood this power,
as well as how to use it.

94
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,150
That's... a Stand user!

95
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,110
Why is this thing growing from
where I buried the cat yesterday?

96
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,420
Just what is this thing?

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,870
What did it do to that sparrow?

98
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,050
I couldn't see an actual Stand.

99
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,840
The most important thing is whether
that thing is an enemy or not.

100
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,060
Is it an enemy who wishes
to harm me, or is it...

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,820
I should probably kill it, just in case.

102
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,990
It fell asleep after eating.

103
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,740
Is it a plant or an animal?

104
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,780
It'd be easy to kill it,

105
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,710
but it might be worth
watching for a while.

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,830
The way it turned around because
it thought it was being called

107
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,890
is almost like a cat, as well...

108
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,400
The fact that it can't resist trying
to smell me is also like a cat.

109
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,270
It looks like it might be okay to pet it.

110
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,400
The way it's purring creepily

111
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,380
as it's about to fall asleep
is also, indeed, like a cat.

112
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,410
But I'm still not sure if it has
any hostility toward me or not.

113
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,160
Let's find out.

114
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,850
Hmm... It's angry,

115
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,620
but this confirms that it doesn't
have any hostility toward me.

116
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,160
This is definitely the cat that
I buried here yesterday.

117
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,190
So it really did have a hole
in its throat from the arrow!

118
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,230
D-Darling?

119
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,100
The woman!

120
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,720
That place scares me.

121
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,360
That's where my toenail came off...

122
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,690
This cat attacked her because
it had a grudge against her!

123
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,580
If she found out about this thing...

124
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,650
That rumor might eventually reach
Jotaro Kujo and the others!

125
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,510
That would definitely be bad news!

126
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,110
That's where you buried the cat, right?

127
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,850
It seems like it's cursed,
so I'm really scared...

128
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,690
I didn't bury it here.
Go back into the house.

129
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,970
You're lying!

130
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,650
You're lying out of consideration
for me, aren't you?

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,010
Crap! This cat means me harm, after all!

132
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,760
I still don't know what kind
of Stand ability it has,

133
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,120
but I'm going to get rid of it.

134
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,500
Deadly Queen!

135
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,840
I feel bad for you, but I'm going
to blow you up with this.

136
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,380
First bomb, switch on!

137
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,070
What?!

138
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,560
Impossible! There's no way it can be a dud!

139
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,880
Is it because of this thing?

140
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,550
Is this thing's ability
keeping it from exploding?

141
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,030
Huh? Is that a plant?

142
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,860
Th-That plant is moving!

143
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,730
I told you to go back into the house!

144
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,030
Huh?

145
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,200
Shinobu!

146
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,550
The moment Deadly Queen's bomb moved
away from that thing, it went off!

147
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,710
Could this thing's ability be...

148
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,010
The plant that was a cat
until yesterday thought,

149
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,800
"I'm going to kill that woman!"

150
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,770
I can't allow you to attack her anymore.

151
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,810
I'm going to have to make you disappear.

152
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,310
"Then I'll just have to kill this man
who's getting in my way, too!"

153
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,950
The only time the bomb doesn't explode
is when there's no air around it.

154
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,700
This plant instinctively knew
just how it should kill him.

155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,330
Could its Stand ability be the
ability to control air freely?

156
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,900
It's coming!

157
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,800
I can't see it, but it released something again.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,550
Deadly Queen!

159
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,180
It is releasing something. It's air!

160
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,220
It's releasing bubbles of air!

161
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,540
You damn cat! I'll crush you!

162
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,220
I can't touch it!

163
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,940
It's like I'm stepping on an invisible balloon!

164
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,240
It really is controlling the air.

165
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,610
What?

166
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,580
Th-That thing...

167
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,210
I can't see it, but I'm sure it
released an air bubble again.

168
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,920
This isn't good... Something isn't right!

169
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,710
What?

170
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,550
The cactus!

171
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,470
Sh-Shinobu!

172
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,930
What is this? Was I,
Yoshikage Kira, just relieved

173
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,340
at the fact that the cactus
needles didn't pierce her eyes?

174
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,470
What is this feeling?

175
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,570
Am I actually worried about someone else?

176
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,150
No!

177
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm just worried that if this
woman dies, Jotaro Kujo

178
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,470
will find out about this house!

179
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,420
That's the only reason I was
relieved that she was okay.

180
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,870
That's all it is...

181
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,460
That attack won't work anymore.

182
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,480
Even though I may not be able to see it,

183
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,300
now that I know the mystery behind it...

184
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,890
It's just an ability that allows you
to blow and spread air bubbles.

185
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,460
You are no longer a match for Deadly Queen.

186
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,660
What?!

187
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,540
Th-This thing just...
put an air bubble into my veins!

188
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,450
It's rising higher and higher into my body!

189
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,210
I'm not that knowledgeable
in medicine, but I've heard

190
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,020
that if you inject more than 10cc
of air into a human being's veins,

191
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,260
it can block the vein and lead to death.

192
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,890
This is definitely more than 10cc!

193
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,930
Shit!

194
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,350
It's no use! This is bad...

195
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,480
I have no choice... I have to do it.

196
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,110
Deadly Queen!

197
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,850
I underestimated that thing.

198
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,250
Its ability to freely control the air...

199
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,790
It's a terrifying ability.
Wh-What should I do?

200
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,040
It's coming! It's going to attack again!

201
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,050
What should I do?

202
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,790
That was close...

203
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,630
For now, I guess I'll let this go.

204
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll let this go.

205
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,370
S

206
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,490
St

207
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:36,580
Str

208
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,660
Stra

209
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:36,790
Stray

210
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,870
Stray C

211
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,080
Stray Ca

212
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,000
Stray Cat

213
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:37,660
A

214
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:37,700
A Plant

215
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:37,790
A Plant That

216
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,870
A Plant That
Was

217
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:37,910
A Plant That
Was Once

218
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,990
A Plant That
Was Once a

219
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,000
A Plant That
Was Once a Cat

220
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,960
He told me yesterday that he buried
that cat's corpse far away.

221
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,000
The cat's curse, as he said,

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,700
was just an illusion my mind
came up with out of fear.

223
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,200
I suddenly fainted in front of him...
It was so embarrassing.

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,220
But...

225
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,500
He took care of me, even though
it made him late to work.

226
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,300
I was so happy.

227
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,970
It felt like our hearts were connected.

228
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,200
That was the happiest morning of my life.

229
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,400
Well? Is it good?

230
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,980
That Hayato...

231
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,920
He left without saying goodbye again.

232
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,450
Was that brat observing me?

233
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,350
Oh, darling!

234
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,910
That's my plate.

235
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,800
You don't like shiitake mushrooms,
so I took them out of yours...

236
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,980
When did you start liking them?

237
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,270
You've already eaten more than half of it.

238
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,370
But I'm happy to see you
gobbling down my cooking.

239
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,370
I guess you realized that you only
thought you didn't like them, huh?

240
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,010
Yes.

241
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,870
All right, I'm going.

242
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,210
Have a good day, darling.

243
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,730
Jeez... I wanted him to
give me a goodbye kiss.

244
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,340
But we're understanding
each other's feelings.

245
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,820
I'll seduce him soon enough.

246
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,510
He was using a shoehorn
to put on his shoes.

247
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,370
I'm sure he put on the 25.5cm sized shoes.

248
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,880
Having two different sizes of shoes is weird.

249
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,650
It's also weird that Mom and
Dad are getting along lately.

250
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,950
He was even gobbling up the shiitake
mushrooms that he hates.

251
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,760
This is weird, too.

252
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,430
Why was he writing his own name over and over?

253
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,850
And last night...

254
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,940
No matter how many times
I see it, that's potting soil.

255
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,200
And I think the other thing
he has is a bag of cat food.

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,700
And then he goes inside his closet...

257
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,020
They're all wearing hats.

258
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,110
Do they have to wear those for school?

259
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,000
Something doesn't feel right...

260
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,220
The attic?

261
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,820
Wh-What is that bizarrely shaped thing?

262
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,390
It's too dark for me to see it clearly.

263
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,650
There it is. It's that bag.

264
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
Huh?

265
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,400
Wha—

266
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,210
I-It's moving!

267
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,830
It's not a plant... Those are eyes!

268
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,380
It has eyeballs, and it's looking this way!

269
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,800
Could that cat food be for this thing?

270
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,050
Oh, darling.

271
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,470
What's the matter?

272
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,560
Did you forget something?
Oh, is the thing you forgot

273
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,840
my goodbye kiss?

274
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,750
No...

275
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,280
Aww...

276
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,390
Then what is it? Shall I get it for you?

277
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,900
No, I'll get it.

278
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,030
Why is he back?

279
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,400
Crap!

280
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,740
Huh?!

281
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,300
What?! Th-This thing...

282
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,550
Something I can't see that's inflated,

283
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,420
like some kind of air bubble,
has my arms and neck pinned down!

284
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,970
He's coming up! C-Crap!

285
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,470
The attic! I knew it! That brat...

286
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,520
I-It attacked me when I
tried to shut the window?

287
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,940
Does this thing need sunlight to move?

288
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,640
I-I know! If they're air bubbles...

289
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,830
Yes! So it was the sunlight.

290
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,790
That noise...

291
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,320
Did Stray Cat wear itself out trying to

292
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,500
get the cat food from the shelf using air?

293
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,010
I thought it would stay calm if
there was no sunlight hitting it,

294
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,660
but I guess a tiny bit of light was coming in.

295
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,910
Still...

296
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,280
I thought that maybe Hayato
had gotten in here,

297
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,200
but it appears that it was, thankfully,
just my imagination.

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,880
If that brat knew the truth about me,

299
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,130
I would have had to kill him.

300
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,460
He has Dad's face,
but that's not my dad. Who...

301
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,670
Wh-Who the hell is he?!
