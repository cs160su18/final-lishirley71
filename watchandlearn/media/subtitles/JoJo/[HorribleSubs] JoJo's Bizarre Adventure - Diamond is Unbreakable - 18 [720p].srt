00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,570
Just like a sickness that continues to
progress without any visible symptoms,

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,740
there was someone hiding
in our town of Morioh,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,160
committing murders somewhere in the town.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,770
And it seems like no one's even realized
that these murders are taking place.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,830
It's such shocking and chilling information.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,760
But there is currently no
way of finding that murderer.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,300
We don't even know how many Stand
users currently live in Morioh.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,150
And rather than worry about a huge problem
that presents no visible symptoms,

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,940
people are worried about what
they should have for dinner,

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,610
because that's what's right in front of us.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,360
Kameyu

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Bank No.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Deposit Amount

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Transaction No.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Window No.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Balance

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,690
Branch No.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,070
I only have 285 yen left in my savings!

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,940
But I had 20,000 yen in there!

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,420
Twelve yen?!

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,530
I was weak!

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,940
My 20,000 yen that I was saving up to
buy those kewl brand-name shoes...

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,890
I can't even remember what I used the money on.

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,450
This is all that damn old man's fault!

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,530
Because he used my card to buy
130,000 yen worth of baby crap!

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,530
I made the old man pay me
back the 130,000 later,

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,410
but then I felt like spending a little

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,650
here and there wouldn't hurt,
and totally lost track of my spending.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,410
I wonder if I tucked away a thousand yen
somewhere and just forgot about it.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,170
A cockroach!

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,050
I guess banks could have them, too.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,270
A S-Stand?

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,620
I found one yen.

35
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,110
Y-You bastard!

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,160
I-It's a Stand!

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,140
A new Stand has appeared!

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,680

Episode 18    Shigechi's Harvest, Part 1

43
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,730
Where the hell is it heading?

44
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,020
There's another one!

45
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,290
Damn it! Who the hell are you?!

46
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,210
I'll kill you!

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,460
Okuyasu!

48
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,050
Oh, Josuke!

49
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,600
Look! It's an enemy Stand. I'm gonna kill it!

50
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,970
There're two of them!

51
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,200
Yeah. There was one at the
bank, so I followed it here.

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,480
How did it attack you?

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Actually, it didn't attack me.

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,180
I was buying Calpis Water,

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,350
and it suddenly came out from
under the vending machine.

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,150
What? It didn't attack you?

57
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,780
But you just said you were going to kill it.

58
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,030
It scared the crap out of me,

59
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,700
and I spilled the Calpis Water
all over my uniform.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,920
Damn it! Give me back my money!

61
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,630
Found it!

62
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,710
Hey, another one just joined in...

63
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,080
Found it!

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,290
Found it. Found it.

65
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,600
What the... What the hell are these guys?

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,850
There's a ton of them gathering up!

67
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,250
Okuyasu, they're just like
your brother Keicho's Stand.

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,350
But...

69
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,240
Since they're ignoring us, they're
a totally different kind of creepy.

70
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,610
Yeah...

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,080
Be careful! The user's probably nearby.

72
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,860
Boom

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,810
It's...

74
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,490
It's money!

75
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,850
Come to think of it, it picked up a 1 yen coin

76
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,600
underneath a machine at the bank.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,800
They're only 1 yen and 10 yen
coins, but they're all real!

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,690
Well done, you guys.

79
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,790
Many a little makes a mickle.

80
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,530
I think that's about five thousand yen.

81
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,440
As long as I have you guys, Harvest,

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,580
I'll never have to worry about money.

83
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,240
Hey, that's the user?

84
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,730
He's talking to his Stand...

85
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,100
Yeah... He seems to have
become a Stand user because

86
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,970
of the bow and arrow, but it doesn't
look like he's trying to attack us.

87
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,730
Grin!

88
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,110
You guys...

89
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,940
You can see my Harvest?

90
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,780
Hey, you can see them, right?!

91
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,960
Yeah, it's called a Stand.

92
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm Josuke Higashikata.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,530
This is Okuyasu Nijimura.

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,020
Friends! I've never had any before!

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,780
My name is Shigekiyo Yangu.

96
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm a second-year at Budogaoka Middle School.

97
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,180
I weigh 110 kilograms,

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,440
and my Papa and Mama call me "Shigechi."

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,280
"Shige-chan" turned into "Shigechi."

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,190
My turtle I have at home is named Gonta.

101
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,090
The other day, I was wondering
if the 41 yen, 62 yen,

102
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,420
and 150 yen stamps all tasted different,

103
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,580
so I was licking them all,
and Mama yelled at me.

104
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,410
This is a picture of my Mama,
who yelled at me.

105
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,800
A picture...

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,950
Wow, your mom's actually kinda hot.

107
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,960
How strange.

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,500
U-Um...

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,480
So, you call these things "Harvest"?

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Did they really gather up all this?

111
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,070
Yup. From ditches and underneath
vending machines and things...

112
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,180
But I'm not a thief.

113
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,930
The officer at the police box said that

114
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,150
I didn't have to turn in any
change under a hundred yen.

115
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,690
I hate bad things!

116
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,070
That's not a bad thing at all!

117
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,090
Actually, I think you're doing
something great for society.

118
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,600
Though it's not much,

119
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,370
you're putting all of the forgotten
change back into the Japanese economy.

120
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,210
That's a great thing.

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,770
Really? I'm great?

122
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,510
Hey, do you think I'm a great person?

123
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,480
It's what you'd call a blind spot for ideas.

124
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,930
No one would do all this to get money.

125
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm jealous... You're smart.

126
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,240
D-Did you just call me smart?

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,140
N-No one's ever told me that before.

128
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,730
I've picked up about 120,000 yen, but...

129
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,860
120,000?!

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,860
B-But that makes me even happier!

131
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,940
A t-total of 120,000?!

132
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,210
Aren't I a good boy?

133
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,740
J-Just here in Morioh?

134
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,910
Ayup! I don't go outside of Morioh.

135
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,190
I might get lost and someone might kidnap me.

136
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,120
120,000... And I only have 12 yen.

137
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,780
Okuyasu...

138
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,010
Is something wrong with your left foot?

139
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,530
Whoa, what?!

140
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,800
There are three 50 yen coins on the ground!

141
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Do they belong to you, Shigekiyo?

142
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,510
I didn't even notice...

143
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,110
Talk about stingy...

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,820
Hey, I'll give you guys half of this.

145
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,700
Huh?!

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,830
You're my friends, right?
We have the same kind of power.

147
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,680
R-Really?!

148
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,150
Lucky us!

149
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,610
N-No... Wait a sec.

150
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,880
Look, you shouldn't give other
people money or things so easily.

151
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,400
Then I'll give it to you in a hard way.

152
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,230
I'll give it all to you. We're friends, right?

153
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,900
Hey, why are you just
hardening your expression?

154
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,260
H-Hey...

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,460
Let me talk to him alone for a sec, Shigechi.

156
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,180
Hey, Josuke! Stop acting
like a goody-two-shoes.

157
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,630
If he says he's going to give it to us,
we should just take it, dumbass!

158
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,950
My pride won't let me do that. Not Josuke.

159
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,570
I'll take anything anyone wants to
give me other than a virus! Got it?!

160
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,360
Calm down! I totally understand
what you're saying!

161
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,250
Stop crying!

162
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,980
But...

163
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,730
I'm actually really broke right now, too.

164
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,430
And so I just thought of a nice idea
that can make everyone happy.

165
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,350
Huh? An idea to make everyone happy?

166
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,150
Leave it to me.

167
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,440
Ha

168
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,610
Har

169
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:31,730
Harv

170
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,900
Harve

171
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,060
Harves

172
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,980
Harvest

173
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,690
Shige

174
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:32,770
Shigekiyo

175
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:32,860
Shigekiyo Ya

176
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:32,940
Shigekiyo Yan

177
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,980
Shigekiyo Yangu

178
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,670
To All the Good Kids
Let's All Play Nice
Morioh Town

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,590
Hey, Shigekiyo. Can I call you "Shigechi"?

180
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,820
Sure.

181
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,380
Shigechi, we can't take this.

182
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,420
What you tried to do just now

183
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,550
is the same as trying to
buy friendship with money.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,270
Huh? B-But that's not what I meant!

185
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,830
I believe that friendship is

186
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,820
something that grows between
people through a common bond.

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,300
I was just...

188
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,520
I know. I totally get how you feel.

189
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,510
We're all Stand user buddies.

190
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,890
And so...

191
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,600
Why don't we do a little business
and strike up a friendship?

192
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,450
Business?

193
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,660
Yeah. A business using all three of our powers.

194
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,560
Right here?

195
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
That's your elbow. No, business.

196
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Basically, I think you're at your
limit for picking up lost change.

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,080
So I have an idea for how
we can use your Harvest

198
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,440
to make even more money.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,210
Huh?

200
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,940
An idea that'll make us more money
than Harvest picking up change?

201
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,490
It's not a bad thing, and it
won't cause anyone trouble.

202
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,920
S-So what's the idea?

203
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,550
That's where the business comes in!

204
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,210
Give Okuyasu and me half of
what we make for the idea fee.

205
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,230
You'll take the other half, Shigechi.

206
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,560
The three of us are going to work
together to pull off a huge project,

207
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,910
and we can all become happy.

208
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,070
O-Okay! That's fine, but wh-what should I do?

209
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,250
You know what this is, right?

210
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,350
Kameyu

211
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,370
A b-blue stamp!

212
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,130
Yeah! When you shop at one of Eastern
Japan's biggest department store chains,

213
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,820
Kameyu, you get one sticker
for every 100 yen you spend.

214
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,040
I think there are a lot of people who

215
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
don't collect these and just throw them away.

216
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,380
There are these, too.

217
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,110
A voucher from a stationery shop,
Meiwado, worth 20 yen.

218
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,450
yen

219
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,450
Meiwado Stationery Shop

220
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,450
Product Voucher

221
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,950
Oscar

222
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,050
A coupon from CD Shop Oscar,

223
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,990
where you can trade in ten for
2,000 yen worth of merchandise.

224
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,040
The cleaners, the toy shop Märchen Kids...

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,390
Nagasaki
Cleaners

226
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,390
Yotsuba Electronics

227
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,390
Service Card

228
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,400
And this is a card from
Yotsuba Electronics.

229
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,190
Now, this is the important part.

230
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,280
At Kameyu, for example,
you can get cash back for these.

231
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,350
Ah, a-are you... I got it, Josuke!

232
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,080
I know what you're thinking!

233
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,540
Let's go, you guys!

234
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,920
Rumble

235
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,380
With only one or two,
they'd just be scraps of paper...

236
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,590
But if Harvest happened to pick up

237
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,100
the thousands and ten thousands
that are thrown away around town...

238
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,900
Found it.

239
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,620
Inside this trash can!

240
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,640
Inside that trash can!

241
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,260
Found it. Found it.

242
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,650
Found it.

243
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,130
Found it. Found it. Found it.

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,860
Found it. Found it. Found it.

245
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,870
Th-They just keep piling up one after another!

246
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,040
Wh-What an amazing Stand!
That's awesome, Shigechi!

247
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
I got complimented again.

248
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,290
We'll fix the ripped pieces of
paper with Shining Diamond.

249
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,590
Yes! Do we have tens of thousands now?

250
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,720
No, it's definitely over 100,000 by now.

251
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,030
Yes!

252
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,380
Grab

253
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,600
We're an invincible trio!

254
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,060
Let's go get our money!

255
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,190
But, Josuke, you sure are something.

256
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,890
After you went on about pride and junk...

257
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,400
Well, in this case,
everyone's happy, so it's fine.

258
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,080
F-Friendship is great...

259
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,810
O-Okuyasu, J-Josuke, I wonder if it'll be okay.

260
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,480
Will it turn into money that easily?

261
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,040
Calm down, Shigechi. Believe in Josuke.

262
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,880
That's Okuyasu and...

263
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,970
I wonder who that is.

264
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,350
Okuyasu—

265
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,480
Josuke! H-How did it go?

266
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,190
Were you able to get the money?

267
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,460
Did they tell you to piss off?

268
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,450
I wasn't able to get cash back
at the CD shop or the toy store.

269
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,690
But I can exchange the coupons for about
40,000 yen worth of CDs or video games.

270
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,610
I'm not asking about that!

271
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,160
What about Kameyu?

272
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,810
Were you able to get cash
back for the Kameyu stickers?

273
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,560
Actually, something kind of
unexpected happened.

274
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,000
S-Something unexpected?

275
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,070
It unexpectedly turned into 61,500 yen!

276
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,330
Here you go! It's real, Shigechi!

277
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,690
I-It's real!

278
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,870
It's right in front of my eyes! It's like a dream!

279
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,170
That's awesome, Shigechi!

280
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,510
Your Stand, Harvest, is really amazing!

281
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,850
Y-You really think it's amazing?

282
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,980
Hey... P-People don't really
compliment me much...

283
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,020
Do you really think I'm amazing?

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,780
Hey, have a little more confidence, Shigechi.

285
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,880
This is something that only you can do.

286
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,780
Okuyasu... Josuke...

287
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,190
Straighten.

288
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,500
Hey, girl. I got a fat stack!
Wanna go have some fun?

289
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,990
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

290
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:28,210
Oh, yeah. Here, Josuke, Okuyasu.
Here's your share, 10,000 yen.

291
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,800
Shigechi, what is this?

292
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,640
We've got friendship, right?
We're friends, right?

293
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,310
Yeah, we are.

294
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,380
So that's a token of our friendship.

295
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,330
Hey, wait...

296
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,970
This isn't what we promised, is it?

297
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,870
You said okay to us getting half,
and you getting the other.

298
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,410
Half of 61,500 yen is 30,750 exactly.

299
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,090
R-Really? Did I say that?

300
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,670
What?

301
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,700
N-N-Not to mention...

302
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,460
It w-was my H-Harvest's job
to collect all of those.

303
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,960
I did it all!

304
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,850
Y-You two were just talking and did nothing.

305
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,260
And, if Josuke hadn't come up with the idea,

306
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,570
you never would have thought
of gathering up all those!

307
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,030
I would have eventually thought of it!

308
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,990
I'm an awesome guy!

309
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,410
Er... No, no... You never would have
thought of it with that pea brain of yours!

310
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,290
Hey, stop, Okuyasu.
Come here, fall back a sec.

311
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,370
This is just great.

312
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,580
Apparently he was fine with a few thousand,

313
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,270
but once it went over ten thousand,
he's much more hesitant to pay up.

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,750
I don't think he means anything bad by it,
but since he's got the mind of a kid,

315
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,190
no matter what we say,
he's gonna feel like we tricked him.

316
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,270
We should be the adults here and let it be.

317
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,070
We got 10,000 yen out of it,
so let's call that good.

318
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,430
I guess if you're okay with it, I won't argue...

319
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,440
But this just pisses me off so much!

320
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,610
Are you sure he's not taking advantage of us?

321
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,990
No, Okuyasu, there's no point
in fighting right now.

322
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,570
We just need to teach Shigechi how
adults actually make agreements.

323
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,580
Oh, so you can make more money?

324
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,710
You smug bastard...

325
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,340
But that's what I love about you.

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,080
All right, thanks. We'll gladly take this.

327
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,850
Okuyasu.

328
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,600
Are you thirsty?

329
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,490
Is there anything you want to drink? I'll buy.

330
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,450
You're going to buy it for me?

331
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,360
Then... I want some Calpis Water.

332
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,850
Then drink some.

333
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,020
Ah! Hey! Why are you throwing those away?

334
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,660
They're just worthless junk tickets,
like for the year-end lottery.

335
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,290
I told Shigechi to pick them up along
with everything else earlier.

336
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,220
You mean the losing New Year's Lottery tickets?

337
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,380
How do you know it's a losing ticket?

338
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,380
No one would throw away a
winning ticket, dumbass.

339
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
There are lots of people who forget

340
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,010
to confirm the numbers and
never get their prizes!

341
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,930
If this wins, I'm gonna take half of it.

342
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,960
Promise me, damn it.

343
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,510
Sure. Half is fine.

344
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,480
But if you win a sheet of stamps, I don't want it.

You really like those cheap,
annoying ways of gambling.

347
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,370
Ah, that's no good... How about this one?

348
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,510
I wonder if we're allowed

349
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,360
to claim prizes from the
lottery if we're in high school.

350
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,860
Lottery?

351
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,640
It should be fine as long as you
have your ID and name stamp.

352
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,970
SG Group 121314...

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,990
Nope, this one's not a winner.

357
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,600
I thought there might be a chance, but...

358
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,600
Hm?

359
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,100

SG Group 121314... Um...

362
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,320
Hey, maybe, just maybe, if I won...

363
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,450
Do I have to take it to the police?

364
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,110
You idiot. There's no reason to take it there.

365
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,410
Harvest just picked them up
after people threw them away.

366
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,250
And you should only worry about that
when you're bragging after you win.

367
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,460
Good luck with that.

368
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,170
What? SG Group 121314?!

Prize    5 Million Yen

377
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,270
5 Million Yen

378
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,020
5,000,000!

379
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,270
There's no doubt about it! I won!

380
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,780
What?! You better not be
messing around, damn it!

381
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,660
5 Million Yen

382
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,490
Yes! It's a dream come true! A fantasy!

383
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,290
There's no other experience like this!

384
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

385
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,180
Calm down, Okuyasu.

386
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,800
Let's confirm it one more time.

387
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,060
SG Group 121314, prize 5,000,000 yen.

388
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,240
There's no doubt about it!

389
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,390
It's too good to be true, but it's true!

390
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,810
And it's a lottery ticket
that was thrown away,

391
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,140
so it would've just gone
into the incinerator.

392
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,070
There's still a few days before it expires.

393
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,590
Even if they ask us annoying questions
when we go to cash it at the bank,

394
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,930
we can just proudly say that we bought it!

395
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,720
You got that?

396
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,450
Heck yeah, I do!

397
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,660
Which means it's our 5,000,000 yen!

398
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,220
I wonder what I should buy.

399
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,570
First, I gotta get some kewl Italian shoes!

400
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,330
Then I'll buy a high-end
suit with a sexy silhouette,

401
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,640
and go all-out at Tonio's shop
and eat the most expensive food!

402
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,300
I also want to go overseas somewhere!

403
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm gonna put it in savings!

404
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,230
Man, talk about a boring life!

405
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,100
M-My Harvest is the one that picked that up...

406
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,880
Five million... Th-There's no
way I'm giving up half of it.
