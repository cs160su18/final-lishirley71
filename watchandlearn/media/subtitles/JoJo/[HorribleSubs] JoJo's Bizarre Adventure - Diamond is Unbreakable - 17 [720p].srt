00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,040
You Are Here

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,440
Koichi...

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,860
Over here, Koichi.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,420
Ah! R-Rohan Kishibe!

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,110
Come on, now. You don't have
to put up your guard like that.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,900
It's not like I'm going to harm you.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,890
Besides, when I read you with Heaven's Door,

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,660
I actually felt a lot of admiration for you.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,520
I have a feeling we have a lot in common.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,840
Don't you think so?

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,750
Uh...

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,970
You see, there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,510
I lived around here from when I was
a baby up until I was about four.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,950
I wanted to find the place where
I lived then, for nostalgia's sake.

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,220
It's also a manga artist's job
to remember their childhood.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,300
But the memories would be from
when I was three or four,

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,850
so I don't remember much.

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,530
Oh...

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,640
What I wanted to ask you
about is this town map.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,300
It's quite bizarre.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,540
Tailor
Tanaka

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,540
You Are Here

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,540
Convenience Store
Owson

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,540
Soba Shop
Arisugawa

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,540
Kisara
Drugstore

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,310
Look.

28
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,540
Soba Shop Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore,

29
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,290
and the convenience store Owson is how
the shops line up from the right.

30
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,250
Huh?

31
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,290
Now look at the actual shops.

32
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,050
From the right, it's Soba Shop
Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore, and...

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,970
Owson on the left...

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,420
Huh?

35
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,610
The road between Owson and
the drugstore isn't on the map.

36
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,940
How lazy of them.

37
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,850
Koichi, will you come with me for a bit?

38
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,470
I'd be very grateful if you'd
show me around here.

39
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,980
Huh? Well, I, uh...

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,070
Even after I, Rohan Kishibe,
have asked so courteously?

41
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,940
I see.

42
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,580
So you're not even willing
to walk ten or so meters.

43
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,580
You're so selfish. Jeez...

44
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,380
Just five minutes, okay, Sensei?

45
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,800
Just five minutes!

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,170
Episode 17    Rohan Kishibe's Adventure

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,760
Isn't it bizarre?

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,290
This road isn't on this 1/3000 scale map

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,810
of Morioh published by
National Map Publishers.

50
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,010
Huh? Sometimes if you find errors in maps,

51
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,060
they'll give you a bookstore gift certificate.

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,900
Ugh...

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,080
Jeez, this map is infuriating.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,470
Look, Koichi.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,900
Yonemori

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,910
These houses that say "Yonemori," "Honma,"
and "Onodera" aren't on it, either.

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,900
Honma

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,900
Numakura

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,900
Onodera

60
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,630
This map is filled with errors.

61
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,890
Two or three bookstore
gift certificates won't cover this.

62
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,170
Rohan-sensei..

63
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,630
Looks like an empty house.

64
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,170
Rocky

65
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,970
What a strange place.

66
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,510
It doesn't look like anyone lives
in these four or five houses.

67
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,280
Even the electricity to the
vending machine's been cut.

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,100
Huh?

69
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,740
That post box...

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,200
This is where we first turned.

71
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,410
How strange...

72
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,610
How did we end up back
where we started again?

73
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,000
But we turned right, left,
then right, so how...

74
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,250
It's possible that we're being
attacked by someone's Stand.

75
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,540
Huh? Stand?!

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,210
Koichi, would you have
Reverb fly up to the sky?

77
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,940
I see!

78
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,160
If it looks down from above,
we'll see which way to go.

79
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,630
Reverb Act 1!

80
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,210
What's the matter?

81
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,850
Th-There's something there.

82
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,810
Something touched it up in the sky.

83
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,410
I didn't see anything.

84
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,020
But something definitely touched it!

85
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,510
Are you two lost?

86
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,810
Want me to show you the way?

87
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,660
A girl!

88
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,030
That girl's a Stand user!

89
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,750
Heaven's Door!

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,820
Don't even give her a chance to speak!

91
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,550
Victory to the swiftest!

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,980
Boom

93
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,110
Now we're safe.

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,670
She won't be able to harm us.

95
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,740
That's amazing!

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,000
I-It looked like a drawing
leaped out just now...

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,530
I guess that means I've matured a bit.

98
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,580
Though it wouldn't work
on lame people like Josuke,

99
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,650
who don't like my manga.

100
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,000
We're on the same wavelength.

101
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,620
She's not a Stand user.
She's just a normal girl.

102
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,830
Huh? Sh-She's not an enemy?

103
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,910
Right. You can't hide
anything from Heaven's Door.

104
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,330
She's Reimi Sugimoto, age 16.

105
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,760
Her address is 3-12, Kotodai, Morioh.

106
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,040
It's right over there.

107
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,970
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Her measurements are 82-57-84 centimeters.

108
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,840
She has a mole on the
side of her left nipple.

109
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,550
She had her first period the
September after she turned 11.

110
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,760
The first time she kissed a boy,
he forced his tongue into her mouth.

111
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,090
Hey! Hold on a sec, Rohan Kishibe!

112
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,470
If that girl's not a Stand user,

113
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,790
then I won't allow you to
read any more about her!

114
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,770
All right, all right.

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,630
Don't get so angry.

116
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,240
"She'll forget everything
that just happened." There.

117
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,780
Want me to show you the way?

118
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,630
A lot of people get lost around here,

119
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,730
since all the alleys looks alike.

120
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,540
We'll be fine if you could
just tell us which way to go.

121
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,500
No, no. You won't understand
if I just explain it to you.

122
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I'll show you the way, so follow me.

123
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,250
Want one?

124
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,990
No?

125
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,680
Could you just grab the other end, then?

126
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,590
Snap

127
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,280
Aw, you're going to get dumped by some girl.

128
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,730
What are you talking about?

129
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,860
It's Pocky fortune-telling. How the
Pocky breaks tells me your fortune.

130
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,130
You're selfish, aren't you?

131
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,890
And you have a tendency to mess with people.

132
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,360
That's why you'll get dumped.

133
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,500
Did you hear that, Koichi?
She's completely off!

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,370
She called me selfish!

135
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,100
If we're going to play that game,
I know a thing or two, as well.

136
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,720
Light pink nail polish means you're
a coward when it comes to love.

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,020
You let true love slip away
at the crucial moment.

138
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,630
Huh?

139
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,550
No way...

140
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,860
This is a psychological test,
not fortune-telling.

141
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,410
Other than love, there's something else
scaring you right now, isn't there?

142
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,360
Apparently,

143
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,280
a murder took place at this
house about fifteen years ago.

144
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,320
A murder?!

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,910
Murder...

146
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,430
No one lives there now.

147
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,270
Do you want to hear about it?

148
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,250
I heard this from the old
lady who lives next door.

149
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,600
The night of the murder,

150
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,430
while the girl who lived here
was asleep in her bedroom,

151
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,300
she awoke to a "drip, drip" sound
coming from her parents' room.

152
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,430
She wondered what the sound was,
and called out to her parents,

153
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,450
but there was no reply.

154
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,190
But the girl wasn't that scared, because...

155
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,330
Her beloved dog was by her side.

156
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,810
Beloved dog?

157
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,870
Yes. He was a big guard dog.

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,000
Even in the dark, if she put
her hand underneath her bed,

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,980
he would whimper and lick her hand.

160
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,330
She felt safe because Arnold was with her.

161
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:28,840
But she heard the dripping sound
go on for more than ten minutes...

162
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,100
Finally, the girl decided to
find out what the sound was.

163
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,690
And then...

164
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,700
She found her beloved dog Arnold dead,

165
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,810
hanging from the coat rack.

166
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,610
His blood was the dripping
sound that she heard.

167
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,500
Suddenly, she heard a voice
from under the bed say,

168
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,740
"Your hand is so soft and cute,
Miss. Whimper, whimper..."

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,620
"I already killed your parents." And then...

170
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,190
The girl was killed, too!

171
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,790
I-Is that a true story?!

172
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,800
Did it sound like one? It was just
payback for trashing my nail polish.

173
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,400
Whew...

174
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,070
Th-That stuff is bad for my heart... Jeez...

175
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Drip

176
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,690
Wha—

177
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,860
That's...

178
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,080
Yes... That girl was me.

179
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,830
Both Arnold and I are ghosts.

180
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,030
G-Ghosts?

181
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,030
What my Stand, Heaven's Door, read

182
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,510
were memories from when she
was alive, so I couldn't tell.

183
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,850
You two walked into the place
where I died fifteen years ago.

184
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,800
I guess we're on the same wavelength.

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,330
This is the border between
the living world and the next.

186
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,400
Re

187

Rev

188

Let's get out of here, Koichi!

195
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,170
I-It's no use!

196
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,020
Use Reverb, Koichi!

197
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,150
Have it fly into the air and find the way!

198
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,260
She must have been what
touched it in the sky earlier.

199
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Just have it fly up already, Koichi!

200
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,890
Wha—

201
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,690
What?! There's suddenly a wall in the sky!

202
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,020
K-Koichi, Reverb is touching the ground.

203
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,990
Huh?! Ah, what?!

204
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,400
Y-You're the one who went
flying up into the air.

205
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,280
There's only one way out of this place.

206
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,680
And I know where it is.

207
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,930
H-How are we supposed to fight a ghost?

208
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,790
Please don't possess us!

209
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,100
Hey, hold on. Stop treating
me like a vengeful spirit.

210
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,020
What did I do to you?

211
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,680
You're the ones getting all scared on your own!

212
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm not the one who trapped you in here.

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,790
This is the border between
this world and the next.

214
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,320
You two have strange powers.

215
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,370
They're called Stands?

216
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,400
I wonder if that's how you ended up here.

217
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,270
You're not our enemy?

218
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,740
You really don't trust people, do you?

219
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,140
I think I'm what they call a bound spirit?

220
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,730
I became a ghost that can't leave here.

221
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,120
For fifteen years, I tried to speak to
various people who ended up here,

222
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,800
because I needed to tell someone.

223
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,210
But you're the first ones that
I've been able to talk to this much.

224
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,250
I told you I'd tell you how to get out of
here, and that's what I'm going to do.

225
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,220
After I finish the story, that is.

226
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,550
Story?

227
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,550
The rest of my story from earlier.

228
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,360
Before I could see the murderer's face,

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,620
I was stabbed in the back with a knife.

230
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,610
It was late at night and dark,

231
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,480
and I was desperately running away.

232
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,370
The murderer hasn't been caught yet.

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,650
He's somewhere in Morioh.

234
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,160
That's what I wanted to tell someone.

235
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
He's blended into this town.

236
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,930
Wait. Are you telling us because...

237
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm not asking you to catch him.

238
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,380
But I want you to tell someone...

239
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,060
Someone who can catch him, like the police...

240
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,130
Whoa, whoa. Why should we have
to do something like that?

241
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,660
Rohan-sensei!

242
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,890
It's fine. I just want to say the rational thing.

243
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,220
I do feel bad that you were killed...

244
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,490
But why should we have to find
the murderer just because of

245
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,690
your personal grudge and suffering?

246
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,990
I think, as a ghost, you'd be better off

247
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,240
cutting your ties to this world
and passing on into the next.

248
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,500
Do you even know how many boys and
girls have disappeared from this town?

249
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,950
Huh? No.

250
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,500
It's eight times the national average.

251
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm not saying it's all of them, but at least
some of them are being killed in secret.

252
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,610
By him.

253
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,520
W-Wait a second!

254
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,040
Are you saying these murders
are still happening?

255
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,410
Hey! Don't make baseless claims like that!

256
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,930
You just said you didn't
see the murderer's face!

257
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,270
So how would you know that?

258
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,480
The souls of the murdered
fly above here all the time!

259
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,940
And they all have a wound just like this.

260
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,200
H-How cruel... It's so long and deep...

261
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,100
I can't talk to those souls
going to the next world,

262
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,640
but I've seen them many times.

263
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,540
I know what he's into! I know!

264
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,870
These murders have been going on for

265
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,790
fifteen years here in Morioh,
where I was born and raised.

266
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,670
It's frightening, and it wounds my pride.

267
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,880
When they catch the murderer,
my beloved Morioh

268
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,140
will be known nationwide as a
town where a murderer lived.

269
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,770
But we have to stop the
murderer as soon as possible!

270
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,320
Even now, he's targeting someone,
and I can't do a thing.

271
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
Who's going to be killed next?

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,910
If you, the living, don't take
back this town's pride and peace,

273
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,290
who else is going to do it?!

274
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,420
I don't know if you understand
what I'm saying, but...

275
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,290
I'm done talking now.

276
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,470
A-All right. I'm very shocked.

277
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,600
But... Still, we have to do something.

278
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,660
Hmph. Stop being such a
goody-two-shoes, Koichi.

279
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,740
It's just going to be trouble.

280
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,880
But it might be good to go after
the murderer and interview him.

281
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,910
I might be able to draw a
really interesting manga!

282
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,410
Is the exit this way?

283
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,530
If you think he's a good person
deep down... well, you shouldn't.

284
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,560
He's pretty gray when it
comes to being trustworthy.

285
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,870
Hey, are you listening?

286
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,430
All right. I'll lead you to the exit.

287
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,100
Huh? The exit? Where? Where is it?

288
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,810
If you turn left past the
post box, it's right there.

289
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,160
Yay!

290
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,150
Don't rush!

291
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,160
There's a certain rule you have
to follow to get past there.

292
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,730
A rule?

293
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,210
Once you pass the post box and turn,

294
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,890
you'll be able to see the
exit about 20 meters away.

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,930
No matter what happens,

296
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,540
until you get there, promise
me that you won't turn around.

297
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,080
What? Why?

298
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,770
It's the rule for passing
from this world to the next.

299
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,040
Even Arnold understands that.

300
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Well, I guess we can promise to do
something even a dog can handle.

301
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,300
What happens if we turn around?

302
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,310
Our souls will be pulled into the
next world, which means you'll die.

303
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,190
Don't be frightened!

304
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,220
Just don't turn around. Simple, right?

305
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,580
R-Right when we passed the post box...

306
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,710
Something shot between our
legs and went behind us!

307
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,580
Don't turn around!

308
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,710
Just keep walking slowly and calmly.

309
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,370
R-Rohan-sensei, something is following us.

310
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,470
I know.

311
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,300
Something's there...

312
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,840
Something is right behind my head!

313
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,630
Don't worry about it!

314
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,570
There's always something trying
to make you turn around.

315
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,770
But as long as you don't
turn and look at it,

316
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,070
it can't touch you, so just
keep your wits about you.

317
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,580
N-Now a warm liquid is dripping down my neck...

318
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,750
You're almost there! That light is the exit.

319
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,580
What?

320
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,580
Huh?

321
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,230
Th-The exit...

322
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,210
But I can't take it any longer!

323
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,740
Rohan-sensei, let's run!

324
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,880
Don't panic!

325
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,550
It's going to try to trip you.

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,140
You're safe now.

327
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,840
You got through it.

328
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,140
You can turn around from there.

329
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,900
That was so scary! I'm so relieved!

330
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,430
That was a lie, Koichi!

331
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,860
That wasn't really me just now!

332
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,950
Huh?

333
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,780
Impossible...

334
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,430
Not yet. Don't look back yet.

335
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,240
This didn't happen when I was by myself.

336
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,740
They didn't try to trick me!

337
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,130
Koichi!

338
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,380
Hmph. I don't really get it,
but we just can't look, right?

339
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,380
You're lucky you're with me, Koichi.

340
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,720
Heaven's Door!

341
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,550
You won't be able to see,
and you'll be blown away.

342
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,250
Crash

343
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,630
Boom

344
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,890
Calm down, Koichi.

345
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,150
I'll write that you can see again now.

346
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,740
The road between the convenience
store and drugstore is gone.

347
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,120
W-We made it back...

348
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,420
We'll always be here.

349
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,540
Until the murderer's caught.

350
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,310
The day that Arnold and I turn around to go

351
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,310
where my mom and dad are will be

352
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,420
when the pride and peace
of this town are restored.

353
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,580
Until then, I can't leave here.

354
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,980
If you ever need to ask me anything,

355
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,440
come by any time.

356
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
We can see each other any time,

357
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,690
Rohannie and Koichi...

358
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,630
I thank you from the bottom of my heart

359
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,650
for listening to what I had to say.

360
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,460
That girl had some nerve, calling me "Rohannie."

361
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,800
She was getting too friendly.

362
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,870
But... Reimi Sugimoto, huh...

363
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,710
There's something admirable
about how that ghost lives.

364
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,030
She's been fighting for fifteen years,
alone, for the sake of the living.

365
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,520
Zero Clues Found in Family Massacre

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,060
Sugimoto
Reimi

368
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,260
There it is! Sugimoto Reimi, age 16.

369
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,030
Not that I doubted her,
but now I've got some clues.

370
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,530
Ah, could you be...

371
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,660
Rohan Kishibe, who became a manga artist?

372
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,330
You know me?

373
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,370
Rohan, you were only four,

374
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,380
so it's no surprise that you
don't remember that incident.

375
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,710
Your house at the time was very near theirs.

376
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,370
The night of that incident,
your parents had urgent business

377
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,760
they had to attend to and
were forced to leave...

378
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,100
So they left you overnight
at the Sugimoto household

379
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,110
because you were all very close.

380
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,360
That night, Rohan, you were staying
overnight at the Sugimoto household.

381
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,870
And you were the only one to survive.

382
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,580
I was... there?

383
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:56,000
Sugimoto
Family
Grave

384
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,530
When the police found you,

385
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,000
you kept crying and repeating
the same thing over and over.

386
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,260
"Reimi snuck me out the window."

387
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Reimi saved you before you
could be found by the murderer.

388
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,350
That little girl... No wonder
she acted all friendly with me.

389
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:21,020
I can't read my distant memories nor
my fate with my Stand, Heaven's Door.

390
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,810
If you happen to wander down this path,

391
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,120
do not turn around, no matter what.

392
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Morioh Landmark 6
"The Path Where You Can
Meet a Girl's Ghost"
How to get there: Take the #11 bus
from Morioh Station and get off
at the Kotodai Shopping District.
It will appear between the
convenience store, Owson,
and Kisara Drugstore at 2-chome.
Warning: Most people won't be
able to see it, but if you happen
to wander down this path, do not
turn around, no matter what.

393
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,920
I really met a ghost!

394
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,090
The girl in that picture is Reimi!

395
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,090
Okay, we get it.

396
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,820
So, I researched her,

397
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,970
I said I believe you, didn't I? Right, Okuyasu?

398
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,580
and she was also a student
at Budogaoka High School.

399
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,120
She's cute... She's my type.

400
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,220
I wish I'd been born fifteen years sooner.

401
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,260
We should eventually go meet this ghost, too.

402
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,420
But, Koichi, if we tell Jotaro
or Old Man Joseph about this,

403
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,230
they're probably going to ask one thing.

404
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,570
"Is the murderer a Stand user?"

405
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,240
W-Well... I don't know...

406
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,490
Then we'll just have to let the
police and the courts deal with it.

407
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,870
B-But there's a murderer in Morioh!

408
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,250
I know. And that's why I'm saying that
Jotaro and the Speedwagon Foundation

409
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,590
won't just go after a normal murderer.

410
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,510
Calm down.

411
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,220
He's managed to escape from the
almighty police for the past fifteen years.

412
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,680
It's not like we'd run into him right away,
like we'd hailed a taxi cab.

413
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,480
Let's stay calm and look into this carefully.

414
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,300
So what did Rohan have to say?

415
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,980
The same thing as you, Josuke.

416
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,040
Hey, look out, Koichi.

417
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,260
Don't cross the road when
you're all spaced out.

418
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,740
S-Sorry...

419
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,550
Originally, Morioh was a resort filled
with villas that belonged to samurai.

420
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,780
My ancestors were among them.

421
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,210
But we were ruined during
my grandfather's time.

422
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,980
All that's left is the house that I live in now.

423
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,560
And I'm stuck working a trivial office job.

424
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,270
Hey, what did you do with the
imported wristwatch I bought you?

425
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,930
Ah, it's in your bag. That's right.

426
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,740
It was a little too big for you.

427
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,280
Let's get it fixed tomorrow.

428
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,420
What's wrong? Why are you acting so shy?

429
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
Now... Watch your step.

430
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,570
Let's enjoy this weekend to the fullest.

431
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,640
Just the two of us.

432
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,280
You just dripped something...

433
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,600
How rude you are.

434
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
You need to clean that up yourself.

435
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,750
I can't remember what your name was,
but that's all right.

436
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,000
Well done. You cleaned it all off.

437
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,910
Now, then...

438
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,050
Let's make dinner together.

439
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,570
What's the dish that you're best at?

440
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,850
Kira

441
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,020
