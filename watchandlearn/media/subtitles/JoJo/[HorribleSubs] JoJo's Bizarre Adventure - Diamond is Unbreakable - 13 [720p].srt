JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,400
Diamond is Unbreakable

4
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,760
Episode 13  We Picked Up Something Crazy!

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,310
Next on Morioh Radio, we have a
letter from "Troubled Lonesome Boy."

6
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,490
"Kai, listen to this.

7
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,160
I can't get a hold of my girlfriend
at all and it's making me blue."

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,070
I wonder if she's mad because
I proposed suddenly.

9
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,320
And I spent all my pay on an engagement
ring with a ruby, her birthstone...

10
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,960
So you were able to successfully
retrieve the bow and arrow.

11
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,850
Yeah, from Akira Otoishi's place.

12
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,960
He'd been committing burglaries with his Stand.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,130
Roughly 500 million yen worth.

14
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,920
The police are still looking into it.

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,880
Try doing something with your Stand again.

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,430
I'll send you to the ends of
the Earth and kill you there.

17
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,180
I'll be safest in prison!

18
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,740
Chili Pepper's in pieces.

19
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,380
Even if he gets out of jail,
I'm sure he won't try anything again.

20
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,980
Jotaro, what are you going
to do with the bow and arrow?

21
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,850
The Speedwagon Foundation is going
to hold on to it and research it.

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,520
It's a crucial piece of evidence we can use
to unravel the mystery behind Stands.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
That's great.

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
Thank goodness!

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,600
That means this incident's been resolved!

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,880
It didn't end up being that big
a deal, but yay! Hooray!

27
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,170
I'm still questioning Otoishi about the Stand

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,380
users that were created here.

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,540
Stay on your guard, just in case.

30
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,610
Right.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,610
Sure.

32
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,610
Yeah.

33
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,300
Coffee in Japan is still the best.

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,740
Waitress, can I get a refill?

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,300
Whoa! Jeez.

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,960
Be more careful. I look away for a second and...

37
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,210
Josuke, don't you have to go?
The bus will be here soon.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,960
R-Right...

39
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,330
Yeah. Come on, let's go. Stand up.

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,840
I wonder if those two will be okay.

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm worried.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,010
Whoa, this cake is so good!

43
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,010
Can I get another slice, waitress?

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,990
Hello, this is the Higashikata resid—

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,040
Hey, Mom. It's me.

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,650
Josuke? It's unusual for you to call me.

47
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,470
Do you need something?

48
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,030
Well, uh... Hey, y-you're going
to be home all day today, right?

49
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,860
Yeah? What about it?

50
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,320
N-Nothing! As long as you're
there, it's fine. Bye!

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,420
Hey!

52
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,210
What was that all about?

53
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,420
He'd better not be planning
something weird again.

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,360
Crap. I hope Mom didn't
think that was weird.

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,270
Oh, for crying out loud...

56
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,270
I told him to wait until I was
done with the phone call!

57
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,080
Hey, wait!

58
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,370
Hello? Can you hear me? Hey!

59
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,590
Did you just call for me?

60
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,660
Yeah. We can't get a taxi at this hour,

61
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,100
so we're going to take the bus to my house.

62
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,760
And... I know I'm being pushy, but I'm
going to confirm one more time.

63
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,550
You can only look from a distance.

64
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,360
Make sure you don't talk to my mom!

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
Promise me that.

66
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,770
My mom won't be happy just
because you came to visit.

67
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,230
She's gonna be a wreck.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,230
I know that. I promise.

69
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,700
Also, one more thing.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm gonna be calling you Mr. Joestar.

71
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,250
Huh?

72
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,680
W-Well, you know... I might
as well lay it on the line now.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,830
I mean, it might seem cold,

74
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:28,110
but calling someone I just met "Dad"
or "Pops" is just not happening.

75
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,070
So after you see my mom, I want
you to go right back to America.

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,420
Right...

77
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,750
You're absolutely right. I understand.

78
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,350
Man, this is awkward.

79
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,550
I know it's best to be honest, but still,

80
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,080
there are some things between
people that just aren't possible.

81
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,210
Hey, Mr. Joestar...

82
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,040
Excuse me, did you see where the burly
old man who was just here went?

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,370
He got onto that long-distance bus.

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
Bright Deer

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
Long Distance Bus

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
To Sapporo

87
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,910
Y-You can't be serious! Damn it!

88
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,830
I'm sorry about that.

89
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,310
You said we were getting on a bus, so...

90
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,400
But I'm surprised you caught
up to the bus by running.

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,890
We were just about to get onto the freeway.

92
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,070
Right now, I'm thinking it might have
been better to just let you go...

93
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,120
To Hokkaido!

94
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,770
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

95
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,010
Sorry about that.

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,040
Josuke...

97
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,430
Something seems to be
pulling on my trousers.

98
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,050
Oh, really? Don't let them
drag you off somewhere again.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,050
Wha...

100
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,850
J-Josuke! There's a Stand user nearby!

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,280
Yup, there sure is.
Two, in fact... Me and you.

102
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,150
Anyway, is there a vending
machine nearby? I need a drink.

103
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,400
Wh-What is this? They're not footsteps.

104
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,210
Hands? Hand prints?

105
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,140
Oh my God! Josuke, the Stand just laughed!

106
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,880
See? Right here! On top of the sand!

107
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,720
There's no way I'm letting him see my mom.

108
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,860
Now he's seeing and hearing things.

109
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,720
This is concrete!

110
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,150
Where did it go? Where is it? It's gone!

111
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,490
Where did you go? It's gone!

112
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,910
Great. This old man is seriously bad news.

113
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,000
Hermit Purple!

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
Get out of here, you mutt! Shoo! Shoo!

115
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you hear something crying?

116
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,030
It's right here, Josuke.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,770
A baby! There's a naked baby right here.

118
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,780
I can tell when I'm touching it. It's invisible!

119
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,160
What?!

120
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,080
I-It's there!

121
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,660
It's really there!

122
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,880
It's all squishy.

123
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,260
Well, I'll be damned.

124
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,800
It's an invisible baby!

125
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,260
It feels like it's only about
six months old or so.

126
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,580
But how did a baby turn invisible out here?

127
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,050
I'm assuming it's a Stand ability, but...

128
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,160
There are a lot of questions,
like, "Why did the enemy

129
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,200
Stand user make it invisible,"
and "Where is its mom?"

130
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,200
Josuke, I think the baby
is actually the Stand user.

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,170
It's a Stand user without realizing it.

132
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,440
Because it's been separated from its
mother, it instinctively went invisible.

133
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,210
Huh?

134
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,310
Even adults can develop ulcers,
spot baldness, and gray hair

135
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,220
before they realize it for
psychological reasons, right?

136
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,970
I believe that finding its mother
will be the way to solve this.

137
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,580
H-Hey, just hurry up and make it stop crying.

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,080
I-I'm not really sure what to do, either.

139
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,260
I did something similar to this,
but that was a very long time ago.

140
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,610
There, there...

141
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,060
Th-This is...

142
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,520
Did you figure something out?

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,370
Yes, when I just touched it now.

144
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,970
It's a little girl.

145
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,250
Right, the way to tell if it's a boy
or a girl is between the legs!

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,430
Did you find out something else?

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,660
Josuke,

148
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,010
do you have any tissues?

149
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,260
Th-That smell...

150
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,300
I-Is there one on your hand? A huge one?

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,360
I-It's invisible, so I couldn't tell
for sure until I could smell it.

152
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,930
And I just scratched my beard with this hand!

153
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,330
Shi

154
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:48,410
Shini

155
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,500
Shinin

156
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,580
Shining

157
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:48,710
Shining D

158
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,790
Shining Di

159
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,870
Shining Dia

160
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,960
Shining Diamo

161
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,040
Shining Diamon

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,000
Shining Diamond

163
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,710
Jo

164
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:49,830
Josuke

165
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:49,960
Josuke Higashi

166
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Josuke Higashikata

167
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,170
I'm returning your manuscript to you.

168
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll be looking forward to those
fixes for the volumes, Sensei.

169
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,990
For the time being, we're gonna
have to get milk and diapers.

170
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,640
And since she's naked,
we need to get her some clothes.

171
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,170
I'm counting on you, Mr. Joestar.

172
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,820
What? I-I'm buying them?

173
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,830
Of course. Look at me.

174
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,920
It'd be too embarrassing
for me to buy baby goods.

175
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,610
There'd be rumors that

176
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,990
a 16-year-old delinquent like
me got some girl pregnant.

177
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,700
But I only have American traveler's checks.

178
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,590
Oh, fine...

179
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,250
You can use my credit card.

180
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,970
Sorry about that.

181
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,800
Don't buy anything too expensive.

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,110
I've worked hard to build up my
savings, and I don't have much!

183
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,640
I got it, I got it.

184
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,560
Welcome.

185
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Can I help you find something?

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,370
Um... Do you carry disposable diapers?

187
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,400
Of course! Is this your first time here?

188
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,580
Yes, it is, but...

189
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,580
These diapers are easy to change,
even if you're living on your own.

190
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,170
You won't have to worry overnight, either.

191
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,170
Silky Smooth Underwear
For Adults

192
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,390
Um... I'm looking for a baby, not myself.

193
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,750
P-Pardon me! So you're
looking for baby diapers.

194
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,180
Were you looking for cloth diapers,
or disposable pull-ups?

195
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,270
Uh... What was that?

196
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,130
As you can see, this one
will need a diaper cover,

197
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,440
but the disposable pull-up
is simple and economical.

198
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,900
I-I don't really know, so could you just...

199
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,660
What size do you need?

200
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,410
Size?

201
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,560
How old is the baby?

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,100
Depending on the baby's size,

203
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,470
we have newborn, S-size, M-size,
L-size, XL-size, boys' and girls'.

204
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,920
Th-There are that many options nowadays?

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,340
W-Well, she's a girl, and when
I held her, she was about this big.

206
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,350
What do you mean by "when I held her," sir?

207
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,900
It'd be inconvenient for us
if you bought diapers

208
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,360
that were too big, and then

209
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,750
tried to return them after
they've been pooped in.

210
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,140
Oh, all right. Give me all of the sizes.

211
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,070
I also need baby wipes,
powdered milk, and baby bottles...

212
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,120
For baby bottles, we have glass or plastic.

213
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,120
Huh?

214
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,900
Glass ones don't scratch or
start to smell as easily,

215
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,380
but they are a bit heavy for a baby to hold.

216
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,390
The plastic ones are light,
but may have a noticeable smell.

217
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,040
Which one would you like?

218
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,300
U-U-Uh... Um...

219
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,890
We also have various shapes and designs.

220
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,900
We have ones shaped like
rocket ships and racing cars.

221
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
This one, the baby can hold by itself.

222
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,860
And this one, if you turn it
upside-down, the doll inside moves.

223
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,630
I-I have no idea, so if you
could just throw in a few...

224
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,740
And which bottle nipples
would you like, sir?

225
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,300
Rubber ones are soft,
but don't last very long.

226
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,100
Silicon ones last, but are a bit hard.

227
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,280
This one is called a "Chupatoreni."

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,600
There's a diaphragm where
the nipple goes in the mouth,

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,930
and the flow of milk is adjusted
by how hard the baby sucks on it.

230
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,950
This is a NUK from Germany.

231
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,220
The shape is slightly flattened, and is said to

232
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,800
more closely resemble
a mother's natural shape.

233
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,270
And just like when drinking breast
milk, it will not come out

234
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,160
unless they use their jaws.

235
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,980
O-Oh, all right. Whatever is fine.
Just give me all of them.

236
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,230
As for the nipple holes, we have round,
Y-shaped, and cross-shaped varieties.

237
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,460
J-Just give me all of them.

238
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,080
And some baby clothes and socks, too.

239
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,710
I'll be paying by card.

240
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,420
Thank you very much, sir.

241
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,270
130,000... I don't really
understand yen that well.

242
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,060
I wonder how much that is in dollars.

243
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,490
If 100 yen is about 80 cents...

244
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,750
Well, whatever.

245
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,550
I didn't waste any money,
and it's just baby stuff.

246
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm sure it can't be that expensive.

247
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,980
Damn it...

248
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
What's he doing? He's taking forever.

249
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,950
By the way...

250
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,760
The girl who got the ring.
I wonder what happened with that.

251
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,080
Since he didn't get an answer,
I wonder if that was a no.

252
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,250
They could be super conflicted about it.

253
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,570
I can't stay here...

254
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,910
If people from school find me here...

255
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,210
Sorry to keep you waiting, Josuke.

256
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,210
Here's your card back.

257
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,990
You're done? A-All right, let's go.

258
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,300
Now we won't have to worry
about losing sight of her, but...

259
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,120
If strangers see that she doesn't
have a face, they'll be creeped out.

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,850
I thought about that and...

261
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,730
bought some makeup, too.

262
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,220
Let's try some foundation first. There we go!

263
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,920
Hey, I think she might actually be cute.

264
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,910
My, what a beauty!

265
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,500
This face will help us find her mom.

266
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,090
We've finally got some hope. We can do this!

267
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,760
That was a good idea!

268
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,720
Good, good! All right,
now let's try some lipstick.

269
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,850
And let's draw on some eyebrows
and eyelashes... Like that.

270
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,120
I knew he'd do that...

271
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,500
So this geezer's the type to get carried
away when you compliment him.

272
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,860
Now we can finally take you around
without having to worry too much.

273
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,670
We can't put makeup on your eyes,
so we'll just have to use sunglasses.

274
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,390
That looks great!

275
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,370
Here's some milk.

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,330
Maybe I went too light on the foundation.

277
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,100
It looks like it's starting to come off...

278
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,500
Th-That's not it!

279
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,100
What is this?! Sh-She's...

280
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,850
Sh-She disappeared! And so did my hands!

281
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,060
This baby's not just making herself invisible!

282
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,620
She's making everything
around her invisible, too!

283
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,690
Mr. Joestar! Let go of the baby!

284
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm telling you to hurry up
and let go of the baby!

285
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,690
Th-They're still invisible,
even though I let go of her.

286
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,030
She's powering up!

287
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,050
This isn't good.

288
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,150
It looks like everything within
about thirty centimeters

289
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,010
of that baby is becoming invisible.

290
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,850
But this doesn't make sense.

291
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,450
If she keeps trying to protect
herself with her Stand,

292
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,270
who could even feed her or take care of her?

293
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,900
So it must be due to feelings of anxiety.

294
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,820
It's stress.

295
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,990
She doesn't want to be touched
by someone she doesn't know.

296
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,570
If she powers up any more,
no one will be able to get near her.

297
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,620
We'll end up invisible, too.

298
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,020
That's some weird junk.
I wonder who's gonna clean it up.

299
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,130
Well, I guess someone will do it.

300
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,700
Not me, though.

301
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,550
Look out!

302
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,650
What happened?

303
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,500
This lit cigarette butt was...
Oh, you can't see it.

304
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,480
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Joestar?!

305
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,820
Don't space out at a time like this!

306
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,570
I, uh...

307
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,040
The stroller completely disappeared!

308
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,380
And the ground, too!

309
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,160
So it is stress!

310
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,520
The more scared she gets,
the wider her range gets!

311
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,680
That's the sound of the stroller flipping over!

312
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,010
The invisible baby... fell into the water?!

313
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,650
Wh-Where is she? Make some noise!

314
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,940
I can't even see any bubbles! Where is she?!

315
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,900
J-Josuke...

316
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,070
Shut up!

317
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,560
This all happened because he
couldn't keep it together.

318
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,590
That stupid old geezer!

319
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,280
This irresponsible guy is my father?

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,790
He's so irresponsible, he was okay with
abandoning my mom for sixteen years.

321
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,410
There's no way in hell I can
respect someone like him.

322
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,510
There's no way we can get along.

323
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,640
You stay out of this.

324
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,100
Where is she? She should
be right around here.

325
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,710
I don't care if I turn invisible, too.

326
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,520
Just hurry up and touch me!

327
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,990
Come on!

328
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,480
She's not here... Hurry!

329
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,340
Damn it! How the hell am I supposed to find

330
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,870
an invisible baby in clear water?!

331
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,370
Josuke, I...

332
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,320
might die in just a moment,
so when that happens,

333
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,360
please give my regards to your mother.

334
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,020
I mean...

335
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,450
I am quite old now.

336
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,480
What the hell are you doing?!

337
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,070
I'm adding color to the water...

338
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,740
It's the center...

339
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,590
The color of the blood is turning
more and more invisible.

340
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,920
The child is in the center.

341
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,430
Mr. Joestar...

342
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,320
No one else would think to do this.

343
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,980
Not for someone else's child,
who they've never seen before...

344
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,980
They wouldn't go this far.

345
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,560
I wanted to look cool

346
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
in front of you.

347
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,330
H

348
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,450
Her

349
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,540
Herm

350
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,620
Hermi

351
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,750
Hermit

352
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,830
Hermit P

353
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,950
Hermit Pur

354
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,040
Hermit Purp

355
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Hermit Purple

356
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,540
J

357
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:54,580
Jo

358
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:54,620
Jose

359
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,700
Joseph

360
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:54,790
Joseph J

361
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:54,830
Joseph Jo

362
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,870
Joseph Joe

363
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,910
Joseph Joes

364
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:54,950
Joseph Joest

365
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,960
Joseph Joestar

366
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,230
Well, a lot happened...

367
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,670
But it looks like everything
worked out for now.

368
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,460
O-One hundred and thirty thousand yen?!

369
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,000
The savings I worked so hard for...

370
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,290
That stupid geezer!

371
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,980
There, there.
