00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,040
There's nothing in there.
Both pockets are empty.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,770
Other than this piece of paper...

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,510
The scent is no longer in the pocket...

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,410
Could it be...

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,140
It's just a plain, white piece of paper.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,630
What?!

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,670
Blam

00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,970

Swip

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,280
Now you've done it!

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,050
You should really be more careful.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,360
I told you that the floor up
here was burnt, too, didn't I?

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,620
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,450
It's a perfectly fine back...

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,040
I-It's over... I'm finished...

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,530
I don't know why,

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,240
but I have this fear that if
someone sees it, it's all over!

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,590
H-Hey...

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm already finished!

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,470
C-Calm down.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,770
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,860
I just couldn't hold back my curiosity...

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,740
What?!

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,220
That's a Stand attack!

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,650
There's a Stand on his back?!

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,290
If there is, then even if I read
him with Heaven's Door...

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,370
I see. No wonder there was nothing written.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,490
This architect had already been
attacked before he came here.

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,630
This architect was a victim

32
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,510
of the enemy Stand that's
going to attack me.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,960
Carry me on your back.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
It's here! The enemy Stand is here!

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,700
Carry me on your back. Okay?

36
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,470
Carry me on your back.

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,070
On your back... Carry me on your back, okay?

These are all the people missing
from Morioh, including runaways.

Episode 33    July 15th (Thurs), Part 3

43
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,130
These are all from after Kira disappeared,
so there aren't that many.

44
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,400
So there's a possibility that Kira's
victims might be among them.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm not sure about that,
but the possibility exists.

46
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,310
What's important is to not
miss any of his movements.

47
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,750
If a guy holding his breath makes
even the slightest movement,

48
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,540
there will be some kind of change.

Carry me on your back.

Carry me on your back, okay?

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,660
Carry me on your back.

58
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,970
What?! I-It can't be...

59
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,110
Has it possessed my back?

60
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,020
Did it transfer to me because
I saw the architect's back?

61
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,860
Damn it!

62
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,780
Burn the pictures...

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,500
Hey, burn the pictures.

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,270
Pictures?

65
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,080
Burn them, okay? Burn away those pictures...

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,720
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,050
The pictures I took...

68
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,990
Could it be there's one among them

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,080
that might get us closer to Yoshikage Kira,

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,310
and you're here to get rid of it?

71
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,060
Just burn all of them, okay?
Burn them away, okay?

72
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,520
Shut up!

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,400
Heaven's Door!

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,570
Let's see...

75
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,640
If I read about who you are
and write in some orders...

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,740
Ow!

77
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,920
What?!

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm a Stand that was born when

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,200
Masazo Kinoto's back was
pierced with an arrow...

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,560
Cheap Trap.

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,240
But my user now is you, Rohan Kishibe.

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,080
You're my user now.

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,930
Wha?!

84
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,090
Do you get it?

85
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,560
It basically means that you're
using a Stand to attack yourself.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,470
You get that? Okay?

87
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm a Stand with a will of my own.

88
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,150
Even though Masazo Kinoto created me,

89
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,750
he couldn't become a Stand user
that could actually control me.

90
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,300
He could only hear my whispers,

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,810
and had only the fear that he mustn't
let anyone see his back, okay?

92
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,010
Do you get it? Okay? Do you get it?

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,950
Do you get it? Okay?

94
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,900
My ability is to just whisper to people.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Okay? If you get it, burn the pictures.

96
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,830
You bastard... Get away from me!

97
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,520
Damn it! Why, you...

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,190
How do I get you off of me?!

99
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,440
That's easy. You just have
to show someone else.

100
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,260
If you show someone your back...

101
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,620
Okay? I'll go away and transfer over there.

102
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
You just have to show someone.

103
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,110
Hello, Rohan-sensei!

104
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,330
I always read your manga.

105
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,940
Next time, could you draw a nude?

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,730
A nude girl!

107
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,260
Bye!

108
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,650
Burn the pictures, okay?

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,580
July 15th (Thurs)  12:47 PM

110
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,290
Josuke!

111
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,300
H-He wasn't shot.

112
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,170
Y-You asshole!

113
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,750
Shining Diamond, eh?

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,220
Well, looks like it's just as I heard,

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,930
and a bullet from a gun won't do much...

116
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,610
That was scary, right?
Bite it, Josuke Higashikata.

117
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,950
Bite your lower lip.

118
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,130
Are you gonna bite it?!

119
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,490
Bite it! Come on, just bite it
and show me your sign!

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,690
So this is his Stand?

121
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,410
Pretty crappy-looking Stand,
just like the old man in the picture!

122
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,320
Not going to bite it yet, I see...

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,870
Looks like he's covering up his fear with anger.

124
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,670
I guess I have no choice.
I'll have to show myself.

125
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,970
You've got some nerve, you asshole!

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,660
This is it... This creepiness.

127
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,000
He's been hiding all this time,
so why is he coming out now?

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,570
He showed up on purpose.

129
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,360
He showed up on purpose
so you would attack him!

130
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,160
He's dangerous... He's too dangerous, Josuke!

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,990
True... My Stand's ability
might be a crappy one.

132
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,060
But if I were to explain my ability to you...

133
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,400
I can make various things

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,230
into paper and file them away,
and it's extremely useful.

135
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,080
And this paper is Koichi Hirose.

136
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,180
You bastard... So that's
where you were hiding Koichi!

137
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,800
That's Koichi's scent.

138
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,440
He didn't have something of Koichi's...
He had Koichi himself!

139
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,700
He's alive, of course, because my
Stand ability is a crappy one.

140
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,790
I don't have the power or
ability to kill someone.

141
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,530
Though that's not the case if someone
rips it up, like I did just now.

142
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,250
I'll let you off the hook with just an ass-kicking

143
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,580
if you bring Koichi back here right now.

144
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,120
Just try and get him...

145
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,070
If you can.

146
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,280
Koichi Hirose

147
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,040
Koichi!

148
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,720
Because my Stand ability is a crappy one.

149
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,410
I don't have the power or
ability to kill someone.

150
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,350
Though that's not the case
if someone rips it up.

151
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,280
That's the trap!

152
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,100
If it were me, I wouldn't
go after that paper.

153
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,440
Josuke, ignore it.

154
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,090
You bit it! You finally bit it!

155
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,030
Misterioso was waiting for this
moment, Josuke Higashikata!

156
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,830
It was waiting for the moment you bit your lip!

157
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,800
You bastard...

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,810
You showed your sign of fear!

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,740
No matter how you resist,
once you've shown your fear,

160
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,390
you're powerless before Misterioso.

161
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,170
Thud

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,510
I feel bad for Josuke,
but I'm glad I didn't help him.

163
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,170
If I had helped him, that guy
would have probably

164
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,270
gotten rid of me first, since I can find scents.

165
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,180
Do you understand now that there's no power

166
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,040
in the world that can stop Misterioso?

167
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,380
Wh-What?

168
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,530
That metal rod is fixed...

169
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,850
He's trying to use that power to get out.

170
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,200
That paper there

171
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,770
is probably not the paper
that Koichi's trapped in.

172
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,150
I knew it was just bait with the name
"Koichi Hirose" written on it.

173
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,510
That's because the only reason you
were confident enough to show yourself

174
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,710
was because you were holding
Koichi as a hostage,

175
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,240
and it's because he's alive
that you can threaten me.

176
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,190
I knew that piece of paper was a trap...

177
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,320
It was, wasn't it?

178
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,770
But the reason I still tried
to save that piece of paper

179
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,430
was because there was still a
possibility that it was Koichi.

180
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,140
If there's even a 1% chance that it's Koichi,

181
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,890
then my only choice is to try to save him!

182
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,770
Misterioso, you win.

183
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,580
Looks like this is as far as
Shining Diamond's powers go.

184
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,530
However, let me just warn you of one thing...

185
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,400
If you turn me into paper,

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,040
you should immediately rip
me up and get rid of me.

187
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,460
If I'm able to come back
from this, I will kill you!

188
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,460
L-Look at you, talking big...

189
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,350
You weren't a big deal at all.

190
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,100
Koichi Hirose

191
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,640
Yuya Fungami, huh?

192
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,490
Not helping out Josuke was
a very smart thing to do.

193
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,120
I could have gotten rid of you easily.

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,100
Your sign of fear is to poke at
your chin with your fingers.

195
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,550
But the old man in the picture
didn't tell me to get rid of you,

196
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,420
so I guess you get to stay alive.

197
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,680
That's the smart thing to do.

198
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,290
Want to hear something
interesting about this paper?

199
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,650
Anyone can take out what's
inside if they open it.

200
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,500
It's a very simple thing to do, but it's
quite hard for someone who's in fear.

201
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,780
To Morioh Grand Hotel.

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,300
All right! We got rid of
Koichi Hirose and Josuke Higashikata!

203
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,240
Right about now,
Rohan Kishibe should also be...

204
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,160
July 15th (Thurs)  2:21 PM

205
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,000
Which is it?

206
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,720
Which picture has something
to do with Yoshikage Kira?

207
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,090
Which picture is the old man in
the photo trying to get rid of?

208
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,470
Burn them, okay? Burn them.

209
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,830
It's no use...

210
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,530
Right now, there aren't enough clues.

211
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,820
So let's burn the pictures, okay?

212
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,480
Shut up! You're annoying!

213
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,140
Damn it! I have to let them know...

214
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,860
I have to let someone know about this thing.

215
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,610
Mis

216
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:26,820
Miste

217
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,070
Misterio

218
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,030
Misterioso

219
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:27,740
Teru

220
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:27,820
Terunosu

221
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:27,910
Terunosuke

222
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,990
Terunosuke Miya

223
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,030
Terunosuke Miyamoto

224
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,950
July 15th (Thurs)  1:20 PM

225
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,060
Er, that was Morioh Grand Hotel, right?

226
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,540
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,200
Are you spending the night?

228
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,340
No, there's a lot there, so...

229
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,430
A lot there, indeed...

230
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,410
No...

231
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,790
You won't be going to Morioh Grand Hotel.

232
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,430
Josuke, you bastard!
Trying to play it cool...

233
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,560
If, just if, as stupid as this is,
if the one turned into paper

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,340
was one of my girls who
makes me smile every day...

235
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,650
If it was any one of my girls,

236
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,930
I would have done the same thing!

237
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,250
Letting you or Yoshikage Kira live
in this town would be totally uncool.

238
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,020
Hand over Koichi!

239
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,970
What you're doing right now
isn't the smart thing to do.

240
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,310
So you're saying that you want to fight me?

241
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,630
You're saying that you're going
to make Kira's dad your enemy?

242
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,390
Very well!

243
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,380
63, 64, 65 kilometers...

244
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,060
Though it lacks power, my Highway
Go Go will never stop its pursuit.

245
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,030
The taxi stopped...

246
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,780
Even though it's not at the hotel yet.

247
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,160
No one's gotten out of the taxi yet.

248
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,860
His scent is emanating
strongly from the car...

249
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,880
But where is he? Where is he hiding?

250
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,720
The scent of this paper...

251
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,340
There's no doubt about it!

252
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,590
This paper smells like Koichi and Josuke!

253
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,640
Wait, Highway Go Go!
Don't open the door just yet.

254
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,910
That bastard is underestimating me.

255
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,040
This must be another trap.

256
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,350
So he's trying to lure me in, huh?

257
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,630
Very well, I accept!

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,120
I said I would do it!

259
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,900
He's after my fear.

260
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
How is he going to try to scare me?

261
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,170
I need to find that out.

262
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,660
What? What is this piece
of paper stuck in the door?

263
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,590
Underestimating me again. This scent...

264
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,430
This piece of paper is the trap.

265
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,400
I figured out what kind of trap it is.

266
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,300
Open the door, Highway Go Go.

267
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,560
Foom

268
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,330
To think he can turn flames into paper, too...

269
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,530
But I saw through the trap!

270
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,400
Josuke, Koichi, I'll save the two of you!

271
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,210
But I smell something other
than Josuke and Koichi...

272
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,660
This looks dangerous to
just go ahead and open.

273
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,090
What is this?

274
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,840
A scent I've never smelled
before is moving around.

275
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,170
It's faint, but it's moving
inside the paper...

276
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,760
What?!

277
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,260
Crap! Highway Go Go!

278
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,920
Wh-What is this liquid?

279
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,850
I-Is it some kind of chemical?

280
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,410
Damn it, it's one thing after another...

281
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,810
W-Wait...

282
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,300
I smell iron from inside there.

283
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,780
C-Calm down. What he's after is my fear.

284
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,350
If he manages to scare me, he wins.

285
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,870
Iron...

286
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,490
What is it? A machine?

287
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,250
Damn it!

288
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,290
I have no choice but to open it!

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,090
Koichi Hirose

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,090
Josuke Higashikata

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,090
Josuke! Koichi!

292
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,170
Th-That's an electrical current.

293
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,730
He's even got electricity inside the paper!

294
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,180
The smell of machinery that I could
smell from this paper was...

295
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,100
A...

296
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,860
A shredder!

297
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,130
It won't turn off!

298
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,240
Josuke and Koichi are getting sucked in!

299
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,580
Damn it! Highway Go Go!

300
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,850
I-It's no use.

301
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,550
Highway Go Go's powers can't
destroy this thing to stop it!

302
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,490
Josuke! Koichi!

303
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,060
You finally touched it, Yuya Fungami.

304
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,620
You finally got scared
and touched your chin...

305
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,810
You look pathetic.

306
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,930
It was so easy to scare you, Yuya Fungami!

307
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,750
There's no one that Misterioso
can't turn into paper!

308
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,150
No matter who it is, it can do it easily!

309
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,320
Easy? That's why it's so great!

310
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,630
It turns anyone into paper instantly...

311
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,940
That's why it's great!

312
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,340
I lost. You really freaked me out.

313
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,550
But I'll gladly declare my defeat.

314
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,470
Because, now that I'm a
thin piece of paper,

315
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,550
I can stick my hand inside the shredder!

316
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,250
What did you just pull out?!

317
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,020
Don't you dare open up that piece of paper!

318
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:57,420
I'll gladly turn into a piece of paper.

319
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,100
Josuke Higashikata

320
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,920
Koichi Hirose

321
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,050
Yuya Fungami... You're...

322
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,330
actually sorta cool, after all.

323
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,040
Josuke Higashikata... Koichi Hirose...

324
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,430
S-Stay back, Josuke! Look at this paper!

325
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,470
I-I'll rip it!

326
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,360
Yuya Fungami is in this piece of paper!

327
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,190
Act 3! 3 Freeze!

328
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,570
S-So heavy...

329
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,010
Let's see, what was it?

330
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,200
There was something that I was
supposed to remember about you...

331
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,440
Oh, that's right. I remember.

332
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,430
I said that I would kill you.

333
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,330
That's right... I definitely said that.

334
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,770
I said I would never forgive
guys like you, right?

335
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,940
Guys like you

336
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,230
who take hostages and try to
threaten people emotionally...

337
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,280
W-Wait a minute!

338
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,470
I just liked observing other
people getting scared!

339
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,060
I just recently got this Stand, so I got cocky.

340
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,190
I-I apologize. I feel really bad.

341
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,820
There's something I realized
after watching you...

342
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,900
Huh?

343
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,910
You have a habit of closing one eye
when you get scared, don't you?

344
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,430
That's a habit, right?

345
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,320
But...

346
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,350
When you're even more scared, you close both.

347
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,390
You like observing? Then keep doing it.

348
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,980
Quietly and calmly keep observing.

349
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,270
I-I'm a book...

350
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,180
The Misterioso boy, Terunosuke Miyamoto,

351
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,650
became a book and is thus unable to fight.

352
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,380
Josuke didn't read the contents of the book,

353
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,640
but the book is at Morioh Library.

354
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
If you give the staff the title "Misterioso,"

355
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,520
they'll bring it for you,
though you can't take it home.

356
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,870
When reading this book, you sometimes
feel like you can hear a voice.

357
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,880
Well, that's that.

358
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,870
Morioh
Library

359
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,780
Or probably not at all.

360
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,140
Maybe this means that we're
getting closer to Yoshikage Kira.

361
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,760
Though we don't know anything.

362
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,200
Curses... Those resilient bastards!

363
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,690
July 15th (Thurs)  4:10 PM

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,490
It's no use calling for help.

365
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,490
Hurry up and burn the pictures, okay?

366
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,280
July 15th (Thurs)  4:30 PM

367
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,180
All right, I'm heading out for a bit.

368
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,330
Where are you going?

369
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,240
To find out what he's
going to do even quicker,

370
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
I'll check out the surroundings
of the missing people listed here.

371
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,010
People cannot escape the fate
into which they were born.

372
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,260
He'll definitely make his move.

373
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,720
July 15th (Thurs)  4:52 PM

374
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm going to film it...

375
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,270
I'll film the proof that Dad isn't Dad.

376
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,950
No matter what.
