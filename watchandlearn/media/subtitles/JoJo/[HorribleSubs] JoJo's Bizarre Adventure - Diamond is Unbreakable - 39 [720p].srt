2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,360
...is nothing compared to the heart
of justice that's here right now!

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,860
It's definitely here!
It's right here for sure!

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,860
Compared to that heart, you're nothing!

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,580
Th-This is a dream...

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,290
This... is a dream.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,890
The idea that I'm being cornered like this...

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,420
This has to be a dream.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,430
You don't have...

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,180
...anywhere left to run.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,970
You're finished.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,510
J-Josuke's badly hurt...

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,610
The battle had already begun
while we were waiting.

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,960
Which means...

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,820
That's Yoshikage Kira.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,740
Someone's hurt over there!

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,360
Get back! There's a chance of
an explosion from a gas leak!

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,360
Bring the ambulance over here!

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,950
Bring the stretcher!

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,580
It's dangerous, so please get back!

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,370
Are you all right?

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,570
Just get back!

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,020
Can you hear me?
An ambulance is on its way.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,120
You're going to be all right.

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,370
Don't let that lady near Kira!

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,170
We'll get you treated at
the hospital right away.

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,640
Please, hang in there.

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,260
It'll be okay. Hang in there.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,800
O-Oh, no!

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,560
That lady's been turned into a bomb!

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,310
Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,400
Jotaro, we need your Star Platinum.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,630
I know.

36
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,900
But it's no use unless I can get closer.

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,660
Even if I stop time, we're too far away,

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,780
and I can't do anything to him.

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,910
I have to get at least five meters closer.

40
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,120
You turned someone into a
bomb and took them hostage?

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,350
Just try it! I'll fix her right up in a heartbeat!

42
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,010
No! It's not as simple as taking a hostage!

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,970
He's got a hidden ability!

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,350
It's an ability called Bites the Dust,
and it can blow away time!

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,840
Episode 39    Goodbye, Morioh – The Heart of Gold

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,730
It must only work on people who aren't
Stand users, like me or that lady,

47
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,740
and occurs coincidentally
whenever Kira is in trouble.

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,840
Which means, when he's in despair
like this, this ability activates

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,770
and becomes a bomb that can
turn back time one hour!

50
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,620
What the hell?

51
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,370
The knuckles and skin on
your hand are so soft...

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,260
You have such cute, white fingers...

53
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,920
Will you rub my cheek?

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Huh?

55
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,010
Rubbing my cheek calms me down so much...

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,620
When I was a child...

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,390
You've heard of Leonardo da
Vinci's Mona Lisa, right?

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,660
When I saw that painting in an art book...

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,930
When I first saw that,

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,440
I don't know how to put it...

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,060
Um, this is a bit dirty, but...

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
Everything About
Leonardo da Vinci's
World

63
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,660
I got an erection.

64
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,520
I just cut out the part with her hands

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,820
and hung it in my room for a while.

66
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,330
I want to cut off yours, too.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,260
What are you doing?!

68
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,370
My name is Yoshikage Kira!

69
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,020
I've killed 48 women with
beautiful hands up to now.

70
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,620
You're the only one!

71
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,270
You're the only one who
will know my identity!

72
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,150
O-Oh, no! Bites the Dust is about to start!

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,140
If we don't defeat him now,

74
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,000
everyone here but that
lady will be blown away!

75
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,750
Jotaro!

76
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,830
Are you coming for me, Jotaro?

77
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,460
Bites the Dust was created because
I didn't want to run into you!

78
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,780
Come closer! Just try and stop time!

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,370
How long will you be able to stop it?

80
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,720
Just try to corner me more!

81
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,690
Pushing me to the limit again will
make Bites the Dust appear!

82
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,330
Jotaro, stop time!

83
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,070
Don't let him push Killer Queen's switch!

84
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,740
Wh-What?

85
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,510
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,430
Now!

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,070
I-I did it! It activated!

88
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,330
I was able to return!

89
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,210
It went into effect.

90
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,710
I was able to have Bites
the Dust take effect again!

91
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,980
I beat them!

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,150
Now I can be free!

93
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,950
What was that just now?

94
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,120
The birds came from behind me and...

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,380
What just happened?

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,330
Come to think of it, this isn't
the way I usually take to work...

97
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,980
But if Bites the Dust did
turn back time one hour,

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,990
I should be on my way to work now...

99
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,530
What time is it right now?

100
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,080
That's right. I had put my
watch in my chest pocket.

101
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,790
This is...

102
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,790
Why is it broken?!

103
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,550
It's 8:29! Bites the Dust
did go into effect again!

104
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,180
The watch that Hayato broke with Stray Cat
should have returned to normal, too!

105
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,850
Haven't you realized it?

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,440
So the Kosaku Kawajiri that Rohan took
a picture of was Yoshikage Kira...

107
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,220
And it's finally over, isn't it?

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,080
They finally cornered you, Yoshikage Kira.

109
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,300
Who are you?

110
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,330
You don't remember me?

111
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, I guess that's no surprise.

112
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,130
It happened fifteen years ago.

113
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,220
Something very traumatic must have happened.

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,510
Something so traumatic that you don't
even realize what happened to you.

115
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,880
Are you a new Stand user?!

116
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,310
I'll make you realize
that you're already dead!

117
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,980
What?

118
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,310
This isn't any Stand ability!

119
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,780
This is proof that all that's here is the
completely black soul of a dead killer!

120
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,770
Well? Do you remember how you died now?

121
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,130
Even if I stop time right now,
I'm too far away from him.

122
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,880
Don't let him push the switch!

123
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,070
No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

124
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,880
Now!

125
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,350
Act Three! 3 Freeze!
He's now within five meters!

126
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,780
S-h-i-t!

127
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,160
You rotten pieces of shit!

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,410
Star Platinum! The World!

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,880
Koichi, you truly are a reliable guy.

130
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm truly thankful that I came
to this town and met you.

131
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,720
And...

132
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,700
Good grief.

133
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,530
I made it in time.

134
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,750
Time has begun to move again.

135
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,740
Crush

136
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,960
H-He did it!

137
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,550
He made it in time!

138
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,630
I'll push it... I'm gonna push it...

139
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,820
Bites the Dust will go into effect again...

140
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,690
H-How? He just suddenly went flying back!

141
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,410
I'm gonna push it... I-I'm gonna push it...

142
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,790
I'm gonna push the switch right now...

143
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,370
I know he's our enemy,
but he really is something.

144
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,300
Hey, stop!

145
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,610
Stop!

146
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,910
Morioh Fire Department

147
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,620
Someone's on the ground back here!

148
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,880
What?!

149
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,940
O-Oh, no! A guy's been
run over by an ambulance!

150
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,610
I didn't realize he was there!

151
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,710
Drive back forward! Forward!

152
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,520
You there! Get outside of the tape!

153
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,610
Get back! Please hurry and get back!

154
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,410
Are you one of the injured, too?

155
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,040
It's no use. He's dead. He died instantly.

156
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,750
He's dead?

157
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,650
It was like he dove under there himself.

158
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,470
This is my responsibility.

159
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm not trying to make excuses, but I
didn't have a chance to restrain him.

160
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
This is unbelievable.

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,410
His head was caught between
the tire and the road...

162
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,660
The skin on his face has been ripped off.

163
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,270
Pardon me.

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,020
Do you happen to know the
identity of the deceased?

165
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,780
He said that his name was Yoshikage Kira.

166
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,210
Kira...

167
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,420
There's a family by the name of Kira
in Kotodai that goes back generations.

168
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,580
I heard its only current member lives alone,
so he might not have any family...

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,580
An accident... His demise was
due to an accidental death.

170
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,590
But this is how it should be.

171
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,780
There would be no way to punish him in court.

172
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,340
This was the best outcome.

173
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,100
I... didn't actually get along
with my dad that well...

174
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,300
But my dad was murdered by him.

175
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,100
I wanted him punished.

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,340
I wanted someone to punish him.

177
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,970
It looks like you remember, Yoshikage Kira...

178
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,000
The exact way you died.

179
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,330
It looks like you remember now!

180
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,830
Just what are you?! Who the hell are you?!

181
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,000
Fifteen years ago, you didn't
have a Stand ability,

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,820
so you couldn't make corpses disappear.

183
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,590
That's why, when I died,
it was in all the papers.

184
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,360
Do you remember this wound on my back?

185
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,350
Or, since it was your first murder,
you forgot to take my hand,

186
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,230
so perhaps I wasn't as memorable?!

187
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,980
It's you...

188
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,240
I believe your name was Reimi Sugimoto...

189
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,570
What the hell have you been
doing here for fifteen years?!

190
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,400
Wait...

191
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,430
Why would you go to the
trouble of showing me

192
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,240
the wound on your back and
telling me who you are?

193
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,530
This wouldn't be the place where you're
not supposed to turn around, is it?

194
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,750
My father told me that there was a road in
this town where spirits of the dead walk,

195
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,590
and if you were to find yourself there,
you must not turn around.

196
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,550
If you were to turn around,
an uncontrollable power

197
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,300
would drag you off somewhere.

198
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,680
You weren't showing me

199
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,670
the wound on your back so
I'd end up in front of you,

200
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,530
forcing me to turn around, were you?

201
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,910
You weren't trying to trick me, were you?

202
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,310
Let's have you turn around.

203
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,970
I'd like to see what would happen.

204
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,010
Come on! Turn around!

205
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,260
You will turn around!

206
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,820
Did you really think

207
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,850
that I didn't expect you to try to do this to me?

208
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,750
We've been waiting fifteen
years for you to come here...

209
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,350
"We"?

210
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,060
Arnold!

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,200
What?!

212
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,780
Now, let's have you punished, Yoshikage Kira.

213
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,330
What? What are these things?!

214
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,830
Deadly Queen!

215
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,160
Make these things explode!

216
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,130
I-I...

217
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,930
Wh-Where are they going to take me?

218
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,260
Who knows?

219
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,390
But...

220
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,540
I'm sure it's somewhere you
won't be able to rest in peace.

221
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,710
Now,

222
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,460
we can finally...

223
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,810
We can finally go...

224
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,020
Help Wanted

225
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,020
Reimi! Are you really leaving?

226
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,020
It wouldn't hurt if you stayed
a little longer, would it?

227
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,860
It feels like this town's
losing its guardian angel...

228
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,610
It makes me uneasy,
knowing that you're leaving.

229
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,910
Thanks... But there's nothing
left for us to do in this town.

230
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,590
The time has come for us to leave this town.

231
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,270
We have to go.

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,080
Or what? Are you going to cry when I leave

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,050
because you'll miss me, Rohan?

234
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,540
Don't be stupid.

235
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:13,550
Kisara
Drugs

236
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,930
Why would I miss you?

237
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,340
You already died fifteen years ago.

238
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,320
I said this before, but I still
believe that ghosts should give up

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,020
whatever attachments they have left
here, and just hurry up and pass on.

240
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,880
Oh, fine! Since this is the
last time, I'll be honest!

241
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,820
I will miss you!

242
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,440
Of course I don't want you to go!

243
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,790
Hey.

244
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,290
Josuke! Everyone!

245
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,710
So it's finally over, Reimi.

246
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,730
Yukako! Hazamada, and everyone else!

247
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,470
We came to see you off.

248
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,050
Everyone...

249
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,710
I know it's strange to say this
to a dead person, but take care.

250
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,810
I'm going to miss you, too.

251
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,480
You're a wonderful young lady.

252
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,880
Reimi! Thank you for everything!

253
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,820
Because of you, this town was saved!

254
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,650
Thanks, Koichi.

255
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,250
But I believe we all saved Morioh together.

256
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,130
I'm sure that no one here
will ever forget you.

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,290
Thank you, everyone.

258
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,640
Goodbye, everyone.

259
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,930
Goodbye, Reimi.

260
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,430
Goodbye...

261
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,660
He's awfully late tonight...

262
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,960
I wonder if he had to work overtime.

263
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,160
He could call, at least...

264
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,420
Oh, Hayato.

265
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,740
You go on and eat before it gets cold.

266
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,300
I'll eat when your father gets home.

267
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,360
Hayato?

268
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,310
I'll wait, too...

269
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,920
I'll eat with you

270
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,350
when Dad gets home, too...

271
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,690
You sure?

272
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,770
By the way, have you gotten
a little taller lately?

273
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,420
Our town, Morioh, was deeply hurt.

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,290
The town was hurt by the
monster named Yoshikage Kira

275
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,420
that this town itself had created.

276
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm sure that Hayato's mom

277
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,010
will forever be waiting
for her husband to return.

278
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,390
Shigechi's parents will forever
be waiting for him to return.

279
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,450
The families of the daughters and
sisters killed by Yoshikage Kira

280
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,140
will forever be waiting for their return.

281
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,880
The pain of their wounds
will now only get deeper.

282
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,610
How can we try to ease this pain?

283
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,150
Will it be life-threatening for this town's
future, or will it eventually disappear?

284
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,050
I have no idea.

285
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,230
Are you worried, Jotaro?

286
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,220
About leaving this town?

287
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,050
Yeah, a little.

288
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,780
After watching Josuke and the others
get involved in this incident in Morioh,

289
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,800
there's one thing that I can say...

290
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,430
That the young people in
this town have hearts of gold.

291
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,430
The same hearts of gold shining with justice

292
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,460
that we saw when we headed to Egypt.

293
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,000
I saw that within Josuke and the others...

294
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
As long as they have that, they'll be fine.

295
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,780
We won't have to worry
about this town any longer.

296
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,910
Hey, Old Man!

297
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,540
Can't you hear me, Old Man?

298
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,510
Now, then... I guess I should say
goodbye to the son I'm so proud of.

299
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,880
The picture of my mom
that I just gave you...

300
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,660
You still got it?

301
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,360
Yes. I put it in my wallet,
just as you asked.

302
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,350
I'm leaving without seeing your mother,
but I wish her nothing but happiness.

303
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,200
Ah... So you put it in your wallet...

304
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,650
This is the edge of that picture.

305
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,110
Shining Diamond!

306
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,370
I'll be taking this!

307
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,960
A dad should give his son an allowance, right?

308
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,540
Not to mention, if you take
that picture back home,

309
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,470
your old lady's gonna get mad at you again!

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,470
Y-You little brat...

311
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,930
You gonna take back what you said about
him having a heart of gold, old man?

312
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,430
Take care!

313
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,690
The invisible baby's
mother was never found,

314
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,900
and the baby ended up being
adopted by Joseph Joestar.

315
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,840
Jotaro Kujo got his doctorate
from a thesis he wrote

316
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,660
while he was here about a
starfish he saw on the beach.

317
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,950
Josuke, that jerk!

318
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,960
He ate the snack I was
saving for myself again!

319
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,170
Ugh!

320
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,040
I'm gonna drink his juice.

321
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,130
Koichi!

322
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,510
Sorry!

323
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,080
I was late because I was making us lunch.

324
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,100
Huh? You made us lunch? Thanks!

325
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,040
I can't wait to eat it.

326
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,280
So good!

327
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,950
Whew

328
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,710
Oh, here it comes! Yeah! That intensity!

329
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,790
You might be able to turn
back to normal, Dad!

330
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,880
Well, whatever.

331
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,950
My skin is so soft!

332
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,300
My eyes feel so refreshed!

333
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,410
The food here was amazing!

334
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,360
Right? Even I look so much more
beautiful that I don't know what

335
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,010
I'm going to do with myself.

336
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,940
You're shining, Yu.

337
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,490
So shiny!

338
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,940
You think so?

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,320
I'm shiny, eh?

340
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,840
Grazie!

341
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,820
I look forward to your next visit.

342
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,280
I just saw Ko holding hands
with a really pretty girl!

343
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,290
Huh? What does that mean?
He hasn't told me anything!

344
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,150
Did you hear about
Mr. Kira who went missing?

345
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,350
I did! You mean how he turned
up as a faceless corpse, right?

346
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,470
That's so scary...

347
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,280
What are you gonna do about it?

348
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,300
Wha?

349
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm telling you that juice
sprayed out from the can

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,500
you kicked and got all over my manga!

351
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,310
That's not my problem!

352
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,890
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

353
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,000
All right. Warm-up exercises done.

354
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,270
Shonen Jump

355
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,270
Thanks for waiting!
Serialization Returns!

356
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,510
Is it really so interesting to
look at the town all the time?

357
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,590
Nothing ever changes.

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,400
It is.

359
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,240
This town is very interesting.

360
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:03,940
And so, for most people, the summer
of 1999 passed like any other summer.

361
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,320
Hey, did you hear?

362
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,360
Apparently, Rohan was caught
shoplifting at Kame Yu.

363
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,320
What?!

364
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,360
That's insane if it's true.

365
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,300
Yeah, but I'm not really sure.

366
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,460
You aren't even sure?

367
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,760
Jeez... Well, let's go.

368
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,980
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

369
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,980
Diamond is Unbreakable

370
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,980
End
