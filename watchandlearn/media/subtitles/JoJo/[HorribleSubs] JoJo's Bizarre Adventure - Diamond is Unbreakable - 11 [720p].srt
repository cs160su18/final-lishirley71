00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,250
Josuke, how long are you
going to be playing that?

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,400
If you don't turn off that video game now,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,890
I'm gonna shut it off myself.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,230
Just five more minutes! Please!

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,400
Just let me play for five more minutes!

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,490
This is the most exciting part!

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,080
If I stop right now,

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,940
I'll be a man who couldn't accomplish
the one thing he set out to do,

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,160
Come on! If you don't quit,

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,160
and I'll regret it the rest of my life!

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,870
Do you really want your son
to end up like that, Mom?!

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,870
the kicks are just going to get harder!

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,790
How long can you put up with this?

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,050
I-It's over...

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,060
D'oh.

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,250
Now, put that away and do your homework.

18
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,050
And take off your damn
uniform when you're at home.

19
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,220
It's nighttime!

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,320
I won't be able to see you anymore.

21
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,180
Why, Sachiko? Don't you love me?

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,390
Weird. I thought I turned it off.

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,330
That's not it. I'm thinking about leaving town.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,200
And you want to forget about me?

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,860
Huh? It won't turn off.

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,040
Looks like Jotaro Kujo's not leaving town...

27
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,030
Even though I warned him all those times.

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,630
Well, what's the deal, Josuke Higashikata?

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,330
You're...

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,700
Chili Pepper?!

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,410
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,410
Diamond is Unbreakable

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,250
Episode 11  Chili Pepper, Part 1

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,260
Why'd you come here?

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,520
Don't ask that now.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,560
I've been stopping by here every
now and then for a while now.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,530
What?

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,890
So this bastard's been
watching me for a long time?

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,350
I've been frequently going to visit Okuyasu,

40
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,840
the younger brother of Keicho,
whom I got rid of,

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,240
and I'm very familiar with Koichi Hirose's
Reverb and Yukako Yamagishi, as well.

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,010
And I know that Toshikazu Hazamada

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,160
and Tamami Kobayashi are
both in the hospital.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,720
What I'm asking you is what are you
actually doing in front of me,

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,630
when all this time you've been
sneaking around like a gutless coward?

46
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,430
I doubt this is it,

47
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,510
but you're not dumb enough to actually
think you're going to kick my ass, are you?

48
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,140
Kick your ass?

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,100
I'd never do anything that awful to you.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm here to kill you painlessly.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,610
I just can't laugh at your
sad excuse for a joke,

52
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,260
good sir.

53
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,870
I told Jotaro this before, but Jotaro's
Star Platinum is a menace to me.

54
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,070
It's the fact that Jotaro is too attentive

55
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,750
and the fact that Star Platinum
has the power to stop time.

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:58,000
So I just wanted to see just how much
stronger my Stand has gotten over time.

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,150
Before I fight Jotaro,

58
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,640
I thought I'd test myself
against you, Josuke Higashikata.

59
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,850
Come a bit closer.

60
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:15,180
Closer! Until you can attack as quickly
and precisely as Star Platinum, Josuke!

61
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,990
Come on! If you're that far away,
your punches will be too weak.

62
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,730
Are you mocking me?

63
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,470
Of course not.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,390
I've just seen through your abilities.

65
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,830
Come closer and give me a super sharp one.

66
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,960
Here. Hit me right here.
Come on. Come closer!

67
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,370
Crack!

68
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,210
Huh? H-He's fast...

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,650
Quit your daydreaming!

70
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,970
Much faster than I thought!

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,970
If you want to keep daydreaming,

72
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,070
maybe I'll just help you sleep!

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,270
Listen up! Jotaro's Star
Platinum is nothing like this!

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,810
I regret my actions.

75
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,650
I got a little cocky and underestimated him.

76
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,530
What?!

77
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,670
Josuke! What the hell is all that noise?

78
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,650
What was that Stand power?
It felt like a jet engine going off...

79
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,800
He might just be stronger than Jotaro...

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,100
You, too, Josuke.

81
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,600
Your Shining Diamond surprised me.

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,730
Looks like I'm not the only one that's grown.

83
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,410
I'll wait a little longer.

84
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,990
Until my Chili Pepper grows stronger,
I won't be able to defeat Jotaro.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,570
He can show up anywhere there's electricity.

86
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,710
Not only does he have tremendous power,
but he can control his Stand remotely.

87
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,300
Josuke, I just asked you
what all that noise was!

88
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,750
It's nothing.

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,430
Man, a bug totally just bit me.

90
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,160
Damn it! Bugs only come to me.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,980
Ah, Josuke!

92
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,060
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

93
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,620
What did you want to talk about, Josuke?

94
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,050
Why call us out to a
lonely-looking place like this?

95
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,070
Couldn't we go to Tonio's or the usual café?

96
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,710
I'm not the one who called you
guys out here. It was Jotaro.

97
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,080
Jotaro did? I wonder what he wants.

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,300
It's probably about Chili Pepper.

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,270
What?! Chili Pepper?

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,050
You mean the Stand, Chili Pepper?!

101
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,790
So he appeared?

102
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,510
Yeah, he did. At my place last night.

103
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,680
You bastard! Why didn't you
let me know right away?!

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,800
Okuyasu... He acts completely different
when it comes to Chili Pepper.

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I can't blame him, since that
Stand killed his brother, but...

106
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,610
I told Josuke to keep quiet.

107
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,670
Talking about him in the city, where
there's electricity running, is dangerous.

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,380
Jotaro!

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,960
I had you all come to this field
so he wouldn't hear us talking.

110
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,340
Okuyasu, Chili Pepper
totally pisses me off, too.

111
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,050
He got into my house without me knowing.

112
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,740
He's free to listen to us talking
and take whatever he wants.

113
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,330
Come to think of it, the homework I finished

114
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,930
the other day disappeared from my desk!

115
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,830
And I thought my mom mistook it for trash—

116
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,070
That's not a big deal, Koichi!

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,240
What I'm trying to say is that the only reason

118
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,230
Chili Pepper hasn't caused more
trouble is that we're around,

119
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,330
and he drags people who piss
him off into the phone lines

120
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,600
with about as much effort as
someone making a pervy phone call.

121
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,780
Of course, he can use the bow and arrow,

122
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,540
and he may have already used it on someone.

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,130
I saw first-hand that he's gotten stronger.

124
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,270
We have to hurry up and
find out who his user is.

125
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,050
B-But how?

126
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,870
We all gathered here to figure
that out, right, Jotaro?

127
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,640
No, not quite.

128
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,810
We'll be able to find him.

129
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,390
Because the person who's capable

130
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,660
of finding him is arriving
at Morioh Port at noon.

131
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,490
Huh?

132
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,860
Someone who can find him?

133
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Is he a Stand user?!

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
That's right.

135
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,560
His Stand's name is Hermit Purple.

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,870
Only he's gotten way too old, so he
doesn't have the strength to fight.

137
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,770
Too old? How old is this guy?

138
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,750
Do you know him, Jotaro?

139
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,530
Yeah. I know him very well.

140
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,300
He used to be pretty ripped,

141
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,270
though you wouldn't guess that now.

142
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,760
He's 80... No, maybe he's 79...

143
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,900
79?! He's super old!

144
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,270
Well, his legs are weak,
so he's using a cane.

145
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,160
He had surgery to remove
gallstones two years ago,

146
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,800
and suffered from cataracts.

147
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,140
He wears full dentures

148
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,900
and complains that he can't eat T-bone steaks.

149
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,160
He's also starting to forget things.

150
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,570
Hey, come on, now.

151
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,180
You're not gonna tell me his hobby
is talking to mailboxes, are you?

152
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,660
Give me a break!

153
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,790
I had you guys gather here in
order to protect that old man.

154
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,940
If Chili Pepper finds out about him,
he's probably going to kill him.

155
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,390
Because the thing Chili Pepper fears
most is us finding out who his user is.

156
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,850
Yeah, but is a geezer like that
really going to be useful to us?

157
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,680
I tried to stop him,

158
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,930
but when he heard about the bow and
arrow, he came to Japan on his own.

159
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,860
Came to Japan? Is he a foreigner, Jotaro?

160
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,450
Yeah.

161
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,160
Josuke, th-this is serious!

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Huh? What is?

163
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,660
Josuke! If he's 79, a foreigner,
and a Stand user...

164
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,400
Y-You can't mean...

165
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,260
I heard you loud and clear.

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,880
Chili Pepper!

167
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,340
Impossible! How'd he get to this field?

168
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Morioh Landmark #4
Morioh Grand Hotel
How to get there: From bus stop #1,
take the bus for "Morioh Grand
Swimming Area" and get off at the
"Morioh Grand Hotel" stop.
From there, it's a 0-minute walk.
Located in the same area as many
expensive villas, it's an elegant hotel
full of history. It has housed various
travelers to Morioh and has been
beloved for years. The beef tongue
served at the hotel restaurant is
considered superb and is
the talk of the town.

169
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,440
Rumble

170
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,450
Why?! There aren't any
electrical lines here, so how?!

171
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,850
The bike's battery.

172
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,420
Shit! He must have hidden in the
bike's battery and followed us here.

173
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,830
In my bike?

174
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,250
He heard us!

175
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,400
The port at noon?

176
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,540
An old geezer Stand user who can find me?

177
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,790
Rumble

178
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll be sure to kill that geezer the
moment he arrives at the port!

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,020
Now he knows about the old man...

180
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,050
In other words, Josuke's father.

181
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,890
Rumble

182
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,150
This isn't good.

183
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,720
If we let him go, he's gonna get
to the old man before we do.

184
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,410
Josuke! We need to throw a rock
at that bike and destroy it!

185
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,030
No, hold up.

186
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,360
For the sake of revenge, I, Okuyasu Nijimura,

187
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,870
will kill that bastard!

188
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,200
He cut through space-time!

189
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,000
Ack! Keicho's younger brother!

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,090
I'm the one who's going to deal with you.

191
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,920
I'll scrape you away!

192
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,800
Okuyasu, I compliment you,

193
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,810
at least in regards to you
instantly transferring over here.

194
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,080
But the scratching motion
you do with your The Hand

195
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,690
seems to stand no chance
against Chili Pepper's swiftness.

196
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,820
You're too slow!

197
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,940
Take a better look, you dumbass.

198
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,200
When I said I'll scrape you away,

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,330
I meant the bike.

200
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,040
The bike's front wheel!

201
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,180
Now you won't be able to run away.

202
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,550
You actually used your head,
Okuyasu. Good job!

203
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,550
Chili Pepper can't go far
from the bike's battery.

204
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,810
Which means... Look!

205
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,790
The nearest electrical line is
at least a hundred meters away,

206
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,320
so you're as good as caught!

207
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,650
That was close!

208
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,650
No, we haven't actually caught him yet.

209
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,270
The bike battery is still there.

210
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,270
I'm sure he plans to do whatever
he can to kill Okuyasu and run.

211
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,150
We're going, too!

212
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,250
Right!

213
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,130
Do you really think you've trapped me?

214
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,790
Are you trying to get revenge for Keicho?

215
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,490
No.

216
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,380
My Big Bro

217
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,220
deserved to die.

218
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,430
I knew that someone would kill him someday.

219
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,770
The thing about crimes...

220
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,480
When you keep doing stuff like that,

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
somewhere, somehow, it's going
to come back and get you.

222
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,570
Even I can figure that out.

223
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,590
If you tell me

224
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,160
your user's name and address,

225
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,330
I'll spare your life.

226
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,780
If I tell you, you'll spare my life?

227
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,130
You're calmer than I thought.

228
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
I thought your insides were boiling
from wanting revenge so badly.

229
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,390
Deep down inside, I hope you don't tell me!

230
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm dying to scrape you away
so bad, you dumbass!

231
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,690
I knew it.

232
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,620
But you want to scrape me away?

233
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,150
With that pathetically slow right hand?

234
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,840
Should I laugh, or should I yawn?

235
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,530
It's a tough choice!

236
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,280
You bastard!

237
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,410
I'll kill you!

238
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,010
I'll make sure you know well

239
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,410
just how slow your Stand is!

240
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,170
Do you see now? It's this slow!

241
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,180
Okuyasu!

242
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,430
Okuyasu!

243
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,430
Shit!

244
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,920
Here comes Jotaro...

245
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,890
I can't stick around here for long.

246
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,900
What?! He's behind me?!

247
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,490
I may have missed, but I still
scraped through space-time,

248
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,880
so I could instantly transfer.

249
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,820
Did you forget?

250
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,950
I've got you now!

251
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,700
You little shit!

252
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,960
Looks like you're getting quite a bit slower.

253
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,180
Are you going to be able
to escape the next attack?

254
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,720
Look! Chili Pepper's electrical
sparkle is fading!

255
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,970
He's getting weaker!

256
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,560
His Stand power must be running out!

257
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,060
Does this mean Okuyasu wins?

258
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,970
Okuyasu! Don't finish him off yet!

259
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,610
Wait until we get there.

260
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,060
You've won!

261
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,170
We have to ask him where the
bow and arrow are right now.

262
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,990
You're right... I'm weakening.

263
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:41,440
Your Stand's right hand is slow as hell,
but it's still a terrifying Stand.

264
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,250
But...

265
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,870
Are you sure you don't want to finish me off?

266
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,060
Maybe I'm just acting like
I've grown weak, Okuyasu.

267
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,850
What?!

268
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,310
Maybe I'm waiting for Jotaro to get
closer so I can chop his head off.

269
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,110
What the hell are you talking about?

270
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, nothing.

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,760
What will you do? Finish me off now,

272
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,260
or wait for Jotaro to get here?

273
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,030
You bastard...

274
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,910
But wait. Why would you tell me that?

275
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,620
If he hadn't told me he was acting weaker,

276
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,440
he could have tricked me, and beaten
me and Josuke by playing dirty...

277
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,720
Which means, uh, since he told me he's fine,

278
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,180
my chance of getting attacked is zero, right?

279
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,160
You're telling me to finish you off?!
Do you want to die?

280
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,930
I'll leave that up to you.

281
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,990
Is he really weaker?

282
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,320
Or is he lying about being weaker,
and he's actually fine?

283
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,230
Which is the truth?

284
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,610
Are you coming or aren't you?

285
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,420
If he's fine, I need to go in to finish him.

286
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,710
It's possible he's got
something up his sleeve, too.

287
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,000
Should I?

288
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,990
Okuyasu... Something's wrong.

289
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,550
Hurry up and make up your mind, Okuyasu.

290
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,070
Damn it!

291
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,570
I can't be bothered to think about
which is right anymore, damn it!

292
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,820
Okuyasu!

293
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,570
Don't try and stop me, Jotaro!

294
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,610
He killed my big bro!
I'm going to finish this!

295
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,780
That's the only truth inside my heart!

296
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,870
Die, you little shit!

297
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,670
Gaon

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,260
Just great. Now finding the bow
and arrow is going to be a real pain.

299
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,070
Though it looks like things were settled.

300
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,490
No, something is wrong.

301
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,260
It looks like Chili Pepper
really was plotting something.

302
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,600
Huh?!

303
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,870
There were electrical cables underground?

304
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,670
That bastard! He wanted me to dig this up!

305
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,790
I really was weakened.

306
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,180
The bike's battery is only a 12-volt.

307
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,920
That was close!

308
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,170
Why, you...

309
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,740
Thanks to you, I feel alive again!

310
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,720
Okuyasu!

311
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,580
If you had only been a good little boy

312
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,680
and held back like Jotaro told you,

313
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,720
the battery would have died,
and I would've been eliminated.

314
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,390
Wha...

315
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,560
I know where all of the
electrical lines in this city are.

316
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,800
I thought about running
away using those cables,

317
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
but they were far from the bike.

318
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,150
I didn't have the power to dig up the cables.

319
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,280
You bastard!

320
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,740
He's even more...

321
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,110
Which means the electricity from
earlier, the electrical power,

322
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,000
is on my side.

323
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,710
Bogo

324
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,060
Okuyasu!

325
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,820
Your big brother Keicho
said you held him back.

326
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,730
He was right.

327
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,450
Your mind is underdeveloped.

328
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,150
You never could have gotten
revenge, you dumbass!

329
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,810
Bye-bye, Jotaro, Josuke!

330
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,930
Joseph Joestar, was it?

331
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,810
I'll have that geezer share the
same fate as the Nijimura Brothers!

332
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,680
I've won!

333
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,960
Okuyasu!

334
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,270
He got dragged in there!

335
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,020
Okuyasu!

336
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,410
Okuyasu!

337
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,720
Good grief.

338
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,530
I can't believe we had him
cornered and he still got away.

339
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,000
He's a pretty dangerous Stand.

340
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,740
He can be controlled remotely,
and in terms of power,

341
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,040
What?! What are you guys talking about?!

342
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,040
he can take advantage of all the electrical
companies, making his power infinite.

343
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,460
Why are you analyzing the enemy's
abilities when Okuyasu just died?!

344
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,300
Oh, right. I guess we should
worry about Okuyasu.

345
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,500
Right.

346
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,670
Talk about a silver lining.

347
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,560
Looks like Okuyasu has really good luck.

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,520
Okuyasu was really lucky that
his right arm was chopped off.

349
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,180
Huh?

350
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,870
Shining Diamond!

351
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,010
When I fix his arm, it means
his body will come back.

352
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,820
Damn it!

353
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,330
Yay! Okuyasu is back!

354
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,480
Damn it... I-I...

355
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,300
I totally lost to that bastard.

356
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,890
Damn it! Damn it!

357
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,840
It's not about revenge or winning or losing.

358
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,190
We have to think about
protecting Joseph Joestar.

359
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,600
That'll lead to us defeating Chili Pepper.

360
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,960
You have to do that for everyone.

361
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,200
For the place where we live...

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,860
Jotaro, this isn't good.

363
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,190
I was taking this lightly.

364
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,070
Yeah. We have to get to the old
man's boat before Chili Pepper does.

365
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,240
Let's hurry to the port.

366
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,130
Hey, you two! Aren't you
acting a bit too cool?

367
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,640
Okuyasu's in shock!

368
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,120
If we're going to the port, this way is closer.

369
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,910
All right.

370
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,880
Hey, wait!

371
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,660
Surpass my big bro, huh...

372
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,680
You taught me a lesson, Chili Pepper.

373
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,770
Mr. Joestar.

374
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,520
We'll be arriving at Morioh
Port any moment now.
