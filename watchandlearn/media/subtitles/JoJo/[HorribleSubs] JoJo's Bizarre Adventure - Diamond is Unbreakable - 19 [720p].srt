6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,750
but you've indeed won the
third place prize, five million yen.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,460
Now, then... Here you go.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,620
This is the promissory note
for five million yen.

you'll be able to cash it in three days.

Please pay the amount stated above
in exchange for this promissory note.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,270
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,480

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,980
Now, I do have one question...

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,980
Reception Office

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,700
From which vendor did you
gentlemen purchase this ticket?

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,940
Sniff, sniff.

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,420
Wh-Which?

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,480
Wh-Why do you want to know that?

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,240
Oh, it's just a formality.

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,430
You stupid little brats.

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,850
You won five million yen? That's too fishy.

31
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,470
I'm a very capable bank associate,
and I smell something rotten here.

32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,470
Or perhaps

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,350
there's a reason you'd rather
not answer that question?

34
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,470
W-Well, of course we bought it in Morioh.

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,990
Oh? Well, that's bizarre...

36
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,110
There isn't a single lottery vendor in Morioh.

37
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,450
O-Oh, right...

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,220
It must have been when we went to S City.

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,070
We bought all kinds of things,
so I don't remember that well...

40
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,030
I-I-I-I-I-It was a while back, too...

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,570
I just realized something bizarre...

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,200
On the other side of the lottery ticket,

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,880
there's a place to write your name
and telephone number, and...

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,100
Ichiro Morishita

45
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,230
Ichiro Morishita...

46
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,700
The name written here doesn't
match any of your names.

47
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,770
N-Name?!

48
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,270
Phone number?!

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,000
That was written on the back?!

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,390
E-Er...

51
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,210
Well, well, well, well, this is truly bizarre.

52
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,970
This is your lottery ticket, isn't it?

53
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,280
Oh, yeah! Now I remember!

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,720
I wrote down my friend's number
on that instead of a memo pad!

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,310
Oh! Is that so?

56
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,810
Then how about we give
Mr. Ichiro Morishita a call?

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,570
We can also tell where

58
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,230
lottery tickets are purchased
with the serial number here.

59
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,330
If Mr. Ichiro Morishita was the
one who purchased this ticket

60
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,910
and remembers exactly where he bought it,

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,090
we'll then have to check this signature, too...

62
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,920
To see who this ticket belongs to.

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,430
Depending on the situation, we may
have to turn it over to the police.

64
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,640
The police?!

65
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,140
Hello? This is Morishita.

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,320
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Budogaoka Bank.

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,480
I wanted to inquire if Mr. Ichiro Morishita

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,160
had purchased the Great
Year-End Lottery ticket.

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,330
Oh, I'm Ichiro Morishita,
and yes, I bought one.

70
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah, I'm sure I bought one.

71
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,690
Yes! You stupid little brats!

72
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,170
My sense of smell was correct!

73
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:28,410
There's no way God would grant
brats like you the winning ticket!

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,020
Morishita

75
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,500
So you did! You bought a lottery ticket.

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,420
Yeah, I did.

77
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,050
Morishita Ichiro

78
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,530
But I bought like, ten, and
none of them were winners.

79
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm going to change just part of the signature...

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,270
Kinoshita Ichiro

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,540
You see, Mr. Kinoshita, your lottery ticket...

82
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,520
Kinoshita? My name's Morishita.

83
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,370
Huh? But it said "Mori"!
What? How strange...

84
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,900
Your phone number is 1771-1281,
correct, Mr. Kinoshita?

85
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,460
I told you my name's not
Kinoshita, you dumbass!

86
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,810
It's Morishita!

87
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,650
Why are you wasting my time with this?

88
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,270
I threw them all away.

89
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,350
Why don't you sell some
winning tickets sometime?

90
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,810
P-Pardon me...

91
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,610
J-Just wait, you!

92
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,120
The number you are trying to
reach is currently not in use.

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,730
Please confirm the number and try again...

94
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,220
A-Are you satisfied?

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,470
I-I-I'm terribly sorry for my rudeness.

96
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,550
Yay! It's my money!

97
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,630
I won this five million yen!

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,670
Hey, you promised that half
of it would be ours, Shigechi!

99
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,900
Did I say that?

100
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,620
You're doing that again?!

101
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,400
Hey, Josuke! Why are you stopping me?!

102
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,710
You're not gonna let him get
away with it again, are you?

103
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,830
No... This time, I'm not backing down, either!

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,490
There's no way you're getting away with this!

105
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,410
Well said, Josuke!

106
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,550
Of course you wouldn't back down!

107
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,840
It's only logical!

108
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,110
So now you don't want to
split the money, Shigechi?

109
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,550
You realize this amount is way too
much for that to fly, don't you?

110
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,520
Here.

111
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,020
This should be enough for you guys.

112
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,000
You didn't really do anything, after all.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,570
I'll take pity on you
because you're my friends.

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,930
Crush

115
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,110
Why, you—

116
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,330
Hey, Okuyasu!

117
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,610
Give us the money, you dumbass!

118
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,790
You promised us half,
so you're going to give us half!

119
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,700
Stop being greedy, you idiot!

120
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,270
You're always so quick to hit. Don't be rash.

121
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,230
When dumbasses don't get what you're saying,
this is how you make them understand!

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,300
Are you hurt?

123
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm sorry Okuyasu suddenly hit you.

124
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,160
But, Shigechi, let's not cause any trouble.

125
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,810
We're gonna hold onto the promissory
note for the five million.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,810
In three days, when it becomes cash,

127
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,070
let's split it evenly in half, like we discussed.

128
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,410
But, man, he's ridiculous.

129
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,650
I'm done hanging out with him.

130
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,950
But you know,

131
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,010
I think we should reflect on the fact
that we thought about using him

132
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,500
to get some pocket money, too.

133
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,580
You dummy.

134
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,420
Huh?

135
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,580
I'm not gonna think of it like that.

136
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,680
The only reason he was able to get
the five million was because of us.

137
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,850
If it was him alone, he could only
get maybe tens of thousands.

138
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,330
But he's getting 2.5 million on his own.

139
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,190
2.5 million!

140
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,780
yes, yes, yes, yes!

142
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,950
Like I'll give it to you.

143
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,310
Like I'll give it to you!

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,100
I heard everything, damn it!

145
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,540
I won't give you guys even one yen!

146
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,010
We got that five million
because of my Harvest!

147
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,210
You're no match for my Harvest!

148
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,670
You wanna see proof?

149
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,650
You want to see some solid proof?

150
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,640
I'll show you!

151
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,460
Ow!

152
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,050
Bastard!

153
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,610
No! The promissory note for the five million!

154
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,360
You're underestimating us, you little punk!

155
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,200
If you keep chasing me,

156
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
I'll kill you.

157
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,510
Shigechi...

158
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,710
You're gonna kill us, you backstabbing bastard?

159
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,810
You'd better be prepared to die if you're
gonna bring out your Stand against us!

160
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,530
W-Wait, Josuke...

161
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,550
What's wrong?

162
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,730
What's this sensation?

163
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,360
M-My legs...

164
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
are itching really bad.

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,350
Itching? At a time like this?

166
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,070
They itch really bad!

167
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,060
My whole body itches!

168
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,540
Wh-What is this?!

169
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,730
Lift up your pants, Okuyasu! Hurry!

170
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,200
What?!

171
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,410
They're inside my pants!

172
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,480
I-It's no use!

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,200
Knocking off two or three of
them won't damage him at all!

174
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,470
Damn it!

175
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,020
He's running away!

176
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,510
I-I'm starting to get really pissed off.

177
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,600
I've already been super pissed off!

178
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,450
We're not letting you get away, five million!

179
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,910
Now he's totally made enemies
of the Okuyasu-Josuke duo!

180
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,320
Shi

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,410
Shin

182
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:23,490
Shinin

183
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:23,570
Shining

184
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:23,700
Shining D

185
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:23,780
Shining Di

186
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:23,870
Shining Dia

187
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,950
Shining Diamo

188
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,030
Shining Diamon

189
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,990
Shining Diamond

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:24,700
Jo

191
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:24,830
Josuke

192
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:24,950
Josuke Higashi

193
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,990
Josuke Higashikata

194
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,290
Damn it! How dare he make a
fool of the great Okuyasu?!

195
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,810
I'm gonna beat him to death!

196
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,050
He must be really dumb to be greedy enough

197
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,630
to take the whole five million.

198
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,340
You stupid fatty!

199
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,430
You think you can run with a body like that?!

200
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,850
See? That's what you get, moron!

201
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,690
H-He keeps summoning Harvests under
him like a caterpillar track,

202
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,690
or like a bucket relay!

203
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,370
What the hell? He's ridiculously fast!

204
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,140
He may be a simpleton, but he's pretty clever.

205
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,220
Are they like his natural instincts?

206
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,870
Crap! We're gonna lose him!

207
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,330
Calm down.

208
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,800
We just need to

209
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,310
have our Stands lift our bodies in
the same way he is, and climb up!

210
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,970
I get it!

211
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,110
My five million...

212
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,910
You actually think you can
get away from us, Shigechi?

213
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,530
Bring it on!

214
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,790
I'll carefully pop your Harvests, one by one!

215
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,240
My Harvest is amazing.

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,590
It'll gather anything!

217
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,390
Even screws holding pipes together.

218
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,900
Even bolts!

219
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,230
If you want to talk about amazing,
there's also my Shining Diamond!

220
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,270
Heya.

221
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm still super pissed off, but right now,
I'm still willing to forgive you.

222
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,290
I'll just hit you two or three times!

223
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,740
Come on, give us the promissory note
for the five million, Shigechi.

224
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,370
I told you...

225
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,080
If you came after me,

226
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,560
I'd kill you.

227
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,810
Wh-What?

228
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,140
My hands...

229
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,150
That hurt...

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,240
I can't stand! Okuyasu, be careful!

231
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
He did something to me!

232
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,890
O-Okuyasu, you too?

233
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,360
You still haven't figured it out?

234
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,590
You guys are drunk!

235
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,380
A-Alcohol?!

236
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,500
Liquor

237
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,660
My harvest gathers anything!

238
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,550
It brought some alcohol
from the liquor store earlier,

239
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,810
then injected it into your bodies!

240
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,530
Right into your veins!

241
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,960
Wh-What?!

242
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,990
You bastard!

243
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,720
When you inject alcohol into your veins,

244
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,780
even a tiny amount will get you really drunk!

245
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,420
C-Come to think of it,

246
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,830
I've heard that alcohol is in the
same group as anesthetics...

247
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,780
Th-That bastard... m-might be pretty smart...

248
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,990
Or it might be his natural instincts.

249
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,550
I-I'm gonna murder him!

250
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,340
There's no way we're gonna lose
just because we're drunk!

251
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,640
M-My eye!

252
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,430
Josuke, hurry and fix it!

253
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,570
W-Wait, Okuyasu!

254
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,180
You guys had the nerve to

255
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,070
call me unreasonable and other
things earlier, didn't you?

256
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll show you what happens
when you underestimate me!

257
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,450
D-Damn it!

258
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,370
You have the nerve to get cocky after
you're the one who broke your promise?

259
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,480
I'm seriously going to get pissed off!

260
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,960
There's no telling what I'll do then!

261
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,300
Shut your stupid mouth, Josuke!

262
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,260
Your Stands' powers are nothing!

263
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,300
You guys are useless!

264
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,060
Make demands once you have
even half of Harvest's power!

265
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,900
Josuke, close your eyes!

266
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,040
Josuke!

267
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,740
Damn, so close!

268
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,720
But it's no use closing your eyes.

269
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,530
Harvest can get anything!

270
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,800
It can rip off your eyelids
and pry out your eyeballs!

271
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,990
All right, Shigechi, stop!

272
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,440
Forgive us already! It was all our fault.

273
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,420
Oh? You're apologizing?

274
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,610
Damn it, you little punk!

275
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,770
Oh? Okuyasu, it doesn't seem
like Josuke feels that way.

276
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,960
I-I'll give him a talking-to!

277
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,640
Just let us off the hook with this!

278
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,040
This is the 10,000 yen you gave
me and the rest of my money.

279
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,890
Let us off the hook with this.

280
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,870
Who's going to fix my eye if Josuke gets killed?

281
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,370
O-Okuyasu...

282
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,890
Oh, yeah! I just remembered!

283
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,500
I felt really bad for you guys,
and gave you more than 10,000 yen!

284
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,030
Here, take this, and please forgive us.

285
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,140
I get it, Okuyasu!

286
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,470
Just like baiting a tanuki
with food and catching it,

287
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,500
you're trying to lure him
over with cash to defeat him!

288
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,820
I totally got what you're thinking!

289
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,110
Okuyasu, being honest like that
is very favorable with me.

290
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,410
There, there.

291
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,870
Hey, wait a sec.

292
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,380
Okuyasu, you aren't trying
to trick me by luring me

293
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,550
closer with money so you can attack
me with your Stand, are you?

294
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,930
Ah! So you are!

295
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,680
Did you really think I'd fall for that?

296
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,270
You really thought I was that stupid?

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,690
I won't forgive you anymore!

298
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,190
That's fine, if you don't forgive us.

299
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,730
But it's too late.

300
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:18,910
Don't you realize that you're
already in The Hand's range?

301
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,370
I'm going to scrape away space

302
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,270
and make it

303
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,510
teleport!

304
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,210
We got it back.

305
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,910
Got it back?

306
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,990
Wh-What are you talking about?

307
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,920
I'll just easily take it back...

308
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,670
You don't seem to realize, Shigechi,

309
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,230
that you have no chance of winning now.

310
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,430
The five million!

311
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,450
What are you doing?!

312
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,090
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

313
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,770
Stop!

314
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,940
Why would you do that?!

315
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,190
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

316
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,570
That's five million yen!

317
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,010
Basically, just try and injure or kill us.

318
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,310
The only one that can fix this
note is my Shining Diamond...

319
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,080
So there's no way you can win.

320
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Oh... I-I see! Conceivable!

321
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,090
And what happens next certifies your loss.

322
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,390
H-Huh? Again, inconceivable! Inconceivable!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

323
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,430
What are you doing?!

324
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,930
Pick them all up, Harvest!

325
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,590
Looks like you don't realize that

326
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,090
the fact that you're having
Harvest go pick them up

327
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,210
means that you've lost.

328
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:41,740
So now who's going to protect you
from these two drunks right here?

329
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,120
Oh, conceivable...

330
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,570
Smash

331
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,630
We did it.

332
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,420
Now, Shigechi...

333
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,570
Why don't we review something very simple?

334
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,330
The one that collects all
the pieces is your Harvest,

335
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,430
and whose Stand is the one that
will put them back together?

336
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,640
Hm?

337
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,300
Who is it?

338
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,490
Who's going to fix it with
their Shining Diamond?

339
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,020
J-Josuke...

340
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,000
Whack
Whack

341
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,020
Josuke? Did you just address me so casually?

342
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,870
M-Mr. Josuke!

343
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,030
That's right, it's Mr. Josuke.

344
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,320
But who was the one who just took
back the promissory note from you?

345
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
Say his name.

346
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,840
O-Okuyasu...

347
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,410
Mr. Okuyasu!

348
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,290
Well done. That's a good boy.

349
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,770
All right, next, let's do a little calculation.

350
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,860
How should we split the five million?

351
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,090
How would we split it so
that no one feels slighted?

352
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,840
H-Half is fine...

353
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
In half?

354
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,340
You realize now that there are
three of us here, don't you?

355
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,180
So isn't half a bit off?

356
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,600
That doesn't really add up at all.

357
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,850
Hello?

358
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,060
I-It'd be a third...

359
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,940
Th-That's right...

360
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,000
If it was just me, I'd only be able to gather.

361
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,410
I-I was wrong.

362
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,950
We all found this lottery ticket.

363
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,150
We wouldn't have gotten it
without the three of us.

364
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,170
I...

365
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,030
I realize that now. I was blinded by greed.

366
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,420
Let's split it up evenly,
so no one is slighted.

367
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,510
Bam

368
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,960
Yes!

369
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,440
B-Bills!

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,190
I-It's five million yen!

371
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,520
Please consider depositing it into our
Budogaoka Bank for peace of mind.

372
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
Of course!

373
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,230
We finally did it! It's like a dream!

374
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,280
Wait... Splitting it up evenly
so no one is slighted, huh?

375
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,710
Huh? This is weird.

376
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,060
If we're going to split it up evenly,

377
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,290
isn't it unfair if we don't include
the number of Stands we have?

378
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,620
If we consider that my Stand,
Harvest, is about 500,

379
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,550
then we should split it 500 to 1 and 1.

380
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,470
Don't you think so?

381
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,910
You little bastard!

382
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,520
You're seriously going to
argue about this again?

383
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,870
It's never going to end, you dumbass!

384
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,680
O-One third is fine!

385
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:24,510
Josuke Higashikata – Money Currently in Possession – 1,666,666 yen

386
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,250
It's a bit unforgivable for first-years
in high school to have this much, but...

387
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,050
To be continued!
