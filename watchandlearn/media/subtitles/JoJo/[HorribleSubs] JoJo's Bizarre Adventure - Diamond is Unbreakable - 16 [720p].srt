00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,480
Josuke, I'm about to go hunting.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,810
Huh?

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,270
Come with me.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:09,930
Huh?

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,130
W-Wait a sec, Jotaro.
Did you just say "hunting"?

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,020
Does that mean...

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,610
We're gonna be hunting down
some chicks with nice bodies?

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm a guy who's more into pure love,
so I've never done that.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,970
I wonder if I can do it...

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,110
Akira Otoishi confessed yesterday.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,670
Otoishi did?!

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,440
Before his identity was revealed,
he was using the bow and arrow.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,930
He happened to shoot a rat with the arrow.

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,180
A rat?!

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,920
The rat didn't die after it was shot.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,660
It writhed in pain and
freed itself from the arrow,

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,940
then ran away.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,930
So even though it's a rat, this means that

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,510
it has definitely obtained Stand abilities.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,190
I'm not sure what kind of Stand it is,

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,030
but we have to hunt it down
before something happens.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,640

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,310
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,310
Diamond is Unbreakable

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,760
Episode 16    Let's Go Hunting!

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,960
Wow, kewl!

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,640
Getting a small, quick rat into your
Stand's range will be difficult,

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,500
but by using the bearings, your range
will increase to about 20 meters.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,890
This should be obvious, but it
won't work against a Stand.

32
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,910
You'll only be able to use it to defeat the user.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,140
Try it.

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,950
What? I have to do it, too?

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,650
I don't know... My mind tends to wander
when ball-shaped things are involved.

36
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,370
The second one was so close!

37
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,820
Not bad. I'd give it 85 points.

38
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,000
But before our pursuit,
I'll give you a warning.

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,000
When dealing with living creatures,

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,940
you need to put composure ahead of speed.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,720
If the rat enters your range and you miss,

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,890
it won't ever step into your range again.

43
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,030
So don't fire until you're positive you'll hit it.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm not trying to put pressure
on you, but remember that.

45
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm feeling plenty pressured now.

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,550
Apparently, Akira Otoishi shot the rat

47
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,770
near this irrigation canal.

48
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,160
Given the area, it was probably a brown rat.

49
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,170
Brown rats can swim,
live anywhere, and eat anything.

50
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,610
The big ones reach about
20 to 30 centimeters long,

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,050
and some can weigh one kilogram.

52
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,180
They can jump about 2 meters.

53
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,310
Found it.

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,680
Aren't those a bird's tracks?

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,790
Their front paws have four digits,
and the back ones have five.

56
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,440
It's dragging something,
forming this S-shape.

57
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,650
This line was made by its tail.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,430
It's a rat that's around 20 centimeters long.

59
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,740
I'm not sure how many,
but they're definitely here.

60
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,690
There's a tick on this leaf.

61
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,280
That means rats come through here often.

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,750
Without a doubt, there's a nest
deep in that drainage channel.

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,860
For now, we'll set a trap
here and video tape it.

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
That's one of those cameras that let you
watch while you're taping, right?

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
You're not using cheese for the trap?

66
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,030
It's a crumb of tempura.

67
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,000
Cheese is too extravagant for rats.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,040
There sure are a lot of flies...

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
Jotaro!

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,410
Th-This is...

71
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,850
Rat corpses?

72
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,910
It's exactly what it looks like!

73
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,670
It's like the jelly from stewed fish.

74
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,250
Why the heck are you poking at it?!

75
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,290
It's flesh.

76
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,760
The flesh of these rats was melted
once, then hardened again.

77
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,480
And they died from having the flesh
under their skin melted.

78
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,230
What do you even do to leave
behind a corpse like this?

79
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm not sure...

80
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,830
But we can probably assume it's the
work of the rat that we're after.

81
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,420
It used its Stand?

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,140
It killed the others and
made their territory its own.

83
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,990
Which means...

84
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,830
It's definitely making a nest at
the end of this drainage channel.

85
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,340
But the question is

86
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,400
if something capable of doing
this will just stay quiet.

87
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,500
Looks like the drainage
channel leads to that farm.

88
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,170
We might already be too late.

89
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,720
R-Really?

90
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,750
They have a chicken coop,
but there aren't any chickens.

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,440
There are no signs of life
at the house, either.

92
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,720
It doesn't look like they just went out,
and the front door isn't locked.

93
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,120
The rat is there.

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,540
And just as I feared,

95
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,710
it's likely that the people living
there have already been killed.

96
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,780
Let's go check out that house.

97
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,900
The rat will let us approach
within a certain distance,

98
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,260
because it's confident that no
slow human is going to catch it.

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,740
It's not expecting us to blast bearings at it.

100
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,510
That's how we'll get close
enough to nail it in one shot.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,930
Found something.

102
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,420
Rat droppings.

103
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,610
Not made up of grass or grain, either.

104
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,740
It's meat.

105
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,160
They're heading toward this room.

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,140
Let's check it out.

107
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,860
Right.

108
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,250
What is that?

109
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,250
The sound of a refrigerator's compressor?

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,390
What the heck?

111
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,760
Does the refrigerator in
this house open on its own?

112
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,540
Has the magnet in the door weakened?

113
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,040
What?! There it is!

114
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,300
Damn it! It's right there!

115
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,940
That's what opened the refrigerator just now!

116
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,100
Can rats actually open refrigerator doors?!

117
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,570
Nah... Someone living here must
not have shut the door all the way.

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,770
And... Am I actually naïve
enough to believe that?

119
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,580
This rat is a Stand user!

120
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,790
Jo—

121
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,420
Jotaro's not here!

122
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,830
He went to the next room.

123
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,220
Great. Now our eyes have met.

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
Th-This is...

125
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,730
Did that rat do this?!

126
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,770
They're still alive...

127
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you telling me that rat used
its Stand to turn the owners

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
into this, then preserved them in the fridge?

129
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,310
And it's eating them!

130
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,070
Damn it... Jotaro's not coming back.

131
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,490
That means I'm gonna have to kill this thing.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,700
When dealing with living creatures,

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,220
I need to put composure ahead of speed, right?

134
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,950
If I don't get it in one try,
it'll figure out my range.

135
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,700
That's what he said, right? Damn it...

136
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,250
Talk about pressure!

137
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,070
From here, the table and chair
are slightly in the way.

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,260
I'm gonna make sure I blast this
bearing right into your forehead.

139
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,960
Stay right there for a bit...

140
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,020
Shit! It stopped eating.

141
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,170
If I move any more, it might run away!

142
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,640
I have no choice! It'll be an adventure,

143
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,780
but I'm gonna have to shoot from here!

144
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,320
It's moving! Now!

145
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,150
Crush

146
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,580
Yes!

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,330
It wasn't a fatal blow!

148
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,270
There it is!

149
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,340
That must be its Stand!

150
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,300
You're gonna try to attack me?

151
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,370
Don't underestimate me!

152
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,300
I'll get you with the next shot!

153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,510
Crap! It's running under the table to get away!

154
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,630
I'm not going to let you!

155
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,980
Jotaro, what are you doing?!

156
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,360
The rat's here!

157
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,030
That shape...

158
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,160
Shit! It's a Stand that shoots something!

159
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,540
What should I do? Slap it
away with my bare hands?

160
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,750
But that's gross, so maybe not...

161
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,510
Which is it?

162
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,380
Did I hit it, or did I miss?

163
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,210
You bastard!

164
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,300
Yes! I nailed it!

165
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,030
I didn't hit it in the forehead, but I beat it.

166
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,500
That was close...

167
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,400
Jotaro, over here!

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
I got the rat! It's over!

169
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,470
Jeez. What were you doing?

170
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,770
You went missing at the most crucial time.

171
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,020
I felt totally stranded.

172
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,910
But wouldn't you know it...

173
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,400
I just barely made the bearing shot.

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,130
I wasn't trying to do a pun with "barely" there.

175
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,260
It had a Stand that shot
something like needles.

176
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,330
I bet if they hit you, they melt your flesh.

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,360
The people who live here got hit,
but they're still alive.

178
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,830
I can fix them with Shining Diamond.

179
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,370
If we don't take care of this by sundown,

180
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,930
we may have a problem.

181
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,710
Huh?

182
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,770
There's one more. I was just attacked by it.

183
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,860
Jotaro! Y-Your hand...

184
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,870
I was hit in the next room.

185
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,970
I could have dodged it...

186
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,370
Grabbing it to figure out the effects
of those needles was a mistake.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,550
Just by touching the needle,

188
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,880
some kind of "Stand poison" courses
through you, melting even Stands.

189
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,660
Getting hit by five or six of those

190
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,780
would be enough to turn
a human into mush.

191
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,880
Thank goodness I dodged!

192
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,640
I'm lucky our personalities are so different.

193
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,360
That rat ran outside afterward.

194
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,990
It must've figured out that you
finished off the one in the kitchen.

195
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,870
I hate to ask, but I'm sort of waiting
for you to fix me up quickly.

196
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,690
O-Oh, right!

197
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,860
Damn it!

198
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,720
Why does there have to be another one?

199
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,490
Jo

200
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:08,660
Jota

201
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:08,870
Jotaro Ku

202
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,000
Jotaro Kujo

203
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,620
S

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,700
Sta

205
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:09,750
Star

206
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,830
Star P

207
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:09,910
Star Pla

208
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,000
Star Plati

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Star Platinum

210
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,000
Hello, this is the Speedwagon
Foundation research team.

211
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,010
Hello, this is Jotaro Kujo.

212
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,300
Jotaro!

213
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,930
We've tried to call you several times already.

214
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,580
I was in pursuit, so my ringer was off.

215
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,610
Does it have to do with Otoishi?

216
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,770
Yes. Akira Otoishi hid the fact
that he had shot two rats.

217
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,970
Let me confirm.

218
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,530
It was two, and not three or four?

219
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,530
Yes, there's no doubt about it.

220
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,100
Good grief, Akira Otoishi...

221
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,780
Way to go.

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,240
It kills everything in its territory,

223
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,020
whether they are humans or its own kind.

224
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,290
It only cares about itself.

225
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,270
It's not a creature that should be
allowed to live on this Earth anymore.

226
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,420
Jotaro, wait!

227
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,590
How are you planning to chase
after a tiny little rat

228
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,800
that's run out into this giant field?

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,240
The author of Seton Animal
Chronicles, E.T. Seton, said,

230
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,310
"There is no animal that cannot be tracked."

231
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,810
Rats have a habit of not wanting
to go down an unfamiliar path.

232
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,430
Which means, without a doubt, it went back

233
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,290
toward that irrigation channel.

234
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,410
And if they don't eat constantly,

235
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,910
they will die from starvation
after about ten hours.

236
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,910
There... Those bite marks are new.

237
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,660
Yes! This is awesome!

238
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,100
We'll be able to corner it!

239
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,960
Take a look at this.

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,740
It didn't even glance at the bait in the trap.

241
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,010
It's on the video.

242
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,750
Its ear looks like a leaf that's
been eaten on by a bug.

243
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,480
Let's call it "Bug-Eaten" from now on.

244
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,150
Look at how cautious it is...

245
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,240
Unlike earlier,

246
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,810
we can probably bet that
Bug-Eaten won't let us

247
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,970
within 20 meters of him.

248
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,490
These are rifle rounds.

249
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,960
Just in case, I brought four rounds.

250
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,710
A-Actual rounds?!

251
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,320
Because of air resistance,
when round bearings fly

252
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,320
over 20 meters, the point
of impact goes off-course.

253
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,470
With the head of this round,
we'll be okay up to 70 meters.

254
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,550
Am I going to shoot that
with my Stand's hand, too?

255
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,980
I'm not confident about this at all.

256
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,230
Of course not. I guess I'll just have to do it.

257
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,730
Hold on...

258
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,610
Why'd you have to say it like that?

259
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,490
That kind of pissed me off.

260
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm the one who took care of the other one!

261
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,380
Sure, it wasn't a perfect shot, but...

262
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,360
Right. So carry two rounds.

263
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,820
Huh?

264
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,840
S-So much pressure...

265
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,570
Be careful. There are leeches in this puddle.

266
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,650
What?!

267
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,050
Impossible...

268
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,400
What's wrong?

269
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,800
Be careful, Josuke.

270
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,730
The footprints suddenly disappear here.

271
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,050
What is this?!

272
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,560
Why'd the footprints disappear?

273
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,680
I know! It's under the dirt.

274
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
It must've dug a hole, then covered itself.

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,570
No!

276
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,970
This is backtracking...

277
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,690
I didn't think that rats did it, too.

278
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,320
Backtracking?

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,610
Backtracking is a special
instinct that wild animals have

280
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,800
in which they go back the way
they came to hide from an enemy.

281
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,180
In Japan, it's said that brown bears,
weasels, and rabbits do this.

282
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,840
But there's no record of
rats backtracking, too.

283
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,720
Does that mean, basically,
that the rat put one over on us?

284
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,320
Things aren't looking good.

285
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,540
With this terrain...

286
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,010
We might actually be the
ones who are being hunted.

287
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,640
I feel like something's staring at us.

288
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,240
We need to hide behind a rock.

289
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,550
Move calmly...

290
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,420
Bug-Eaten's Stand's attack
isn't too fast for us to see.

291
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,540
Don't miss where it's coming from.

292
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,350
If we can find where it's hiding,
we'll shoot it instead.

293
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,380
What the hell is this?!

294
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,190
Wha?!

295
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,020
The rat used the trap that we set for it?

296
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,230
Star Platinum, The World!

297
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,570
Good grief.

298
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,040
Don't panic.

299
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,290
I took out the needle before
the poison spread,

300
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,720
along with the flesh that it pierced.

301
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,270
Put a bandage on it.

302
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,540
And I figured out where the rat's hiding.

303
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,420
Halfway up the hill, near those three rocks.

304
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,640
You're amazing! Both the rat and you, Jotaro!

305
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,770
Am I the only loser this time around?

306
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,770
It's 60 meters away.

307
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,830
It doesn't look like it's going
to shoot more needles yet.

308
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,710
It knows that if it shoots too much,

309
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,780
we'll be able to pinpoint
its location and attack.

310
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,970
Stubborn little bastard.

311
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,290
Why are you complimenting the rat?

312
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,290
We need to do something.

313
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,620
Well said, Josuke.

314
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
We need to give it everything we've got,

315
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,330
or Bug-Eaten's gonna get us.

316
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,800
I'll give you all four rounds.

317
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,890
At this distance, it'll go up like a slider,

318
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,240
so aim one centimeter lower than the target.

319
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,060
Jotaro? What are you going to do?

320
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,590
I'm going to get closer
so it'll shoot the needles.

321
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,420
You're going to find out where it is, Josuke...

322
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,490
And then you're going to attack.

323
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,990
Wh-What?!

324
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,950
You're the only one who can do this.

325
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,020
Even if I get hit with one
or two of its needles,

326
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,740
I can have Shining Diamond fix me.

327
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,700
But Josuke, you can't fix yourself.

328
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,890
Give it all you've got, Josuke!

329
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,900
I-I need time to mentally prepare!

330
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,070
Star Platinum, The World!

331
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,910
Did you find it?

332
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,720
N-No... It moved right after it fired!

333
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll try to get closer while
going up the side of the hill.

334
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,220
Look for the moment it fires.

335
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,960
The moment it fires...

336
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,260
Th-The pressure!

337
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,900
There! I see it!

338
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,430
What?!

339
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,750
That bastard calculated that I'd dodge

340
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,190
and then fired the needles at the rocks?

341
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,780
It ricocheted?

342
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,120
Jotaro!

343
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,730
Don't look at me, Josuke!

344
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,530
Aim at the rat!

345
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,130
Get it right when it's about to attack!

346
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,510
This isn't good.

347
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,360
I've got four rounds, but I won't
get any more chances.

348
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,130
If I waste any time...

349
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,120
Here we go, Josuke.

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,800
There! It's the same spot as before.

351
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,730
But it's hiding behind the rocks.

352
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,730
Damn it! If only it was looking over here...

353
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,820
But I've got to do this!

354
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,870
I'm just going to have
to hit that small target!

355
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,630
I'm suddenly feeling stronger.

356
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm going to get you, you little bastard.

357
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Josuke missed...

358
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,990
So you did look.

359
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,440
I thought you'd look if I missed,
and face your body this way.

360
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,950
Now I can target you for sure.

361
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,670
In the end, I wasn't a loser at all.

362
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,680
Call me Josuke Higashikata,
the man who deflects pressure!

363
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,650
The Stand rats that Akira Otoishi created...

364
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,280
Considering the destruction of
nature that humanity brought on,

365
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm not sure how to feel...

366
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,060
But thankfully, Josuke's pretty reliable.

367
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,780
Good grief. We can finally relax a little.
