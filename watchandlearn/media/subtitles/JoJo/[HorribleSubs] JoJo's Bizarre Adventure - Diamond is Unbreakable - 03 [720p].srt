Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,490
Diamond is Unbreakable

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,960
Episode 3  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 1

5
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,190
Yeah. The issue with Angelo's been resolved.

6
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,770
But I won't be coming back for a while.

7
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,870
That other photo we've been investigating...

8
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,460
Send it over, too.

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,450
Yeah, the one that the Speedwagon
Foundation found in Egypt ten years ago.

10
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,820
I think I might finally know what it means.

11
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,520
Please.

12
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,460
Yeah, thanks to him.

13
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,420
Josuke! I killed your grandpa,
but you have no right to kill me!

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,590
If you kill me, you'll end up
a cursed soul, just like me!

15
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,100
Don't go telling people what
they can and can't do.

16
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,110
M-M-My right hand! My hand!

17
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,040
No one's going to execute you.

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
Not me, and not Jotaro, either.

19
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,410
You're not going to be executed,

20
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,530
and you're not going back to jail.

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,770
Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.

22
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,370
Wh-What do you plan to do
with me, you bastards?!

23
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,100
Repent for eternity, Angelo!

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,080
For all of those you killed,
including my Gramps!

25
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,560
Damn it...

26
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,810
Don't you dare get cocky!

27
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,070
I'm sure he'll kill you both for me.

28
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,780
What? "He"?

29
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,140
That's right. The one wearing a school uniform,

30
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,610
who gave me this power.

31
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,040
What?

32
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,240
It can't be...

33
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,050
Are you saying someone can
willingly give another a Stand?

34
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,180
Are you scared?

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,290
Huh? How is that supposed to scare us?

36
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,090
No... Angelo's not a Stand user by birth.

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,340
It was a mystery how he
obtained his Stand powers.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,850
But if there is actually a person
who can give others Stands...

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,850
Terrifying, isn't it?

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,600
Want me to tell you?

41
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,520
It was last year, so 1998,

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,860
on a night about a month
before my execution.

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,820
I couldn't sleep that night...

44
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,870
I was just staring blankly
up at the ceiling of my cell.

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,960
It was a completely silent night.

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,750
But then...

47
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,370
I should've been the only one in that dark cell,

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,010
but he was there.

49
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,810
The guy in the school uniform.

50
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,560
H-Hey! How long have you been there?!

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,810
Where'd you come from?!

52
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,070
Wha...

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,410
It was a very old bow and arrow.

54
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,070
It looked like it was centuries old.

55
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,090
Wh-What are you doing?

56
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,000
I was so scared, I could almost
feel my balls shriveling up.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,870
But before I even had a chance to scream...

58
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,070
You're alive. Congratulations.

59
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,070
That means you've got the aptitude.
If you didn't, you'd be dead.

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,380
You've just obtained a talent.

61
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,830
No... It's more accurate to say
it was pulled from your mind.

62
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,250
The worse the villain, the more they have...

63
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,460
This talent that the man
named Dio called a "Stand."

64
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,810
Dio?

65
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,070
Did you say Dio?

66
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,470
Jotaro? Is something...

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,210
What?!

68
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,840
You fools!

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,610
It looks like you were so busy

70
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,390
listening to my story that you
forgot about my Aqua Necklace!

71
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,450
Angelo, you bastard!

72
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,270
Josuke! Hurry up and get me out of this rock!

73
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,790
It would appear that...

74
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,790
I didn't have enough rage in my heart for you.

75
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,890
What are you doing? Stop messing
with your stupid hair!

76
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,090
I'm gonna kill this brat!
Let me out right now!

77
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,680
What did you say...

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,220
Don't be rash, Josuke!

79
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,470
...about my hair?

80
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,940
Y-You know... If you kill me,

81
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,370
the guy in the school uniform won't let it slide!

82
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,650
He lives in this town, too!

83
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,530
What? Josuke, wait!

84
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,770
Ker-Blam

85
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,570
Yeah... I just didn't have enough rage earlier.

86
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,600
I needed to do a great job of burying
that asshole into the rock, like this.

87
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,430
Good grief.

88
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,580
I wanted to get a bit more out of him.

89
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,690
Huh? You actually believe
the crap he was saying?

90
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,820
It wasn't crap. He said Dio's name.

91
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,150
Who is that, anyway?

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,230
He's a man that the Joestar family has
been fighting for over a hundred years.

93
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,290
My friends and I fought Dio and defeated him.

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,970
But there was one thing
that I didn't understand.

95
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,970
Back in 1987, why did the man
called Dio suddenly acquire a Stand?

96
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,970
Could the same person
have made him a Stand user?

97
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,470
Yeah... The guy in the school
uniform might be our new enemy.

98
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,820
Or perhaps it's the bow and arrow he had.

99
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,100
If that's somewhere in this city...

100
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,070
Then it's hard to believe that
Angelo's the only danger here.

101
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,850
Good grief...

102
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,020
Morioh City Report

103
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,000
Morioh City Report

104
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,750
It's just like Jotaro said.

105
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,920
There's no doubt that the worst thing
imaginable is hiding in this city.

106
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,140
An extremely terrible danger
is coming to this city...

107
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,760
No, it's already begun.

108
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,190
Since the beginning of this year, 1999,
81 people have disappeared in Morioh City.

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:34,570
Abductions & Kidnapping Cases

110
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,410
Of that number, 45 of them
were young boys and girls.

111
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,080
Even if some were runaways,

112
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,570
Have You Seen This Person?

113
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,690
that's still seven to eight times greater
than Japan's national average per city.

114
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,570
That number is extreme.

115
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,070
Not to mention...

116
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,600
Ryohei Higashikata Dead
(Morioh Police Officer)

117
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,210
Josuke's grandfather...

118
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,000
Koichi, you're even studying after school?

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,290
Let's go home.

120
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,170
Oh, right.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,450
Thank goodness. Josuke
seems to be feeling better.

122
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,430
Yo, Angelo.

123
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,270
Uh... Huh? Hey, was this rock always here?

124
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,300
Yeah, but it didn't look like this at first.

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,470
At first?

126
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,680
Well, whatever. Yo, Angelo...

127
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,740
By the way, what happened to Jotaro?

128
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,130
Oh, he said he had something
he wanted to look into.

129
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,750
He's staying at the Grand Hotel.

130
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,870
Does it have to do with this city?

131
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm sure it does.

132
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,490
I see.

133
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,780
The danger this city faces...

134
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,020
Huh? Josuke?

135
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,850
No one's lived in this house for
about three or four years, right?

136
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,950
Yeah. It's so run-down that
there's no way it'd sell.

137
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,200
It should be torn down and rebuilt.

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,100
No, someone's living here.
Maybe someone moved in?

139
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,330
There was someone in the window just now.

140
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,340
Huh? Nah, that can't be.
My house is over there, right?

141
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,890
I'd know right away if someone moved in.

142
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,880
Besides, realtors are always checking

143
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,280
to make sure homeless people don't crash there.

144
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,810
Now that you mention it, that's true.

145
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,310
How strange. I wonder if I actually saw a ghost...

146
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,400
H-Hey, don't say stuff like that.

147
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,480
Ghosts are scary! And we're
right in front of my house.

148
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,790
Stop gawking at my house, little brat.

149
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,490
Billion

150
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,330
Billion

151
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,580
Say something!

152
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,820
Koichi!

153
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,420
What? That's my line.

155
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,430
You two are in front of my house...

156
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,930
Morioh City Landmark 1
The Angelo Stone
How to get there: A minute's
walk from Morioh City
Johzenji Street Bus Stop #3.
The Angelo Stone
is known as a landmark,
and a place where lovers meet.
It's admired by
the people of the city,
despite its creepy appearance.

157
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,580
Give it a rest.

158
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,190
If you're the newspaper guy,
I already told you we don't want it.

159
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,950
Who is it?!

160
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,850
My father just died of a stroke,

161
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,190
and we're still busy with
everything that follows.

162
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,830
Could you come back another time?

163
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,840
Y-You're...

164
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,930
Jo...

165
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,970
Joseph!

166
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,200
You finally came back, Joseph!

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,220
I was waiting for you this whole time!

168
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,290
I've been so sad and lonely since my dad died.

169
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,570
I can't believe you showed up
at a time like this, Joseph!

170
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,570
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you,

171
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,650
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you!

172
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,950
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm not Joseph Joestar.

173
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,320
Huh?

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,420
Take a good look. No wrinkles.

175
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,430
Oh... Now that you mention it...

176
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,830
You're pretty young!

177
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,650
Good grief...

178
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,360
I'm Joseph's grandson. My name's Jotaro Kujo.

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,840
O-Oh, really?

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,420
Ask Josuke for the rest of the details.

181
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,720
I hate annoying conversations.

182
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm here to see Josuke. Is he here?

183
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,510
I'm asking you where Josuke is.

184
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,820
Huh? Oh! Josuke hasn't come
home from school... yet.

185
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,820
I see... Then I'll be back tonight.

186
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Huh?

187
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,700
You're leaving already?

188
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,580
Oh, yeah...

189
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,460
About your father...

190
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,260
Huh?

191
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,340
It's a shame.

192
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,790
If Joseph Joestar had come to this city,

193
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,010
he would have protected you as best
he could from the dangers to come.

194
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,660
But he's old now.

195
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,010
I can't let him come here.

196
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,680
I'm here in his place.

197
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,260
I just can't feel at ease.

198
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,650
The bow and arrow that
Angelo was talking about...

199
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,010
In documents the Speedwagon Foundation
obtained regarding the witch, Enyaba...

200
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,160
She's holding the bow and arrow.

201
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,140
They give ordinary people the power of a Stand.

202
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,800
Damn, that's unbelievable...

203
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,290
No Trespassing

204
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,470
Are you insane?

205
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,950
Let him go.

206
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:55,380
No Trespassing

207
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,200
My father bought this house.

208
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,920
Don't go digging around here.

209
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,390
Never do it again!

210
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm not talking about that.

211
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,980
I'm telling you to let go of him, bastard.

212
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,030
If you don't let him go now,
I'm gonna get pissed off.

213
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,050
Come on, now. "Bastard" is a bit much, ain't it?

214
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,260
Calling someone you just met a bastard
right in front of their house...

215
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,620
Do you even know how to talk to people?

216
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, I know how to shut that mouth of yours.

217
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,410
Stab

218
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,880
What?!

219
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,920
Bro?!

220
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,560
Do you wanna know why
I shot him with the arrow?

221
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,780
Because that guy is Josuke Higashikata.

222
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,390
Oh, really? He is?

223
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,430
Since he defeated Angelo,

224
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,650
that means he's a Stand user
who'll be trouble for us, too.

225
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,860
A Stand user?! You two are Stand users?!

226
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,870
Okuyasu! Make Josuke Higashikata disappear!

227
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,520
Koichi...

228
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,350
Hmph! I was hoping I could
make him into a Stand user

229
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,430
that I could use like the others,

230
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,750
but I guess that's not happening.

231
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,510
He's gonna die.

232
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,100
M-Move!

233
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,510
I can still heal his wounds
with my Shining Diamond!

234
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,600
No!

235
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,280
Josuke Higashikata! I, Okuyasu
Nijimura, will make you disappear

236
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,530
with my The Hand!

237
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,580
Here we go!

238
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,630
If you don't move, I'm seriously
going to mess up your face.

239
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,070
You're pretty fast.

240
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,640
Hey, Okuyasu.

241
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,990
Using a Stand is the same as
driving a car or riding a bike.

242
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,860
Dipshits with no skill or guts

243
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,220
will get scared and maneuver like crap,

244
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,720
no matter what kind of
monster machine they ride.

245
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,320
Bro...

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,470
Please don't say things
that'll piss me off too much.

247
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,660
This bastard's much faster than I thought.

248
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,580
We're not messing around here, Okuyasu!

249
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:26,980
The Stand that you acquired, The Hand,
gives me chills just thinking about it.

250
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,940
You'd better be serious when you use it.

251
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,090
Make sure you kill Josuke Higashikata,
who defeated Angelo, no matter what!

252
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,650
He's bound to get in our way.

253
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,720
I know—

254
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,760
Ah! I was talking!

255
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,480
Th-That's not fair!

256
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,160
You're pretty stupid, aren't you?

257
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
What? Why?!

258
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,990
Why do you think tha—

259
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,900
I told you to move.

260
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,590
Koichi!

261
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,490
Thank goodness. You're still alive.

262
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,160
Then I can still save...

263
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,670
That's it! You're gonna pay for that!

264
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,630
I told you to move!

265
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,460
Get any closer and you'll really piss me off!

266
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,570
Take your best shot, if you can!

267
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,020
He's got way too much
confidence in his right hand.

268
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,740
This isn't good.

269
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,960
I've got a really bad feeling
about that right hand of his...

270
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,470
Let go of my right hand, you little shit!

271
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,860
Yeah, it's his right hand!

272
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,400
Swoop

273
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,870
Why, you...

274
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,570
Don't you dare run away, Josuke!

275
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,090
Don't abandon your friend like that!

276
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,070
There's something up with
that right hand of yours.

277
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,130
Something's telling me it's not safe.

278
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,680
Think about that after you're dead!

279
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Here I go!

280
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Koichi... Just hang on a little longer...

281
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,940
No  passing

282
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,940
What's with that gate?
Something's wrong with it...

283
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,690
No... passing?

284
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,370
Stop walking backwards, you dumbass.

285
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,650
You're getting farther away from your buddy.

286
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,210
Come a bit closer!

287
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,260
That's it... The "tres" is missing.

288
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,430
I bet your Stand's right hand

289
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,130
scraped it off, right?

290
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,640
It has the power to scrape
away its surroundings.

291
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,500
No  passing

292
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,970
That's right, Josuke Higashikata!

293
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,750
Whatever this right hand
grabs gets scraped away.

294
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,940
And the parts that don't get scraped away...

295
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,660
close together, so it looks like nothing changed.

296
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,880
As for the part that gets scraped away...

297
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,410
Even I don't know where it ends up!

298
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,380
I can do this to guys who try to run away, too.

299
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,390
I scrape away the space between us! And then...

300
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,480
See? You came right to me.

301
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,730
You could call it teleporting!

302
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,440
This is the power of the Stand
even my bro fears, The Hand!

303
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,950
You can't run away anymore,

304
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,870
Josuke!

305
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,290
No matter where you go, you're...

306
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,790
always...

307
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,790
within my reach!

308
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,010
So weak!

309
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,260
You really beat Angelo like this?

310
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,870
I guess you just don't get that it's no use.

311
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,480
You're the one who's stupid!

312
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,680
Now die, Josuke!

313
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,450
You really are stupid, aren't you?

314
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,120
Why?!

315
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,740
Smack

316
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,080
Crash

317
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,330
Kaboom

318
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,220
That was close. Okuyasu Nijimura, huh?

319
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,930
That's a pretty great and terrifying Stand.

320
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,360
I'll be in trouble if he wakes
up and tries to attack.

321
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,230
I guess I should strangle him a bit,
just to make sure he stays knocked out.

322
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,460
It'll put the feeling of defeat in his soul, too.

323
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,850
One, and...

324
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,450
K-Koichi's...

325
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,790
That's enough, you bastard!

326
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,480
This arrow is very precious.
It's the only one there is.

327
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,600
It's my precious objective.

328
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,650
I just have to retrieve it.

329
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,320
According to Angelo's story,

330
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,470
it's this bow and arrow that
unleashed Dio's Stand powers.

331
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,450
There's no doubt about it.
That unleashed The World...

332
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,300
And after Enyaba died,
someone obtained the bow and arrow,

333
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,340
and is creating more Stand users in Morioh City.

334
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,470
I've got to hurry and destroy
that bow and arrow...

335
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,180
To make sure a villain more evil than Dio

336
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,690
doesn't appear with a Stand
more powerful than The World.
