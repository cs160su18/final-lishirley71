Hello, Kawajiri residence.

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,090
July 16th (Fri)  7:57 AM

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,610
Huh? No, it's not.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,110
I see. Well done, Hayato.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,690
You protected me from that nuisance, Rohan.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm telling you that you
have the wrong number.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,940
Goodbye.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,870
Now, then...

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,870
They had the wrong number.

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,740
I guess I'll head to work so I can make

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,150
my precious family happy.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,910
But first, do you mind if
I give you a goodbye kiss?

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,590
Huh?

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,280
What are you doing?! My precious teapot...

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,530
Why would you do that?!

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,570
I never know what you're thinking!

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,440
You never even answer me! Why?!

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,040
Honestly...

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,790
Mom, he's not human.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,450
If I say anything about him to anyone,

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,550
they'll be blown away,
and the morning will reset.

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,530
If we just keep letting him do what he wants,

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,480
it might not happen now, but he'll
eventually kill me and my mom.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,690
R-Rohan Kishibe...

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,550
There was someone other than
Kira who had abilities.

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,970
I have to do something about Rohan Kishibe.

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,880
The only one who can save me
and my mom and defeat Kira

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,260
is someone with abilities like Rohan Kishibe!

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,430
Th-There he is. It's Rohan.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,560
If I meet Rohan, he'll be
blown away and die...

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,640
And then I'll repeat the same morning again.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,690
I have to tell Rohan about
him without meeting him.

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,870
I'm going to change fate!

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,270
Flip

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,460
Wh-What is this?!

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,220
[Warning]

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,790
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

39
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,790
It's Rohan's ability that he
used one me the last morning!

40
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,540
Damn it.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,280
I was hiding from Rohan this time!

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,470
Rohan didn't even see me!

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,010
Once fate has happened,
it can't be changed...

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,020
Hayato.

45
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,930
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

46
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,930
Diamond is Unbreakable

47
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,580
July 16th (Fri)  8:27 AM

48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,380
Episode 36      Bites the Dust, Part 2

49
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,240
Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!

50
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,220
You seem to be under the impression that
you purposely broke the teapot,

51
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,570
but that is incorrect.

52
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,580
Whatever broke last morning
will break again, no matter what.

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,250
It'll happen because it's meant to be.

54
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,720
That is what fate is.

55
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,750
If you were turned into a book last morning,

56
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,920
you'll turn into a book, no matter what.

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,930
This is why Deadly Queen
Bites the Dust is invincible.

58
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,990
It erases my identity and returns
everything else to what it was.

59
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,130
That means I get to observe Rohan
exploding before I head to work.

60
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,350
At 8:27 AM,
lightning struck
above the Pepsi sign.

61
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,350
It rained.

62
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,360
I can't let Rohan die!

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,570
I have to save Rohan!

64
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,090
Ah, Rohan Kishibe.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
Watch carefully.

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,050
He has no idea why he's dying right now.

67
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I wonder if he's thinking about how he
won't be able to draw his manga anymore.

68
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,920
R-Rohan...

69
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,930
N-No!

70
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,330
Hayato, the very fact that you
met Rohan will disappear,

71
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,940
and the morning will continue on.

72
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,450
If I undo Bites the Dust right now,

73
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,770
Rohan's death will just become
fact and not repeat again...

74
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,290
But for now, I won't undo it.

75
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,450
A few of his friends should
also be showing up, after all.

76
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,710
You're going to automatically
defeat them for me, as well.

77
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,180
Just like a landmine.

78
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,230
But Bites the Dust won't cause you any harm,

79
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,850
so you should relax and enjoy
your fun life as a young boy.

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,970
Well, I have to head to the station.

81
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,130
Make sure you study hard.

82
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,770
It's all my fault. It's because he met me...

83
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,520
Rohan Kishibe was killed because he met me!

84
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,120
Can't I do anything to defeat him?

85
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,260
Um... Can I ask you something?

86
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,170
Do you know what time it is?

87
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,420
My watch doesn't seem to be working right.

88
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,000
Hello? Are you listening?

89
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,020
It's 8:33...

90
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,400
Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
Where was it?

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,450
Do you know who I am?

93
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,870
No...

94
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,990
Huh... I guess I was imagining it.

95
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,830
Sorry for saying something weird.

96
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,210
8:33... Thanks!

97
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,710
Jotaro! It really is past 8:30.

98
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,840
Strange, though... I wonder
where Rohan-sensei went.

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Th-They're Rohan Kishibe's friends!

100
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,850
They were supposed to meet up!

101
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,080
He left the car door wide open
and the key in the ignition.

102
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,240
They probably have the same abilities...

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,860
Th-They also came to ask
me about Yoshikage Kira.

104
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,570
That's not like Rohan-sensei...

105
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,400
Crap! If they find out
that I'm Hayato Kawajiri

106
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,070
That's Rohan-sensei's earring.

107
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,070
and ask me about my dad...

108
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,310
Sorry about that.

109
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,140
I overslept and was late
meeting up with my friends.

110
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,970
Huh? I've seen you before... Where was it?

111
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,140
Ah, Josuke and Okuyasu.

112
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,050
Yo.

113
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,100
Yo, Koichi. Good morning, Jotaro.

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,200
What, so Rohan's the only
one who's not here yet?

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,960
A-And two more...

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,480
When he said his friends
were going to show up...

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,590
We won't know where Hayato Kawajiri's
house is if he's not here.

118
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,390
He must have been talking about them!

119
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,780
I just remembered I accidentally
grabbed onto this.

120
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,220
Here you go. Your hat.

121
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,040
Th-Thanks...

122
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,090
That angle...

123
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,570
It's that angle. I'm sure
I've seen him before...

124
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,550
Where was it? I know I've seen him...

125
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,300
Koichi. Look at the name on his backpack.

126
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,180
Huh?

127
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,550
Hayato Kawajiri

128
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,550
Hayato Kawajiri?!

129
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,300
What?!

130
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,720
I-I've been found out!

131
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Wake up

132
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Lightning strikes the Pepsi sign

133
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Kira leaves the house

134
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
The weather report begins

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Hayato meets Rohan

136
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Rohan Kishibe dies from explosion

137
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,400
July 16th (Fri)  8:34 AM

138
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,760
Hayato Kawajiri...

139
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,190
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,770
Is it a coincidence?

141
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,990
D-Does this have to do with
Rohan-sensei not being here?

142
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,390
If these four start asking me about my dad...

143
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,000
They're all going to be blown away!

144
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,260
N-No! Don't ask me any questions...

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,260
If you guys die, too,
who's going to defeat him?

146
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,010
Even if I have to deceive them...

147
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,480
I can't let these people die, no matter what!

148
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,190
I want to ask you about this photo...

149
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,190
I want to know why you were
recording a video in this photo.

150
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,700
Why were you recording your da—

151
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,780
M-My nose is bleeding!

152
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,990
I need to go to the clinic!
My nose is gushing blood!

153
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,670
I-I... Bye!

154
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,530
Hold it.

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,650
Your nose is bleeding? Let me see.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Here. What happened?

157
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,760
I have to go. Excuse me.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,480
You don't need to go to a clinic.

159
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,350
Your nose isn't bleeding.

160
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,270
Huh?

161
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,750
Huh?!

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,150
My name is Josuke Higashikata.

163
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,230
He's a relative of mine, Jotaro Kujo.

164
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,070
The one with the scary face
over there is Okuyasu Nijimura.

165
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,990
And the friendly-looking
guy there is Koichi Hirose.

166
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,170
You go to Budogaoka Elementary, don't you?

167
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,170
Then you won't be late just yet.

168
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,000
We just have some questions...

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
about this picture.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
If it's nothing, then that's fine.

171
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,960
W-Well, it is something!
Don't ask me any questions!

172
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
You can't ask me any questions!

173
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,680
Is the person in this picture

174
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,820
your da—

175
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,060
No! Don't say any more!

176
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,810
I-It's no use...

177
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,840
Now they're going to ask even more questions.

178
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,260
What do you mean by "Don't say anymore"?

179
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,430
One after another...

180
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,130
What are we not supposed to say?

181
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,480
I can't stop it anymore!

182
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,500
Are you talking about your dad?

183
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,850
They're going to explode!

184
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,540
They're all going to explode!

185
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,970
You suddenly shouted, "No!"

186
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,770
"Don't say any more"?

187
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,360
But we didn't ask you anything yet.

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,550
Could it be...

189
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,080
that even asking you a
question is a bad idea?

190
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,150
They're going to explode...
Explode... Explode...

191
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,430
I know...

192
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,310
I-If I die, no one else will have to die!

193
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,810
Since I'm the bomb, I just need to die!

194
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,070
If I die, I'm sure these people will be
able to defeat him and save my mom!

195
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,120
Come on, ask him about
Kosaku Kawajiri already.

196
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,310
Wait, Josuke. Something's wrong.

197
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,820
What are you crouching down for?

198
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,750
I-It won't go through...

199
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,510
For some reason, the box cutter
won't go into my throat!

200
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,560
That's...

201
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
That Stand...

202
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,180
I'd never forget it after seeing it once!

203
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,520
Deadly Queen!

204
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,610
To be more precise,

205
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,380
its Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

206
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,290
It's already too late to attack.

207
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,580
If you're seeing me, that means
I'm already inside your eyes.

208
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,580
It doesn't matter how many of you
there are, because all at once...

209
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,590
You tried to find out my identity!

210
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,980
What, you're already awake?

211
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,490
I'm glad you replied for once when I
called you, but there's no need to yell.

212
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,660
Breakfast is ready, so come on.

213
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,500
I couldn't stop it...
Those four got attacked, too.

214
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,890
It's no use... No matter how hard I try,

215
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,010
in an hour, fate is going to
eliminate those four, too...

216
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,890
I can't even kill myself.

217
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,020
My dying would be troublesome to him,

218
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,100
so Bites the Dust must be
automatically protecting me.

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,380
He's too strong...

220
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,140
Yoshikage Kira is too much of a monster.

221
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,560
Either he has to die, or he has to undo
Bites the Dust for whatever reason,

222
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,180
or those four are going to die for sure.

223
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,300
Either he has to die, or he
has to undo Bites the Dust...

224
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,310
I always thought there was no
way I could ever kill someone.

225
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,530
There was no way an 11-year-old boy
like me could kill a monster like that.

226
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,410
But there is one way!

227
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,570
A way for an 11-year-old
like me to kill him...

228
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,200
Just one.

229
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:44,290
And it's sleeping quietly in the dark
attic like a gun resting in an armory.

230
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,800
For the first time in my life, I was praying
to God from the bottom of my heart.

231
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,210
"Lord, please let me kill this man somehow."

232
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,720
I was right.

233
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,460
This cat-like plant starts moving
when sunlight hits it,

234
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,010
and then attacks by shooting air bullets.

235
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,080
And even with just this little bit of light
in the room, it's so destructive.

236
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
This behavior...

237
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,810
I'll utilize this behavior

238
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,420
and attack him with an
air bullet at point blank range.

239
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,860
Point blank range...

240
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,300
But when and how am I supposed to do that?

241
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,390
I can't do it in or near the house.

242
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,130
Mom's here.

243
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,630
That's it... My hat!

244
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,320
He'll come to put the hat on my head.

245
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,460
That'll be point blank range!

246
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,520
My chance will be when he
comes into range behind me.

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,530
That's when I have to do it!

248
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,430
What? No way! We're on the air already?

249
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,120
Er, um... It's now 7:55...

250
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,980
Dad was saying that he wanted
another cup of coffee.

251
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,710
Hello?

252
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,340
No, you've got the wrong number.

253
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,660
This isn't the Sakurai residence.

254
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,760
Here you go, darling. Thanks for waiting.

255
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,940
Here's your fresh cup of coffee.

256
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,400
Right...

257
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,170
It's a lovely morning.

258
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,950
I guess it wouldn't hurt to have
another cup before I go to work.

259
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,960
Fate doesn't change with
Bites the Dust, right?

260
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,460
Something that's been destroyed once will be
destroyed, no matter how much I fight it.

261
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,590
You said that, didn't you?

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,350
My precious tea set!

263
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,850
Serves you right!

264
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,020
All right, Mom, I'm heading to school!

265
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,150
I'll be there for you.
I'll protect you forever, Mom!

266
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,950
I can't believe it.

267
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,760
I really never have any idea
what he's thinking... But...

268
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,760
Maybe he's not so bad after all.

269
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,020
Oh, it's fine. I'll clean that up.

270
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,770
There's nothing we can
do now that it's broken.

271
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,180
More importantly, did you get burnt?

272
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,300
No... I'm fine.

273
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,650
He's not here yet...

274
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,990
H-He's not here... He's not here yet.

275
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,370
S-Something's wrong. He should have
already been here by now...

276
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,710
Why isn't he here?

277
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,460
Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!

278
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,590
I-It's starting to rain!

279
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,840
Did fate change because I
left the house before him?

280
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,150
No, that can't be!

281
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,140
If he's coming to put the hat on my head,

282
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,640
he should definitely come up from behind me.

283
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,150
L-Lightning struck the Pepsi sign!

284
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,760
Calm down. Calm down! There
are still two minutes left!

285
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,640
There's more than two minutes before
Rohan Kishibe is automatically blown away.

286
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,910
I need to believe in fate—

287
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,130
H-He's already by that tree...
He's already right there!

288
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,610
What a lovely morning.
But Hayato was acting strangely...

289
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,880
What was that?

290
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,480
It's just a hunch,
but something was strange...

291
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,660
It appears that we've repeated this morning

292
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,890
three... no, four times now.

293
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,900
I-Is he just that intuitive?

294
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,400
But there's no more time!

295
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll just have to attack him from here.

296
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,780
D-Did he figure out that
I have the cat plant,

297
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,580
and that's why he's not coming near me?

298
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,650
No... He's too close if he knows that.

299
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,370
But I have to completely
defeat him in one shot.

300
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,840
If I miss, Rohan will explode,
and then he'll undo Bites the Dust

301
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,770
after the other four are eliminated.

302
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,640
If that happens, he's going to win!

303
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,900
There's no time! Damn it...

304
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,600
Just one more step to the left!

305
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,890
If he just steps out from
behind that filthy tree,

306
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,900
I can attack!

307
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,150
What?! H-He's hidden himself even more!

308
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,820
The look in Hayato's eyes
when he left the house...

309
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,420
He looked determined about something.

310
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,780
It's the same look that the loathsome
Koichi Hirose and shitbag Josuke have.

311
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,260
My hunch is telling me to
carefully observe him...

312
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,170
Though there really isn't
much that Hayato can do...

313
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,530
It's too late!

314
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,970
Once it's a few seconds past 8:29,
the attack on Rohan Kishibe will start!

315
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,180
That brat is shaking.

316
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,400
Those eyes look like a despaired
mouse drowning in a cesspool.

317
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,900
I guess I was just imagining
his determination.

318
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,280
Those are definitely the eyes of a loser.

319
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,860
He moved!

320
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,660
I came to bring the hat you forgot, Hayato.

321
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,290
If there is a God, I thank you!

322
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,870
I thank the fate that got this murderer
to move from behind that tree!

323
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,710
I feel a fighting spirit burning within me!

324
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,390
Take this, Yoshikage Kira!

325
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,870
What?!

326
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,480
Y-Yes!

327
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,480
I hit him dead-on! I... I did it!

328
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,030
Hayato Kawajiri's not coming...

329
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,260
I guess he must've taken
a different route to school.

330
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,120
This is the end, you murderer!

331
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,590
Wh-Wh-What?!

332
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,420
Lately...

333
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,590
Impossible!

334
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,300
With my nails growing so quickly...

335
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,850
I got to thinking about how
unlucky I've been lately.

336
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,830
But inside my pocket...

337
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,860
It seems like, since last night,
luck is coming around to my side.

338
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,400
Remember when Mom's precious
tea cup broke this morning?

339
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,600
When the coffee spilled onto
my wrist, I was burned,

340
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,410
so I removed my watch and
put it in my chest pocket.

341
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,060
What unbelievable luck!

342
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,670
If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...

343
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,380
How... How is that possible? I...

344
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,880
I... I failed!

345
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,560
I-It's almost time!

346
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,460
