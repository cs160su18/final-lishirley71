00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,850
Look over here.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,360
J-Jotaro! L-Look!

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,980
Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,240
Hey, I told you to look over here.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,330
Is that his Stand?!

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,670
J-Jotaro!

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,780
H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,390
Good grief.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,540
Who would've thought he'd
come to get his suit now?

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,770
The jacket is evidence!

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,640
Wait!

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,600
Don't run after it without thinking.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,790
Something about that Stand...

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,070
is dangerous!

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,450
Centipede Shoes

22
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,420
It's a bomb... It's a bomb Stand!

23
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,060
So this is how it got Shigechi?

24
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,510
That's why we couldn't find him,
no matter where we looked.

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,740
He's... He's getting away!

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't go after him, Koichi.

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,290
Huh? Don't go after him?

28
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,810
What are you saying?

29
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,440
If we go after him,

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,230
we'll get to see the face of the person
who killed Reimi and Shigechi!

31
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,610
We need to cautiously
observe and act, Koichi.

32
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,770
Wh-What are you talking about?

33
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,740
We just happened to miss the
name tag on that jacket.

34
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,970
But considering how big the jacket was,

35
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,680
we can tell that the guy's
about 175 centimeters tall.

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,580
He's an office employee, and not married.

37
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,920
If he had a wife,

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,510
he wouldn't have brought his
jacket here for a button repair.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,720
He's between the ages of 25 and 35,
and he looks pretty rich.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,680
Judging from the material and design,
that jacket was a high-end brand.

41
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,200
Even if we don't follow him now,

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
we've significantly narrowed
down who it might be.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,630
I-I see...

44
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,740
W-Wait! That doesn't mean
we shouldn't go after him!

45
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,400
He's a murderer!

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,430
It's not that I don't want to
pursue him, but we can't.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,830
Because that bomb Stand
is somewhere over there.

48
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,450
Huh?! The Stand?

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,990
Y-You saw it?

50
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,560
I didn't see it, but it must be there.

51
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,000
Slowly walk outside through the door.

52
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,080
It "must be"? Hang on.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,010
How can you know it must
be there if you can't see it?

54
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,880
If he were the kind of guy to leave right
after getting rid of the shop owner,

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,370
then he never could've kept getting
away with killing for fifteen years.

56
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,550
He's someone who gets rid of all evidence.

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,740
Which means he plans to get rid of us.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Hold on a sec... Aren't you being too cautious?

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,510
If the Stand isn't here,

60
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,690
the murderer must be far away
with that jacket by now.

61
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,920
Listen up, Koichi.

62
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,420
Observing doesn't simply mean to look.
It means to look carefully.

63
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,080
Look

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,240
Look
Carefully

65
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,430
It doesn't mean to just
listen, but to listen well.

66
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,820
Listen

67
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,860
Listen
Well

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,080
Otherwise,

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,430
we're going to die.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,940
H-He's sounding high-and-mighty,
but my Reverb isn't useless.

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,690
It's matured a lot, so isn't
Jotaro underestimating me a bit?

72
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,810
I wonder if the bomb Stand
is really still around.

73
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,920
If it's not, we're gonna look really stupid!

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Look over here.

75
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,580
I-It's really here!

76
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,620
I-If I keep touching it, it'll explode!

77
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,960
Star Platinum!

78
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,770
After all those hits I landed...
This thing's pretty hard.

79
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,940
It's going to explode!

80
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,320
Star Platinum! The World!

81
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,670
I hate doing anything that's tiring,
so I'm going to destroy you now.

82
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,640
Y-Yes! You must have stopped time.

83
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,640
Now no matter how much we
touch it, it won't explode!

84
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,570
I will make sure the people searching for me

85
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,770
die in an explosion.

86
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,580
My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack
always gets its prey, no matter what.

87
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,360
I-Impossible! It wasn't destroyed
by Star Platinum's power!

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,960
A-A Stand that's this hard... Impossible!

89
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,480
Stay back, Koichi.

90
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,850
It's still perfectly fine!
It hasn't slowed down at all!

91
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,600
Get back, Koichi!

92
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,210
Y-You've hit it so much that you're hurt,

93
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,540
but it hasn't sustained any damage!

94
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,340
Get further back, Koichi!

95
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,630
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

96
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,450
What are you doing?!

97
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,310
It'll explode if you're touching it!
Let it go, quickly!

98
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,090
Look over here.

99
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,360
Good grief. I've never met
such a sturdy Stand.

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,750
I think my confidence is going to break first.

101
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,820
J-Jotaro, at this rate,
it's going to blow us up!

102
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,590
You need to get further away.

103
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,890
This time, I'm going to take it apart for sure.

104
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,860
I-I'd like to say something.

105
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,820
A Stand controlled from far away

106
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,100
doesn't move with that much power.

107
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,430
But that thing's power and explosive attacks...

108
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,600
The power behind those explosions wouldn't
be possible if the user wasn't nearby.

109
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,340
The user should be within fifteen...
no, ten meters of here!

110
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,350
And?

111
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,680
"And"?! It's ten meters!

112
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,900
My Reverb has a range of fifty meters!

113
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,370
It can find the culprit!

114
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,230
I told you, Koichi. Don't go after him.

115
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,820
You just need to think about protecting
yourself with your Reverb.

116
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,520
Don't do anything else.

117
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,380
Wh-Why?!

118
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,370
The culprit is no longer nearby.

119
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,590
This is a remotely controlled Stand.

120
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,200
I've had many encounters with
various Stands, so I know.

121
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,890
Look over here.

122
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,400
Its actions are too simple for it
to be controlled from nearby.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
You know from experience?

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,240
That's not logical at all!

125
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,590
There's no way a Stand that powerful
can be controlled from far away.

126
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,820
The user has to be close by!

127
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,230
So Jotaro really is underestimating me.

128
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,350
I've grown, too!

129
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,250
I can find the culprit and defeat him, too!

130
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,630
Distance, ten meters.

131
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,010
H-He's there! That's him! He has the jacket!

132
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,120
But something's weird...
H-He's too far away.

133
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,560
He's more than fifty meters away...

134
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,470
And he's only getting further away.

135
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,560
He's outside Reverb's range!

136
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,610
Th-The bomb Stand is being
controlled from far away?

137
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,640
That's impossible!

138
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,420
Having that power and being
that far away is inconceivable!

139
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,540
Look over here!

140
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,790
Wh-What? It's heading toward me?!

141
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,890
I figured it out.

142
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,670
That Stand goes after things
with higher temperatures first.

143
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,160
That's why it's so powerful,
despite being controlled from far away.

144
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,540
Bring out Reverb and protect yourself!

145
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,790
Even if I stop time, you're too far away!

146
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,310
C-Crap!

147
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,810
Reverb is...

148
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,970
fifty meters away, where the culprit is!

149
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm sorry!

150
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,690
Good grief.

151
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,700
Star Platinum! The World!

152
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,710
The reason this thing attacked
the shop owner first

153
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,490
was because he had a hot drink.

154
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,280
And it targeted Koichi because

155
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,580
his body temperature rose
from being so worked up.

156
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,850
If there's something hotter,
it should go toward that.

157
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,050
Time has begun to move again.

158
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,170
I was right.

159
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,320
It goes after things with the
highest temperature first.

160
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,070
I'm saved...

161
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,790
But if body temperature is
enough to make it explode,

162
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,450
then when it's near fire...

163
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,070
This power...

164
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,330
Huh?!

165
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,920
Jotaro!

166
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,350
H

167
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,430
He

168
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:50,520
Hea

169
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,600
Hear

170
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,730
Heart

171
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:50,810
Heart A

172
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:50,890
Heart Att

173
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:50,980
Heart Atta

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,060
Heart Attac

175
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
Heart Attack

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,730
Yoshi

177
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:51,810
Yoshikage

178
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:51,940
Yoshikage Ki

179
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,980
Yoshikage Kira

180
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,530
How could this happen?
This is all my fault, Jotaro!

181
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,280
This happened because I went after the culprit.

182
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,830
If he hadn't caused the fire for my
sake, it wouldn't have gotten him!

183
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,040
Wake up, Jotaro!

184
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,360
Jotaro! Jotaro!

185
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,880
That explosion wasn't a human!

186
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,750
Look over here.

187
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,380
It's going to deal the final blow!

188
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,570
It's too strong!

189
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,140
It's just like Jotaro said!

190
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,500
It'll attack something that's hotter
than body temperature first.

191
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Look over here.

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,610
I have to take this chance to run!

193
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,760
I want to call Josuke.

194
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,390
He'll fix Jotaro!

195
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,510
I have to call him!

196
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,140
This is... the kitchen!

197
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,060
There's plenty of heat here!

198
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,020
I need to buy some time
and run out that door.

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,400
There's a phone!

200
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,600
W-Wait a sec! It's not a gas stove!

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,250
Why does this house have an electric stove?!

202
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,340
It's going to take some time to warm up!

203
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,170
The oven's electric, too!

204
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,340
Wh-What should I...

205
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,670
I know! There should be some hot water.

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,670
Go over there!

207
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,220
It's empty!

208
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,520
Look over here.

209
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,010
Wait. If I observe carefully, like Jotaro said...

210
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,580
This thing has a weakness!

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,130
A weakness I didn't notice earlier!

212
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,570
And I'm starting to get pissed off.

213
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,710
Why do I have to regretfully run away

214
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,600
in fear from a murderer, like,
"Please, God, save me"?

215
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,480
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

216
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,450
Why do I have to think that I'd rather

217
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,690
be looking for a public restroom while

218
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,250
I have diarrhea if I could only get
out of this situation safely?

219
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,610
Isn't something wrong?

220
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,870
The one who should be
running away in fear...

221
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,790
is you, murderer!

222
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,250
It always attacks based on temperature...

223
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,680
But that's exactly what your weakness is!

224
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,340
The fact that you never give up
on that is your weakness!

225
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,640
It's been almost three minutes.

226
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,280
I don't know what's going
on at that shoe store,

227
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,900
but there's one thing I can say with
more faith than anything in this world.

228
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,860
Heart Attack has no weaknesses.

229
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,400
It'll track down its target, no matter what.

230
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,780
Now, then... Since that's over with,
I have to call Josuke on the phone.

231
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,660
He should be home now...

232
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,670
Sizzle

233
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,470
Now that thing's lost track of us.

234
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,680
Keep chasing after the word "sizzle" forever...

235
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,410
Just like a donkey chasing after a
carrot hanging in front of its face.

236
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,250
That's what your weakness is.

237
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,690
Hello, Higashikata residence.

238
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,570
Josuke, this is Koichi! There's trouble!

239
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,780
Jotaro is hurt bad, and it's my fault.
Please hurry and get here!

240
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,440
What?! Don't say that so suddenly!

241
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,900
I don't get what you're talking about!

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,480
Just hurry up and get over here.
It finally happened!

243
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,310
We encountered the murderer!

244
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,600
I've captured his Stand here.

245
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,670
What did you capture?!

246
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,800
Say it so I can understand! Where are you?

247
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,080
Wh-What's happening?

248
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,830
Ow, hot! I turned it off, but now
it's getting hotter and hotter.

249
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,740
What's with this piece of crap?

250
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,200
How can you cook anything good with this?!

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,110
Hey! I'm asking you where you are, Koichi!

252
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,510
Look over here.

253
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,490
Crap! It's ignoring the
letters and coming this way!

254
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,200
Koichi, where are you?
Hurry up and tell me, you dumbass!

255
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,870
I'm at Centipede Shoes! Hurry!

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,540
Crap, Reverb's tail letters also...

257
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,220
Reverb's tail letters got destroyed!

258
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,640
The damage...

259
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,350
That explosion wasn't a human.

260
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,280
Look over here.

261
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,060
A-Again! It's coming after me again.

262
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,710
But I can't use the tail letters anymore.

263
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,320
Wh-What am I going to do?

264
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,360
How can I fight it?

265
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,580
Reverb Act 2!

266
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,790
What's wrong, Reverb Act 2?!

267
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,540
Act 2!

268
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,020
Where are you, Act 2?!
Why won't you come?!

269
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,770
Act 2 was killed in the explosion!

270
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,940
It's split in two!

271
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,710
N-No, wait...

272
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,950
If the explosion killed it, I'd be
dead too, because I'm the user.

273
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,790
N-Now I remember! It looked
like Reverb died once before, too.

274
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,760
A-And then...

275
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,420
C-Could it be...

276
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,800
Boooom

277
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,930
Reverb Act 3!

278
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,930
Um, is that who you are, sir?

279
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,430
Please give me orders.

280
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,110
D-Does this mean I've grown?!

281
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,070
You're amazing, Act 3!

282
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,590
Please give me orders.

283
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,570
Er, I don't know what your
powers are, so... F-For now...

284
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,580
Please protect us, Act 3!

285
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,460
Um, protect us, please.
You can do that, right?

286
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,090
Understood.

287
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,690
Dogyan

288
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,380
This air pressure!

289
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,010
Th-This Stand has incredible speed!

290
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,930
It has way more speed than Act 1 and Act 2!

291
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Snap

292
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Special move: Reverb Act 3 Freeze!

293
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,950
Kerbam Bam

294
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,080
Kerbam Bam

295
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,540
Crash

296
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,110
H-Hey, Act 3?!

297
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,110
It's too strong. I can't.

298
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,530
You can't?!

299
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,800
This enemy has a seriously heavy power.

300
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,030
S-H-I-T.

301
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,810
I pushed, but I lost.

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,700
You pushed and lost? You can't be serious!

303
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,810
I'm telling you to protect us!

304
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,610
I have finished protecting us,

305
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,320
just like you ordered.

306
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,570
Look over here.

307
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,910
You finished?! In what way?!

308
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,080
You're completely useless!
We haven't grown at all!

309
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,340
Look over he—

310
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,470
Wh-What?

311
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,640
This is taking far too long.

312
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,380
Why is Heart Attack taking so long?

313
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Wh-What's going on? My left hand just...

314
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,430
My left hand that released
Heart Attack just suddenly...

315
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,130
Sir, what's wrong? Are you all right?

316
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,220
Oh, it's nothing.
Allow me to pay for the cup.

317
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,170
I'll be leaving, so can I get my check?

318
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,170
Th-This is...

319
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,420
M-My left hand... is heavy!

320
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,670
S-Sir?

321
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,970
I-Impossible! My left hand! My left hand...

322
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,130
It feels like there's a 40
or 50 kilogram weight on it.

323
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,480
What's going on over there?

324
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,570
Sir, are you all right?

325
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,270
D-Don't mind me.

326
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,270
Please, allow me to give you a hand.

327
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,270
It's heavy!

328
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,030
What are you doing, sir? How could you?

329
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,950
It's sunken into the pavement
and having a hard time moving...

330
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,290
Act 3! What did you do? This power...

331
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,780
3 Freeze!

332
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,290
I've rhymed "three" and "free."

333
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,350
Act 3, what is this power?

334
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,480
Why is it moving slower? Tell me.

335
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,550
There's really nothing to explain about it.

336
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,100
It's heavy...

337
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,850
For whatever reason,
Heart Attack has gotten heavy.

338
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,930
This isn't good. I need to retrieve it.

339
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,590
I have to go retrieve Heart Attack myself.
