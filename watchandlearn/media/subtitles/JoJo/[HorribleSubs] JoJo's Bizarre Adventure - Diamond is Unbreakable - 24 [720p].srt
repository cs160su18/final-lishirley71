2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,600
Doing things that bring attention to myself...

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,290
That is what I, Yoshikage Kira, hate the most.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,170
And to think that I'm experiencing this
humiliation in front of total strangers...

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,380
To think that the invincible auto-pilot
Heart Attack would get caught...

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,550
Damn... I have to undo this spell somehow...

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,200
Hey, mister. You okay?

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,170
You sick or something?

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,750
Want me to call your mommy?

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,270
It's nothing. Get lost.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,060
Hey, hey, hey, did you hear that?

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,660
You seeing some sweet dreams during the
day after drinking too much, mister?

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,110
Is it fun? Does it feel good?

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,850
Grasp

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,970
That's a nice suit you've got on.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,900
We've been fired and don't have any money.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,620
We can't even get any bitches.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,250
Seeing guys like you piss me off.

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,760
At least try to defend yourself.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,390
Hey, mister. Your shoelaces are untied.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,050
I'll tie them for you.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,100
A square knot! That's super nice of you!

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,640
H-Hey, what's wrong?

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,260
Deadly Queen's first bomb.

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,710
It turns anything it touches into a bomb.

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,120
Th-The doctor! Call the doctor!

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,970
What a terrible day.

28
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,230
Get me a doctor!

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,520
I just want to live a quiet life,

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,800
and yet I had to deal with those
two pieces of trash today...

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,700
Diamond is Unbreakable

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,700
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,460
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,460
Diamond is Unbreakable

35
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,250
Episode 24     Heart Attack, Part 2

36
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,460
Hey, Josuke.

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,020
What the heck happened at Centipede Shoes?

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,480
I don't really know, but it wasn't good.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,400
Hurry! It'll take about five minutes.

40
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,950
There are cracks in it.

41
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,770
That means the actual Stand's
been damaged, too, right?

42
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,830
Please don't go too far away from me.

43
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,910
My range is five meters.

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,310
Act 3's is five meters.

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,610
We have matured.

46
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,820
We're even more powerful now.

47
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,250
It can't be helped that my
range is shorter than Act 2's.

48
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:18,270
5 Meters

49
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,940
If you move more than five meters from me,

50
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,620
Gravity

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,670
the weight on that thing will disappear.

52
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,280
It'll stop struggling and regain its vigor,

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,900
and rush toward us like a dog in heat.

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,530
On the other hand, the closer you get to it,

55
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,480
the heavier I can make it.

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,900
What would you like to do?

57
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,580
N-No... This distance is plenty.

58
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,280
I hope Josuke gets here soon.

59
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,850
Apparently, a gym will be opening
near Budogaoka High School soon.

60
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,940
I was really considering
getting a membership.

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,910
I have to gain more stamina.

62
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,050
But I wonder if I'll be
lifting the same dumbbells

63
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,360
who've been playing with their dicks
after not bathing for a week,

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,090
or getting in the same pool with them.

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,880
It took me three minutes to get here.

66
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,380
I felt my lack of stamina the most
when I tried to cross at the crosswalk.

67
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,260
By the way, who's going to show up here?

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,430
You called someone for help, didn't you?

69
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,890
Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu
Nijimura live the closest.

70
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,830
It'll take them about five minutes,
so two minutes to go?

71
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,740
You're their friend, aren't you?

72
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,620
H-H...

73
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,530
Yukako Yamagishi and the woman

74
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,960
who runs Salon Cinderella are also
what you call Stand users, aren't they?

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,290
You wouldn't actually call
a lady for help, would you?

76
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,620
H-He's...

77
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,220
I left my jacket with the button behind.

78
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,170
I'll go get it later...

79
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,460
After I'm done with you.

80
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,510
H-He's... right in front of me!

81
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,500
This man...

82
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,600
The one who killed all those people
over all those years...

83
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,560
And Reimi and Shigechi...

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,370
Let him have it, Act 3!

85
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,930
Dogyuun

86
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,530
Deadly Queen!

87
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,000
Why does he have two Stands?

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,170
I thought a user could only have one Stand!

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,170
Heart Attack is a tracer bomb that was
launched from Deadly Queen's left hand.

90
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,180
That's why the damage
is only in my left hand.

91
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,380
Warning, Sir Koichi.

92
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,690
You have just left my range of five meters.

93
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,820
The bomb Stand's weight will disappear.

94
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,780
S-h-i-t. I'll have to attack
it with 3 Freeze again.

95
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,270
I see... Range, eh?

96
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,820
Who would you like me to hit?

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,420
The actual murderer,
or that shitty bomb Stand?

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,090
3 Freeze cannot make two
things heavy at once.

99
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,080
Even if we make the user heavier,

100
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,850
the bomb Stand is on
auto-pilot, so it won't stop.

101
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,350
Even if we make the bomb heavier,
the user will come after me.

102
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,520
Which will it be?

103
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,310
Please hurry and give me orders.

104
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,360
Which one are you going to attack?

105
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,650
S-Stop the bomb!

106
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,340
3 Freeze!

107
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,900
Ker-bam-bam

108
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,040
It appears that, no matter who you attacked,
you were still fated to lose.

109
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,410
However, to think that Heart Attack,
which I thought had no weak points,

110
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,120
would be completely useless...

111
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,260
I had to pay some expenses at the café,

112
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,080
then ended up in a scuffle with some
hooligans. I feel like I've been had.

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,620
This is the first time

114
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,450
I've ever felt so cornered.

115
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,480
I even feel a slight sense of defeat.

116
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,820
Goodness. I must show you some respect.

117
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,570
You're rather impressive.

118
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,700
By the way, do you have any pocket tissues?

119
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,450
A handkerchief would work, too.

120
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,400
Hm? I've shown you some respect.

121
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,960
The least you can do is talk to me.

122
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,430
I don't... have any.

123
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,270
Then, here. Use mine.

124
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,140
A lot of blood is coming from your nose, right?

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,730
It's just so you can wipe that off.

126
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,570
I'm about to beat you to death.

127
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,480
I have a little over a minute
before your friends get here.

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,910
Otherwise, I just won't be satisfied after
having to face such humiliation in public.

129
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,910
Now, now, stop screaming
in such a weird way.

130
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,610
I endured the same pain you feel now

131
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,980
as I was heading over here, but I didn't scream.

132
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,760
You're a boy, aren't you?

133
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,510
You should take after me.

134
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,580
See? You need some tissues now, don't you?

135
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll wipe it for you.

136
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,270
They say your brain slows down
when your nose is stuffed up.

137
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:57,150
But you know, I was on the ground
a little while ago, too, just like you.

138
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,230
I'll blow you away with
Deadly Queen in another minute.

139
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,100
Until then, you need to be like
me and just endure the pain.

140
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,510
You need to be like me!

141
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,930
Y-Your name...

142
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,790
is Yoshikage Kira...

143
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,730
Yoshikage Kira is your real name...

144
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,310
My driver's license!

145
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,780
When did you take it out of my wallet?

146
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,080
You little brat...

147
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,730
You said you paid some expenses
at the café earlier, right?

148
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,660
That's when I had an idea.

149
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,560
So what?

150
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,140
What do you gain from knowing my name?

151
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,170
You're about to be erased.

152
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,570
Yeah, you're about to kill me.

153
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,670
But even I was able to figure out your name.

154
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,980
You're not that big a deal.

155
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,060
You might get away for now,
but how do you feel?

156
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,150
A little brat like me managed
to find out what your name was.

157
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,010
I'll say it again.

158
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,410
A little brat found you out!

159
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
You're a complete idiot!

160
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,840
I'll be looking forward to
seeing you in the next world!

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,420
You bastard!

162
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,960
Damn it! What is this sense of defeat?!

Koichi Hirose

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,210
What an infuriating little brat.

176
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,810
I still have a minute before
Josuke and Okuyasu show up.

177
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,410
And I was trying to beat the crap
out of him to calm myself down.

178
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,750
He's got his socks on inside-out.

179
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,910
Doesn't that bug him?

180
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,790
Ugh, it sure bugs me!

181
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,940
Not that way, Okuyasu!

182
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,660
But Centipede Shoes is this way.

183
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,240
If we go this way, we'll get
there in a minute! Hurry up!

184
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,640
Wear them properly.

185
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,000
Now I can finally relax.

186
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,570
And now I can blow you to kingdom come!

187
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,570
Deadly Queen!

188
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,410
The tip of this finger can
turn anything into a bomb.

189
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,290
I guess, in your case, I'll make
your student badge a bomb.

190
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,420
The first bomb!

191
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,880
Koichi, you were winning against
that man psychologically.

192
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,250
What?!

193
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,100
Well, this is a surprise.

194
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,540
I never thought you'd be able
to stand with those wounds...

195
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,900
However, you would have been much
better off if you had stayed down.

196
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,500
I can almost see the view behind
you through your wounds.

197
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,840
That's a nice watch.

198
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,660
But I'll break it so you can never
see the time on it again...

199
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,210
By that, I mean I'll break your face.

200
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,210
You seem like quite an interesting fellow.

201
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,770
I'd love to learn your name,
as well as various other things,

202
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,220
but I must take my leave.

203
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,760
I only have twenty seconds left.

204
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,980
I don't have time for idle chit-chat.

205
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,870
Your Stand just now was very weak.

206
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,250
I was easily able to catch it, like a pop-up.

207
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,700
Do you really think you can defeat
my Deadly Queen with so little power?

208
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,610
Smash

209
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,640
Wh—

210
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,170
H-He's fast...

211
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,250
Wh-What's with this speed?

212
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,470
Upon closer inspection...
Good grief, what an ugly watch.

213
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,970
But you won't have to worry
about that anymore...

214
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,350
Because your face is going to end up

215
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,480
even uglier.

216
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,740
What is this Stand?

217
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,870
It's so fast, it's like it stopped time!

218
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,340
Koichi, if it weren't for you,
I would have been dead.

219
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,320
You did well fighting all by yourself.

220
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,220
You have my respect, Koichi.

221
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,340
You've matured.

222
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Hey, Koichi!

223
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
Koichi!

224
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,210
Wh-What the heck happened here?

225
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,630
K-Koichi! Jotaro!

226
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,260
Be careful, Okuyasu.

227
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,110
What the heck happened?! Jotaro! Koichi!

228
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,670
Calm down. I need to find out
if Koichi is alive or not.

229
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,570
If he's alive, I can fix his
wounds with Shining Diamond.

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,480
Yes! Jotaro is alive! Just barely, though.

231
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,270
K-Koichi's alive, too.
But he's not breathing!

232
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,830
Hurry! Hurry up and fix him, Josuke!

233
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,160
Hey, he's not waking up at all!

234
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,580
But I've already fixed him up.

235
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,490
This is awful... Josuke and Okuyasu are here.

236
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,370
He's hurt really bad!

237
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,210
It's gonna take a while for
him to regain consciousness.

238
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,820
What a day... I've never had
such an awful day in my life.

239
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,840
I have always been able to
get through any dilemma...

240
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm going to get away, no matter what.

241
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,890
What are you doing?

242
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,240
Hey, he's awake.

243
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,360
Hey, don't try anything funny.

244
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,510
Turn this way slowly. Show us your face!

245
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,240
Be careful! Don't go to Centipede Shoes!

246
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,830
There's going to be some crazy explosion!

247
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,010
The owner just suddenly came flying out!

248
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,210
Those two, too!

249
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,790
An explosion?

250
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,050
H-Hey, calm down. Were you caught in the blast?

251
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,770
I'm just an office employee.

252
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,810
But now I'm going to die...
Look at all this blood.

253
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,740
I-It hurts!

254
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,240
H-Hey, calm down. It's all right now.

255
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,150
I'll patch you up.

256
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,220
Where did you get hurt?

257
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,110
I think one of my ribs might
have punctured my lung.

258
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,060
H-Hurry up and fix me, please!

259
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,740
Hurry?

260
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,690
Oh? No matter how you look at me,
I just look like a high school student,

261
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,590
so why would you ask me to fix you?

262
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,140
I have trouble just getting
into pachinko parlors,

263
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,260
yet I look like some doctor who
graduated from med school to you?

264
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,470
You totally fell for it.

265
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,520
You saw my Shining Diamond, didn't you?

266
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,270
Crap... I got too impatient.

267
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,360
Which means you're the enemy.

268
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,110
This was a draw.

269
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,240
Th-This guy's the murderer?!

270
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,840
I guess this means I've lost.

271
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,370
Yes, the one you're all looking for is me.

272
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,790
My face has been seen,
my Stand has been seen,

273
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,930
and my name has been discovered.

274
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,130
It appears I won't be able to
sleep peacefully anymore...

275
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,640
But only tonight!

276
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,140
Deadly Queen!

277
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,940
What the hell are you doing?!

278
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,770
Exactly what it looks like. I cut it off.

279
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,740
I-It hurts... It's so painful,
and I'm bleeding a lot.

280
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,570
I'm even crying.

281
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,380
But winning or losing means nothing to me.

282
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm going to survive.

283
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,430
I'm going to survive in peace.

284
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,830
I have to live with the fate of being
unable to fight the urge to kill people,

285
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,750
but I will live happily!

286
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,720
Heart Attack, you are free!

287
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,480
I leave the rest to you.

288
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,550
Protect me.

289
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,890
What the hell is that wimpy-looking thing?

290
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,810
Josuke, that's a bomb Stand
that goes after body heat!

291
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,690
And it won't break!

292
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,690
It's going to explode in reaction
to your body temperature!

293
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,400
It won't break?

294
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
Break?

295
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,930
You've got it backwards. I fixed it.

296
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,250
If that guy left it behind...

297
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,050
This is a pretty gross idea, but that
hand is heading toward the murderer.

298
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,880
Let's go after it!

299
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,210
Yeah!

300
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,700
You're not getting away that easily, dumbass!

301
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,350
H-Hey, look at that...

302
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,850
Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully...

303
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,980
K-Kira? Why is your face all bloody?

304
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,740
Hello, everyone. Is it
already time to head home?

305
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,370
I'm in a hurry, so I'll be seeing you.

306
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
The murderer's name is Yoshikage Kira.

307
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,890
His address is Morioh Kotodai 1-128.

308
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,420
He's 33 years old.

309
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,000
His Stand is a short-ranged
bomb Stand, Deadly Queen!

310
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,140
Hey, where is that guy headed?

311
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,570
It doesn't matter where
he's headed. He's finished!

312
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,680
He's in this building.

313
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,270
Hey, wait... This is...

314
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,720
Salon Cinderella!

315
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,480
What's he doing here?!

316
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,530
A-Aya! Are you here?

317
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,820
Dr. Aya Tsuji!

318
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,630
A-Aya's...

319
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,380
Aya's...

320
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,840
What is this? What the hell is this?!

321
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,850
He's dead... Why is Yoshikage Kira dead?

322
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,370
Aya!

323
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,820
Th-This is...

324
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,440
What the hell happened?

325
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,860
Wait! That man isn't Yoshikage Kira!
He has his left hand!

326
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,110
Huh?

327
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,370
He d-doesn't have a face!

328
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,300
What?!

329
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,200
He's missing his fingerprints on his
right hand, too. Who is this guy?

330
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,480
Guy...

331
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,710
He's wearing the same suit...

332
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,220
He brought in that guy,
and killed him in front of me.

333
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,370
He's too terrifying...

334
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,290
He made me switch his face using Cinderella.

335
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,100
And his hair and fingerprints, by force...

336
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,310
So he's someone else now?

337
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,440
Yes...

338
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,360
H-His face...

339
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,560
Shining Diamond!

340
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,430
H-His...

341
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,510
Josuke, don't touch her! Get away from there!

342
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,540
His face...

343
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
Aya!

344
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,800
On the other side of that door!

345
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,970
You're not getting away, damn it!

346
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,390
Th-This is...

347
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,660
I-It's time for everyone to go home...

348
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,480
S-So many...

349
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,150
Wh-Which one is he?
Which one is Yoshikage Kira?!

350
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,050
Yoshikage Kira, you coward! Show yourself!

351
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,410
He managed to get away.

352
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,490
He's not going to be quivering, or hiding.

353
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,500
He's not even going to leave Morioh.

354
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,600
He's going to live his life in
this town, like he always has.

355
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,850
Aya Tsuji: dead.

356
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,380
Aya Tsuji: Dead

357
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,380

358

and address, becoming a different person.
