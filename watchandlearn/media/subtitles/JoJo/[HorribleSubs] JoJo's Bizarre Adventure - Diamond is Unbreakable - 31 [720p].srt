July 12th (Mon) 5:05 PM

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
Yoshikage... My son...

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,440
Where are you right now?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,470
I'm sure you've probably changed your
face and name, and have hidden yourself.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,790
How pitiful...  And yet...

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,620
Right. We need to find out about any
people who've gone missing recently.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,440
Including those considered runaways.

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,760
Kira is probably hiding.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,610
Do you think he'd commit
murders again in that state?

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,010
Serial killers like him can't easily
keep their impulses in check.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,980
He will strike again.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,170
Are you sure we don't need to do anything?

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,740
We haven't been able to find
a single clue about Kira yet.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,970
That's what I was thinking, too.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,780
But Jotaro said it was fine.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,310
He said he'll have us move
when he finds something out,

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,730
but until then, he wants us
to continue being students.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,790
I'd rather look for Kira than study.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,540
We managed to corner him that one time,

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,530
so it should be pretty easy, shouldn't it?

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,050
Kisara
Drug

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,090
Yes. As long as I'm repairing my house,
I'd like to do some renovations, too.

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,840
Curses! He's actually taking pictures
of everyone to try to find him!

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,390
I guess I'll have someone come
by to give me an estimate.

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,440
Jotaro and all of his other Stand
users are doing whatever they want...

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,570
I need to make a new Stand user

28
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,950
to take care of those meddlesome bastards...

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,950
Hm?

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,310
That's...

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,870
There's no doubt about it!

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,670
Even though his appearance has changed,

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,610
our bond as father and
son bring us together.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,250
There's no way I would mistake my own son!

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,970
I've found you, Yoshikage...

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,890
I'm gonna find out

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,850
who the guy disguised as my dad really is.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,350
It can't be...

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,410
At this rate, those Stand users will...

40
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,610
I won't allow it!
I won't allow that to happen!

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,990
I will protect Yoshikage!

42
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,670
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

43
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,670
Diamond is Unbreakable

44
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,610
July 15th (Thurs) 7:50 AM

45
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm heading out.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,330
I'm gonna be late...
And I've got class duties today!

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,850
Episode 31    July 15th (Thurs), Part 1

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,470
July 15th (Thurs), 8:02 AM

49
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,030
So tired...

50
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,300
I stayed up way too late last night.

51
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,620
I got plenty of sleep, so I'm
in top shape again today.

52
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,020
Look, Josuke.

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,000
Binoculars.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
There's a pair of binoculars on the ground.

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,390
You're so easily intrigued by
things that are on the ground.

56
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,050
Don't pick them up. They're dirty.

57
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,800
What? Really?

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,990
I am not dirty!

59
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,370
Hello, Josuke and Okuyasu.

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,670
I-It was you? Don't scare
us like that, Mikitaka.

61
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,890
You're gonna give me a heart attack, damn it!

62
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,470
Oh, stop...

63
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,340
Don't get bashful.
It's not a compliment!

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,590
Though, yeah... You showed up at a good time.

65
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,190
There's something I wanted
to get straightened out.

66
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,960
The thing about you being
an alien is a lie, right?

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,020
You're just a Stand user who
thinks he's an alien, right?

68
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,100
Stop being ambiguous and
clear things up, damn it!

69
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,220
I have been clear from the beginning.

70
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,910
I am an alien.

71
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,480
Why are you talking like
that all of a sudden?

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
That's enough.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,720
More importantly, what are you doing,

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,230
turning into binoculars
on the road like that?

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,040
Oh, yes. I wanted you two
to look at that thing,

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,910
so I was waiting here for you.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,530
That thing?

78
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,190
That thing... The electrical
pylon right in front of you.

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,170
Electrical pylon?

80
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,970
That's not really an electrical pylon.

81
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,470
It's a remnant stripped of its
wires that's no longer in use.

82
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,890
When construction started on
Morioh's residential areas,

83
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,010
most of the cables got put underground,
so these weren't needed anymore.

84
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,210
What about it?

85
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,190
Are you trying to communicate
with some other planet?

86
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,430
There's smoke coming out of the
middle of that pylon, isn't there?

87
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,010
Huh?

88
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,860
Y-You're right...

89
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,730
Please take a good look at it.

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
H-Hey, it's a kettle!

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,590
What? In a place like that?!

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,800
It's, like, 20 meters off the ground!

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,470
Would you mind taking a look
about five meters higher?

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,060
What the heck is that?

95
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,390
L-Let me see, too.

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,130
There! There he is!

97
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,550
There's a guy up there! He's cooking!

98
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,540
What?! Let me see!

99
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,930
He must be living on that pylon.

100
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,600
He's actually making a living there!

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
He's fishing from the river,
and even has cucumbers growing.

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,330
That's really convenient!

103
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,930
I see! So it's basically a
self-sufficient dwelling.

104
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,840
Some people in this world
do very strange things.

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
Look out!

106
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,440
H-He's...

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,710
It's a new Stand user!

108
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,200
Yeah! I just saw him fly!

109
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,790
But what's a Stand user
doing living up there?

110
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,530
It would seem there's a need to
find out more about that man.

111
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,680
I can see them... They're finally here.

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,470
Are they interested in me?

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Come on over.

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,970
It's been a while since
I've spoken to other people.

115
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,410
Look. It looks like he sees us, too.

116
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,070
Want to go over there?

117
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,470
Yeah, but be careful.

118
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,980
We still don't know if that
Stand user is a friend or foe.

119
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,890
July 15th (Thurs)  8:05 AM

120
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,880
Huh? D-Do you need something?

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,030
I'm in a bit of a hurry right... now...

122
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,080
Huh? Huh?!

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,240
July 15th (Thurs)  8:11 AM

124
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,470
Looking at it up close,
it's bigger than I thought.

125
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,390
You guys, stop right there!

126
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,720
Don't come any closer to this pylon.

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,470
Huh?

128
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,800
Move back a bit more.

129
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,310
I just relieved myself, so you need
to step back, or you'll be in trouble.

130
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,820
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,210
D-Don't tell me this is...

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,620
I told you so.

133
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,470
You'll get covered in feces and urine!

134
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,430
That's gross!

135
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,630
Gross? How rude!

136
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,040
I made it spray like that so I could
fertilize the wildflowers over there!

137
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,960
I like to recycle everything I possibly can.

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,240
On the right are Asiatic dayflowers,
mountain udo, and watercress.

139
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,720
They're all edible wildflowers!

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,890
Not to mention, if there
are wildflowers around,

141
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,770
I can catch wild rabbits
that come to eat them,

142
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,470
so it's killing two birds with one stone.

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,810
So you really are living up there?

144
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,070
Doesn't this pylon belong
to the electric company?

145
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,160
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,570
This is my house that I
bought with my own money.

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,290
I bought this abandoned
pylon for 100,000 yen

148
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,780
and made it my own ideal
self-sufficient house!

149
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,110
Bought?

150
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,450
For 100,000 yen?

151
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,200
That's right. Just 100,000 yen.

152
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,720
Because I'm self-sufficient,
I don't have to work at any company.

153
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,640
And even if I never leave here, I get all the
exercise I need by moving around the pylon.

154
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,180
Take a look at this spectacular view.

155
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,360
Huh? W-Wait a minute.

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,100
Even if you never leave? Just how long
have you been living on this pylon?

157
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Let's see... About three years now?

158
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,720
Th...

159
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,060
Three years?!

160
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,280
I probably haven't touched
the ground in about a month.

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,730
H-Hey, Josuke. I had no idea that
an idiot like this lived in Morioh.

162
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,930
This guy isn't an enemy,
he's just a damn weirdo.

163
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,630
I don't think he's going to attack us.

164
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,840
True...

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,890
I guess, for now, we can just
head back and report to Jotaro.

166
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,750
But...

167
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,540
Something's still bugging me...

168
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,010
July 15th (Thurs)  10:15 AM

169
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,390
What's he doing?

170
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,720
Well, I guess kids take videos, too...

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,670
But since he's hiding behind that pillar,

172
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,650
it looks like he's doing the same thing I am.

173
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,110
He's following someone and
recording their actions...

174
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,410
Could he be recording someone here?

175
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,280
Hayato Kawajiri

176
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,500
"Hayato Kawajiri," huh...

177
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,170
There's something strange...

178
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,250
about this kid.

179
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,420
July 15th (Thurs)  7:33 AM

180
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm home.

181
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,930
Silence

182
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,530
That's strange.

183
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,940
Josuke, you haven't left for school yet?

184
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,690
Josuke!

185
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,370
I'm hungry.

186
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,480
Josuke, that bastard... This is so rude!

187
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,770
How dare he take a bite out of my favorite

188
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,180
Kamakura Custar and then put
it back in the fridge?!

189
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,690
Not to mention, there should have been two left.

190
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,440
That kid seriously pisses me off.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

192
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,770
Hey, something fell out of your pocket.

193
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,240
Is that a photograph?

194
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,990
Would you guys mind leaving now?

195
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,910
You don't have to pick it up.
I'll get it myself later.

196
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,880
It looks like a Polaroid.
What's he panicking for?

197
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,230
Seriously, it's okay! Just leave!

198
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,170
What?! You're...

199
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,380
Hey! J-J-Josuke!

200
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,250
You're Kira's dad!

201
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,930
I knew the ghost dad was involved in this!

202
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,470
So you've finally come in.
I've been waiting for this.

203
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,940
When you tell people to come in,
they become guarded and don't come in.

204
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,890
But if you tell people not to come in,
they get pissed off and come in.

205
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,910
You've finally stepped into
Superfly, Josuke Higashikata!

206
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,990
Wh-What?!

207
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,660
Well done, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

208
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,270
Well done luring that idiot
Josuke into Superfly!

209
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,370
I commend you!

210
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,360
Something's not right! Come back, Josuke!

211
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,530
No, Kira's dad is right there!
The arrow's right there!

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
You bastard!

213
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,380
Why, you—

214
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,200
What?!

215
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,740
You see, when someone enters this pylon,

216
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,690
they can't get out until
the next person comes in.

217
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,190
If they try to force their way out, they
become a part of the pylon themselves.

218
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,420
That's my Stand, Superfly!

219
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,870
You fell for it, Josuke Higashikata!

220
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,170
Don't let him get away, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

221
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,980
Josuke!

222
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,370
S

223
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:41,470
Su

224
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,570
Sup

225
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:41,670
Supe

226
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,770
Super

227
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:41,870
Superf

228
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:41,970
Superfl

229
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,960
Superfly

230
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:42,670
Toyo

231
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:42,750
Toyohiro

232
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:42,840
Toyohiro Kane

233
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:42,920
Toyohiro Kaneda

234
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,960
Toyohiro Kanedaichi

235
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
Josuke!

236
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,090
Damn it...

237
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,030
I said it was my Stand,

238
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,220
but Superfly isn't a Stand that I can control.

239
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,690
It's actually an independent Stand.

240
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,540
I can finally leave, now that
you guys have shown up.

241
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,990
Even I, its user, was held captive by Superfly.

242
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,490
Well, good luck living here in my stead!

243
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,540
That bastard!

244
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,480
He must've been working with
the guy in the photograph.

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,250
Okuyasu, is there anything that I can do?

246
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,620
You'll just get hurt, so stay out of it.

247
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,860
Your job's over.

248
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,520
If you could actually turn
into dynamite instead of

249
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,470
dice or binoculars and blow this
pylon up, things might be different.

250
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,710
That I cannot do.

251
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,480
I can't produce any strength
that isn't my own,

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,380
and I can't turn into anything
complicated like explosives.

253
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,310
But I'd like to be of some use.

254
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,630
Shut up.

255
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,390
I'm telling you that there's
nothing you can do.

256
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,650
Leave the dangerous stuff to us.

257
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,580
That bastard's starting to run
away because he's convinced

258
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,480
that he's got him trapped in there,

259
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,370
but he must not know who we are.

260
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,370
Hey. You gonna do this, Okuyasu?

261
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,910
I know you're up to it, too.

262
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,410
What's the big deal about this pylon?

263
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,380
Let's crush it, Josuke!

264
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,300
Yeah. There shouldn't be an
issue if I crush it and get out!

265
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,140
Watch it!

266
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,650
The hell? What's with their power?!

267
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,640
This thing's pretty sturdy.

268
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,470
But if we keep attacking it,
this pillar will snap in two.

269
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,030
And look. It looks like that
guy's about to fall off.

270
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,610
Y-You idiots! How can you
do something so terrifying?

271
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,320
Of course I thought about that possibility.

272
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,100
But haven't you noticed?

273
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,930
This pylon is draining your powers and

274
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,170
distributing them throughout itself.

275
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,080
Huh? What the hell is that idiot talking about?

276
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,360
Josuke, just a little more,
and you'll be out of there!

277
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,650
Here we go!

278
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,180
Hold up, Okuyasu. Listen.

279
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,440
Something's not right.
What's that weird sound?

280
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,830
It's the sound of all
the power you guys threw

281
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,470
into the pylon, moving throughout it.

282
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,320
What?

283
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,550
And think about this carefully.

284
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,600
You know that whole
"law of conservation of energy"?

285
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,330
Energy that's running around has to
be able to escape from somewhere.

286
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,340
So where's all that energy's gonna go?

287
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,910
It can't be...

288
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,790
Okuyasu, duck!

289
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,430
What?!

290
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,110
You can attack it all you want,

291
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,900
but all the attacks on the pylon are
just gonna come right back to you.

292
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,170
If you hit it, it'll hit back.
If you cut it, it'll cut back.

293
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,970
Just think about it.

294
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,910
No matter who comes around
with whatever kind of ability,

295
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,910
no one can destroy this pylon!

296
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,420
Okuyasu!

297
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,790
Th-This isn't good, Josuke...

298
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,620
I couldn't dodge it completely.

299
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,920
It ripped a hole in my side.

300
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,450
I guess I should've warned you about that.

301
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,890
And next, you're probably going to think

302
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,560
that if you defeat me, the user,
you'll be able to get out.

303
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,690
But that's futile, too.

304
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,790
This pylon is an independent Stand.

305
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,800
Even if I were to die,

306
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,890
this pylon would probably continue
to trap people inside for eternity.

307
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,070
That's what Superfly is.

308
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,960
Josuke...

309
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,080
For eternity?

310
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,170
But don't get too depressed about that.

311
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,360
You just have to lure someone
else in, Josuke Higashikata.

312
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,350
If one comes in, one can get out.

313
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,570
Just have some sucker take
your place and get out.

314
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,720
It's sort of like playing Old Maid.

315
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,830
It's like human society.

316
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,650
You just need to pass off the
old maid to someone else.

317
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,000
Am I wrong?

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,730
Indeed, if someone else is pulled in,
Josuke will be saved.

319
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,830
Huh?

320
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,980
What?

321
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,780
You should be the one to return,
then. Into the pylon...

322
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,320
you go.

323
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,080
You...

324
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,830
Mikitaka! When did you...

325
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,720
Who the hell are you?

326
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,080
Why were you an electrical wire?
When did you get there?

327
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,190
What the hell is that ability?

328
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,210
Why, thank you for asking.

329
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,180
You see, I'm an alien.

330
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
What?

331
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,680
Y-You actually can be useful!

332
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,660
Now's your chance.
Please step outside, Josuke-san.

333
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,890
Y-You bastard!

334
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,310
You have my praise, Mikitaka!

335
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,170
Josuke, hurry up and get out.

336
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,110
Get out of the pylon!

337
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,530
R-Right...

338
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,580
I did it!

339
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,070
You bastard! What the hell?!

340
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,620
The guy in the photograph didn't tell me

341
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,080
that Josuke had a friend like you!

342
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,580
I'm an alien, so I'm unaware of
this game called "Old Maid,"

343
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,610
but to suddenly trick Josuke and
tell him that he cannot leave...

344
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,970
It's like an adult beating a child at a game

345
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,250
on New Year's by tricking them.

346
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,810
This is why you should be the
one to remain in the pylon.

347
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,310
You will remain here.

348
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,060
After all the time I spent
living here, I ended up

349
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,610
with these thick calluses on my hands.

350
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,450
There's a lot of stuff in here.

351
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,410
Take this!

352
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,910
It seems you're under the impression
that that's a part of me,

353
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,780
but that is incorrect.

354
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,420
That is not me,

355
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,800
but the pylon's wire that you
were hanging off of earlier.

356
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,250
Yeah!

357
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,060
All right! Now, go to the top
and come back out, Mikitaka!

358
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,070
You're the one who finally
stepped into this pylon.

359
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,440
Do you really think I'd let you escape?

360
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm a man who has thought of nothing but
getting out of here every single day!

361
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,780
Did you forget?

362
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,640
This pylon will return whatever you do to it.

363
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,710
That wire's also a part of this pylon!

364
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,700
The angle at which the wire was cut
was made so it would return to you.

365
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,380
H-Have I been defeated?

366
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,240
M-Mikitaka! Hurry up and get out of there!

367
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,430
I can fix a wound like that!

368
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,970
Nope, he's not getting out.

369
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,890
I'm the one who's going to leave!

370
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,450
The direction and angle are perfect.

371
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,280
If you strike it, it'll strike back.

372
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,830
Mikitaka!

373
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,280
Y-You bastard!

374
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,360
I went through some trouble
getting out because of you,

375
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,050
but now I can get out easily.

376
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm sure that's gonna hurt when
you try and pry those out,

377
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,060
but you'll have plenty of time to treat it later.

378
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,130
There are some medicinal plants down there, too.

379
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,870
You bastard! Do you think you can
escape just because you're out of there?

380
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,850
I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth, damn it!

381
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,420
Of course I can escape, and rather easily.

382
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,350
You guys haven't even been able
to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

383

July 15th (Thurs)  10:42 AM

384
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,490
Who is that? I've never seen him before.

385
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,700
July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

386

July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

387
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,750
July 15th (Thurs)  10:38 AM

388
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,940
I'll find him out... no matter what.
