00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,150
Yukako Yamagishi has been depressed lately.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,130
What? There's someone you like?

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,850
Yeah! We both like each other!

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,790
I went to the Angelo Stone the other day and

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,380
there were a lot of tourists taking pictures.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,660
Wow, it's that famous now, huh?

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,990
What's wrong, Koichi?

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,470
If I can just keep Koichi in my heart,
that's all I need to be happy.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,720
I thought that once, but it's really hard...

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,780
I wish he'd look at me, even just a little.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,580
But I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do...

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,190
"My makeup will
help you encounter love"

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,770
Cinderella?

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,000
How lucky can I be?

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,620
I can't believe such a wonderful
guy proposed to me!

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,240
Thank you, Dr. Aya! Thank you so much!

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,380
Phew...

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,230
I guess a woman's youth is better spent

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,140
happy and ugly than dark and beautiful...

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,230
Come in.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,760
"My makeup will help you encounter love."

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,980
What's written on that sign is true.

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,240
If you're interested...

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,070
Welcome to Salon Cinderella.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,900
Episode 20    Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of Cinderella

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,630
Please, come in.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,180
My name is Aya Tsuji.

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,500
Phew... I'm the owner of
this place and an aesthetician.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,010
I talk like I have low blood pressure,
but don't let it bother you.

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,380
Phew...

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,130
But I'm very motivated by my work.

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,260
Phew...

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,870
You...

35
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,310
are quite beautiful.

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,350
Phew...

37
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,560
I had no idea there was
someone so beautiful in Morioh...

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,570
Now, please have a seat right over there.

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,960
Write your name and address on that form.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,820
I haven't decided that I'll do this yet.

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,330
Here's the price listing.

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,500
"Makeup to marry a celebrity"?

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,670
This salon is a bit different
from ordinary salons.

45
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,730
I'm an aesthetician who
creates faces of happiness.

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,600
Physiognomy—that is, the shape of one's face—

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,590
High Brows

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,590
Double
Eyelid

49
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,590
Big, Wide Eyes

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
can change someone's fortune.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,590
If you have a face that will be loved,

52
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,070
it'll heighten your luck
with encountering love.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
Hmm... Too bad.

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,840
The shapes of your eyes and
eyebrows aren't good.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,690
Phew...

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,310
I'm going to be blunt.

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,470
This is so stupid that
I'm beyond disappointed.

58
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,320
You're trying to charge money for this?

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,700
With that face, the more you love a boy,
the more he's going to run away.

60
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,180
Am I wrong?

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,500
Have you not experienced that?

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,900
You're wrong.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,920
I've never had that happen in my life.

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,330
Oh, no? Very well, then.

65
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,460
In your case...

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,540
I'm not very accustomed to working with CG.

68
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,930
This is the face that will encounter love.

69
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,120
Wait... This is cosmetic surgery.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,570
You do surgeries?

71
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,440
This is a face we'll create using
only makeup and beauty massage.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,980
But it only lasts thirty minutes.

73
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,570
If you don't encounter love,

74
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,980
I will return the thousand-yen fee to you.

75
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,450
Would you like to try it?

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,100
All right. If it's just makeup...

77
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,450
I have nothing to lose,
so I guess I can give it a try.

78
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,120
Thank you. Let's get started, then.

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,330
Close your eyes.

80
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,900
Make sure you don't open your eyes.

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,250
Don't move.

82
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,070
My hands may slip if you do.

83
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,890
Koichi...

84
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,280
This is the makeup that'll
help me encounter love?

85
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,850
Will my luck really change just by altering

86
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,900
the lines of my eyes and eyebrows?

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,200
Koichi?

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
I-I've been looking for you, Yukako.

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,160
Huh? Me?

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,860
Yeah... You passed by Rengatei
earlier, didn't you?

91
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,630
You looked really sad back there,

92
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,300
a-and I sort of got worried...

93
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,690
Worried?

94
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,550
You were worried about me, Koichi?

95
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,340
Y-Yeah... A lot happened between us,
but it doesn't bug me anymore,

96
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,420
so I don't want you to feel down about it.

97
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,360
R-Really?

98
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,440
Yeah...

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,370
I can't believe it...

100
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,280
Is this really because of the makeup?

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,190
K-Koichi...

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,380
Rather than standing around,

103
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,570
why don't we find a place to sit and chat?

104
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,480
Huh?

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,340
U-Um... Only if you want to...

106
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,200
Well...

107
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,450
I guess I am a little thirsty...

108
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,510
Huh? Huh?!

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,560
I really am lucky.

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,210
Things are really changing!

111
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,480
I get to be near the cute, yet strong, Koichi...

112
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,480
I suddenly want to eat a chocolate parfait.

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,340
Does that make me seem girly?

114
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,180
Huh? No! Not at all!

115
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,770
That's what I wanted, too!

116
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,950
This is like a dream...

117
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,790
Physiognomy really does exist!

118
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,330
I'm really on a roll right now.

119
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,910
My luck is really on a roll right now!

120
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
I... I can't believe it...

121
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,330
I can feel Koichi-kun's
warmth and beating heart.

122
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm so happy...

123
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,580
This is the happiest I've ever been.

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,120
Oh, It's 4 PM! I can't believe it's this late!

125
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,360
H-Huh?!

126
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,600
M-My stomach hurts!

127
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,010
Ow...

128
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,680
Y-Yukako, I'm sorry!

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,290
I'm gonna head home.

130
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,860
K-Koichi!

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,700
Why...

132
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,940
Why is it only thirty minutes?!

133
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,340
Hey, lady! Can't you see the light's red?

134
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,430
Shut up!

135
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,540
It's the light's fault for turning red!

136
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,320
Why is it only for thirty minutes?!

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,870
Make it longer!

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,840
You encountered love, didn't you?

139
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,870
You should be satisfied with that,
and come back tomorrow.

140
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,510
All of my other customers have done that.

141
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,420
No! I can't stand luck that
only allows me to be with

142
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,930
Koichi for thirty minutes,
and then rips us apart!

143
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,730
Phew...

144
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,180
Next, do the one that captures love!

145
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,110
You can do that, right?

146
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,310
You really don't listen to others, do you?

147
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,770
I said, "do it!"

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,360
Phew... Yukako.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Cinderella was able to
encounter a wonderful love,

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,110
even though she was bullied,
because she had a pure heart.

151
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,530
Which means you need to have the willingness
for such a wonderful encounter to occur.

152
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,540
Are you able to do that?

153
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,220
Willingness? What are you talking about?

154
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,530
Just changing your physiognomy
isn't enough to change your luck.

155
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,670
Phew...

156
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:33,070
I became an aesthetician because I admired
the fairy godmother in Cinderella.

157
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,930
I want to live giving happiness
to others, just like her.

158
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,530
You're very beautiful, and I like you.

159
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,220
So I'll do this specially for you.

160
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,810
However...

161
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,530
We're going to have to work on various parts.

162
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,310
Phew...

163
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,180
It's your whole body... The whole body

164
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,080
must be transformed into
a body to capture love.

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,920
And the willingness you need to do that is this.

166
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,820
You need to apply this
lipstick every thirty minutes,

167
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,510
except when you're asleep.

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,550
It's to maintain your body
after I've worked on it.

169
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,060
If you can do this, you'll have the
luck to capture love for eternity.

170
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,630
The price is 72,000 yen for 24 hours.

171
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,690
Fine. Do it.

172
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,480
Good... Now, don't move.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,700
Make sure you don't open your eyes.

174
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,290
I knew you weren't a normal aesthetician.

175
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,150
Th-This power...

176
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,630
You can see my Cinderella?

177
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,440
I see... so they were Stand powers.

178
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,130
But the more I think about it, I don't care.

179
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,480
If you wanted to harm me,
you would have already tried.

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,570
I trust you. You're my fairy godmother.

181
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,520
You startled me...

182
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,270
Just start already.

183
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,180
What a wonderful girl...

184
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,730
All right. I'll work my magic.

185
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,790
Cinderella is a Stand that
transforms the body's image.

186
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,790
This perfectly completes the work
on your body to capture love.

187
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,960
Yukako, your body has become
invincible when it comes to love.

188
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,600
The pain in my stomach suddenly went away...

189
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,750
Oh, this is Yukako's bag! Whoops!

190
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,890
I have to go back and return it to her!

191
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,860
Koichi.

192
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,480
Y-Yukako...

193
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,540
O-Oh, yeah. Here! This is your bag.

194
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Huh?

195
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,370
And this is mine.

196
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,710
I accidentally took it. Sorry about that!

197
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,750
W-Well, I'll see you later.

198
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,510
W-Wait, Koichi!

199
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,010
Look at me.

200
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,100
Don't you feel something
when you look at me?

201
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,550
W-Well... Well...

202
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,920
Well...

203
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,410
Hey! If it isn't Koichi!

204
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,900
Rohan-sensei!

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm heading to the Kame Yu
department store for research.

206
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,910
Come with me.

207
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,880
I was planning on heading home...

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,320
It's embarrassing taking pictures in a
department store by myself, you know.

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,950
So please?

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,460
What is this?

211
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,930
You're so needy... Jeez.

212
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,170
Wasn't I supposed to become
the invincible heroine?!

213
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,500
What happened to the effectiveness

214
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,300
of your Cinderella's powers?!

215
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,470
Oh, Ko.

216
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,970
No, Koichi's heart definitely
belongs to you now.

217
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,970
Oh, Mom. Sis.

218
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,900
But his reasoning is denying you.

219
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,190
Did something happen between
you and Koichi in the past?

220
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,350
That must be it.

221
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,240
Oh, this gentleman is a manga artist?

222
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,110
He's lovely. May we join you?

223
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,110
But don't worry.

224
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,950
Luck will eventually take your side.

225
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,180
Cinderella is absolute.

226
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,880
By the way, it's 4:45.
It's almost been thirty minutes.

227
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,490
Make sure you don't forget
to apply the lipstick.

228
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,250
Yes, I'm doing it now.

229
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,000
Luck will take my side, huh?

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
What? You're going to Kame Yu? So are we.

231
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
Huh?!

232
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,670
What's with these people?!

233
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,630
There are even more of them!

234
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,300
And now the person I want here
the least, his mother, is here!

235
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,390
Luck is on my side, my ass!

236
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,890
I'll kill that salon bitch!

237
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,610
I guess I'll start taking pictures here.

238
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,330
H-Hey, are you using the flash?

239
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,900
This isn't good, Josuke.

240
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,490
She's been startled, and the
stress is making her disappear!

241
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,660
H-Hey, Old Man! Head outside!

242
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
P-Pardon me!

243
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,730
Move out of the way, please!

244
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,130
Huh?

245
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,040
What's going on?

246
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,790
Ah!

247
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,170
Whoa! Sorry, Koichi!

248
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,050
Y-Yukako..

249
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,060
K-Koichi...

250
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,530
This... is luck.

251
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,950
This is it!

252
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,040
Our hearts are understanding each other.

253
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,630
Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...

254
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,610
This is my all...

255
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,760
And my life is going to
change starting now...

256
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:57,460
Ci

257
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,630
Cin

258
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:57,830
Cinde

259
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,000
Cindere

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
Cinderella

261
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:58,880
Aya

262
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,960
Aya Tsuji

263
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,460
Josuke, Okuyasu...

264
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,300
I... ended up kissing Yukako. Yeah.

265
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,180
Flail

266
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,610
What did she do to you?!

267
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,750
That bitch must have tried
to pull something again!

268
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,170
Calm down! It's not like that...

269
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,980
I just...

270
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,720
It seems I've fallen in love with Yukako.

271
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,570
Huh?

272
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,550
I'm starting to think that her
personality isn't so bad...

273
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,700
It makes me feel warm inside.

274
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,580
Is this love?

275
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,870
I'm not really sure...

276
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,870
Hey, Okuyasu, did you hear him?

277
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,730
Even a Stand would be blown
to the moon if it heard that.

278
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,190
He and Yukako...

279
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
Gush

280
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,720
Hey, hey, hey!
You don't have to cry about it!

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,340
But, Koichi...

282
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,770
I don't know what led to this sudden 180,

283
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,830
but if you and Yukako both
have feelings for each other,

284
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,070
then there shouldn't be a problem.

285
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,400
That's not it, though...

286
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,320
Yukako has refused to see me ever since.

287
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,850
That's the mystery.

288
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,170
She hasn't come to school for two days.

289
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,570
She won't answer the phone...

290
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,790
She hasn't contacted me
at all. Nothing. That's it.

291
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,930
Y-You mean ever since you guys kissed...

292
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,350
You haven't heard anything?

293
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,320
Not at all.

294
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,170
Hmm... That is very bizarre.

295
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:30,050
If anything, I admired Yukako
for her dedication to love.

296
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,390
But honestly, I don't think you're going to

297
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,310
get an answer unless you ask Yukako in person.

298
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,560
We really shouldn't get involved...

299
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,690
Y-Yeah...

300
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,080
But if you're in danger, let us know!

301
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,690
We'll be right there!

302
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,250
Thanks. I'm gonna go now.

303
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,130
Yeah.

304
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,060
But...

305
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,800
Damn Koichi! I can't believe he kissed a girl!

306
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Seriously, it's no reason to cry.

307
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,380
Th-That hair!

308
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,710
Yukako!

309
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,010
W-Wait, Yukako!

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,510
U-Um...

311
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,020
You've got the wrong person.

312
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,480
U-Um... You looked just
like her from behind, so...

313
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,280
Actually, no, wait!

314
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,870
K-Koichi...

315
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,350
How dare you do this to me,
you stupid dumbass?!

316
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,190
My face just keeps falling apart!

317
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,230
Even if I put on makeup, it just falls off!

318
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,770
You asshole woman!

319
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,690
Turn my face back to normal!

320
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,110
It appears

321
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,100
that you broke your promise.

322
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,730
That's too bad.

323
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,380
I persistently told you to reapply the
Cinderella lipstick every thirty minutes...

324
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650
I just forgot, that's all!

325
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,590
Wh-What is this? My hands...

326
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,600
They're turning into mush!

327
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,370
Your palm lines and
fingerprints are disappearing.

328
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,040
You shouldn't have broken the promise.

329
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,940
That lipstick was to guarantee your luck.

330
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,580
You need a lot of energy
to change someone's luck.

331
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,570
And now that has gone away.

332
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,280
It's your own fault for
underestimating your luck.

333
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,320
D-Do you want to die?!

334
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,790
Die?

335
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm not running a salon for the
sake of ambition and money alone.

336
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,520
I wanted to be like the fairy godmother

337
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,190
in Cinderella who brings people happiness.

338
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,410
It is truly a shame.

339
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,340
I shouldn't have tried to
make your wish come true.

340
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,980
Your face and your palm lines are now gone.

341
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,990
They've been eliminated from this world.

342
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,350
What... did you say?

343
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,810
They've disappeared.

344
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,480
There's no use for someone
who's missing parts.

345
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,890
My face... is gone?

346
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,110
What kind of life does someone
with missing parts live?

347
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,460
Yukako!

348
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,200
K-Koichi!

349
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,960
Why is he...

350
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,230
No, I can't... He'll find me out.

351
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,560
N-No, you've got the wrong person.

352
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,920
Dr. Aya, men aren't
allowed in here, are they?

353
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,460
Hurry and throw him out, please.

354
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,740
It's that personality...

355
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,470
That insanely tough personality.

356
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,140
No doubt about it. You're Yukako.

357
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,190
I sort of fell for that personality...

358
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,460
And that lady is a Stand user, right?

359
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,690
And she did something to you...

360
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,400
It's all over.

361
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,140
I can't go on living.

362
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,410
I'll kill you, Aya Tsuji!

363
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,160
I'll kill you!

364
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,040
Calm down.

365
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,020
That's... P-Part of her face went flying!

366
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,970
There we go.

367
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,970
Phew...

368
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,680
So this is Koichi... Phew...

369
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,710
He was able to figure out that you were

370
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,120
Yukako Yamagishi, even though
your face is different.

371
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,310
Even though you've denied yourself,

372
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,980
some people can see others' personalities.

373
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,890
All right, Yukako.

374
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,840
On his behalf, I'll give you one
last chance as a fairy godmother.

375
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,830
Your last chance is to choose one of these.

376
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,830
Your real face is now gone,

377
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,460
but my Cinderella has memorized
every face we have ever worked on.

378
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,210
Choose your own face out of these.

379
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,470
If you can pick your own face,

380
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,010
it's possible to return your face to normal.

381
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,660
Your palm lines and fingerprints
will return naturally, too.

382
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,100
Just like Cinderella's glass slippers,
pick the one that's the perfect fit for you.

383
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,560
You should've let me do that
to begin with, you dumbass!

384
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,430
I can figure that out easily!

385
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,490
I look at my face in the mirror every day!

386
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,220
But if you choose someone else's face,

387
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,070
that face will never suit you.

388
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,000
In fact, speaking in terms of
my own beauty standards,

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,750
I will warn you that your
face will become hideous.

390
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,210
And your luck will be forever based on that face.

391
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,220
Y-Yukako...

392
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,940
Choose carefully.

393
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,720
Remember, your face in the mirror is reversed.

394
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,870
R-Right...

395
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,720
The correct answer is that they're all wrong.

396
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,890
None of the faces there are yours.

397
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,110
If you can figure that out,
I'll fix your face.

398
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,700
That is my rule as Fairy Godmother.

399
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,120
Once I start second-guessing, others
look like they might be mine, too...

400
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,870
But...

401
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,700
This is it! There's no doubt about it!

402
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,000
I know, because it's my own face!

403
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,790
Are you sure?

404
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,120
You'll find out once you try to put it on.

405
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,660
N-No... This isn't it.

406
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,940
My eyes look a bit more slanted.

407
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,020
Wh-Which is it?

408
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,600
I-I really can't tell after all...

409
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,160
What's the matter? Hurry up and choose.

410
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,330
No, I'm not going to choose.

411
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,080
What?

412
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,790
What are you saying?

413
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,960
You want to live your life without a face?

414
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm going to have Koichi choose for me.

415
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,450
Because... No matter what face
it is or what luck it carries,

416
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,470
so long as it was chosen by
Koichi, that's all I'll need.

417
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,610
I can live with that.

418
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,600
I won't have any regrets.

419
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,070
B-But that's not...

420
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,610
I don't care.

421
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,210
Please choose, Koichi.

422
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,620
O-Okay...

423
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,840
This is it.

424
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,470
I don't know why, but I have
a feeling it's this one.

425
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,560
But if it's not the right face...

426
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,970
That's Reverb, my Stand.

427
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:17,600
U-Um, use your Stand to hurt
Reverb's eyes, and make me blind.

428
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,110
You said you wouldn't have any regrets,

429
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,990
but knowing your personality,

430
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,020
I'm sure you won't want me to look
at your face if it's not your own.

431
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,560
Because I've fallen in love with you,

432
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,660
I would really hate for that to happen.

433
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,550
So I think the best solution is
for me to not be able to see.

434
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,290
Koichi...

435
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,800
All right, Yukako...

436
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,710
Yes.

437
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,240
L-Look, Koichi!

438
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
It fits perfectly!

439
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,730
Koichi!

440
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,680
We did it, Yukako!

441
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,110
It's because you chose my face for me, Koichi!

442
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,920
Who would have thought he'd say

443
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,680
he'd go blind so he couldn't see her face?

444
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,290
I bent my rules as Fairy Godmother a bit,
but I fixed your face for you.

445
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,520
If I took the eyesight of a boy
who has nothing to do with this,

446
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,370
my reputation as Fairy
Godmother would be tarnished.

447
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,130
Yukako, it seems that you do, at least,
know a good man when you see one.

448
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,770
Salon Cinderella is currently open.

449
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,300
Her makeup will help you encounter love.
