2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,830
So that guy, Hazamada, says

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,360
he doesn't know anything
about the electric bastard

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,880
that killed my big bro?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,580
Yeah. He said he's only ever
talked to him on the phone.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,300
And you believed him, Josuke?
Did you torture him?

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,390
If Hazamada actually knew who that guy was,

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,470
he would probably have
already come to silence him.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,250
R-Right... Just like my big bro.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,470
Yeah. Seeing as how Hazamada is alive,
that proves he really doesn't know.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,230
But Hazamada did say this...

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,480
Stand users, for some reason, seem to
be unknowingly drawn to one another,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,080
even if they don't know each other.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,480
They say that you're bound to
the person that you're going

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,610
to marry by the red string of fate, right?

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,890
It's sort of like that.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,240
You just end up eventually meeting them.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,440
They might be an enemy, a friend,
the guy who steps on your foot on the bus,

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,380
or someone who just moved in next door.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,480
You just don't know.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,590
Morioh's not very big...

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,210
I don't know how many Stand
users are in this town right now,

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,220
but no matter how they try to hide,
they'll eventually show themselves.

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,800
He knows that's going to happen eventually.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,110
He wants you to disappear.

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,810
Damn it.

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,640
What a coward.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,880
He needs to attack us already!

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,260
But that also means that he's cautious.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,700
When guys like that attack,

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,720
it's probably only when they're
certain they're going to win.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,850
Oh?

33
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, that's Koichi.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,380
Why's he trying to act all cool, drinking tea?

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,130
Hey, Ko—

36
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,220
What?!

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,970
A... A girl?!

38
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,900
Diamond is Unbreakable

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,900
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,750
Episode 8  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 1

41
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,180
Koichi, was me asking
you to come here, um...

42
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,470
a bother?

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,640
Huh? No, it's not a bother...

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,230
But I was wondering what you needed.

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,340
Wow, so Koichi's with a girl...

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,930
That chick's in my class!
Her name is Yukako Yamagishi.

47
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,110
All right! Let's get a bit closer!

48
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,520
If you wanted to see my
notes on some homework,

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,500
my grades aren't that good,
and my handwriting's messy.

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,410
If it's money, I can probably
manage about 1,000 yen...

51
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,870
Or did you want me to switch
weekly duties with you?

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,830
That's not what this is about.

53
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,050
Huh? It's not? Then what is it?

54
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,760
If you need someone to take
in a kitten or a puppy,

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,430
we've already got a dumb
dog named Police at home.

56
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,800
Koichi!

57
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,010
I'm just going to come out and say it.

58
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,890
Koichi...

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,770
I'm in love with you, Koichi.

60
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,440
Huh?

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
What?!

62
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,750
U-Um... Uh, um... Wh-What?!

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,120
You're the only thing I think
about all day, Koichi.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,050
I've been so afraid to
express these feelings...

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,500
But if I don't, I feel like
my chest is going to burst.

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,430
I don't mind if you hate me.

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,210
I just thought I'd be brave and tell you.

68
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,350
Wh-What is going on? Did someone
just confess her love to me?!

69
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,510
To me?!

70
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,390
I can't believe it, but she
did just say that, right?

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,140
I-I'm so happy...

72
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,420
Why is it Koichi? You can't
be serious! Come on!

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,170
Even I've never had anyone tell me that!

74
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,700
You don't have to cry about it.

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,580
But seriously? I'm surprised, Koichi...

76
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,290
I'm sure that you must have
a girlfriend, Koichi...

77
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,540
Huh? I-I don't...

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,000
But, um... Are you making fun of me?

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,630
I'm serious!

80
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,940
Koichi, your face has gotten sharper lately.

81
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,640
You look like a man with
courage and conviction.

82
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,770
But you're also so cute when you smile.

83
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, she's definitely got a point.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,190
My face is pretty sharp too, isn't it?

85
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,030
I think the best thing
about a man is his future.

86
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,470
And Koichi, your future is shining.

87
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,710
Wh-When you speak that highly of me...

88
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm sure you must hate girls
like me that aren't cute.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,210
Huh? Not cute? That's not true...

90
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,700
Damn it, she is cute!

91
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,480
Just say yes already!

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,090
That bastard has all the luck!

93
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,340
Do you hate me?

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,970
Huh? Uh, n-no, I don't, but...

95
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,810
Then do you love me?

96
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,060
Huh? Wait a sec... It's just that, um...

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,020
So you do hate me...

98
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,650
Huh? That's not it!

99
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,400
It's just, when you ask me that so suddenly—

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,550
Which is it?! Do you love me or don't you?!

101
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,560
Just answer me already!
I've already told you so much!

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,660
I spilled my coffee! This is all your fault!

103
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,420
Um... I just got all worked up...
I-I'm sorry. I'm just...

104
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,030
By the way, you will come
see me again, right?

105
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,780
Y-You know... I feel like a
balloon that's been deflated.

106
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,540
All my jealousy just flew away somewhere.

107
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,710
Y-Yeah...

108
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,030
Let's just pretend we never saw anything.

109
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,320
Yeah.

110
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,870
What's wrong with this cola?!

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,460
Th-Th-There's so much... hair in it!

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,960
Stand users are drawn to one another...

113
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,040
Nah, it couldn't be.

114
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,000
Chemistry Lab

115
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,550
It's me, Koichi.

116
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,020
Y-Yukako!

117
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
What are you doing?

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Um, as you can see,
it's my turn to clean the lab.

119
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,100
Fourth period was chemistry lab.

120
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,410
Ah...

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,540
Koichi...

122
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,410
I said some weird things yesterday.

123
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,540
Would you just forget all that?

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,260
I get that way when I think too hard.
It's so embarrassing.

125
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,550
People are supposed to be more broad-minded.

126
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,800
Uh, r-right...

127
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,770
It was a little surprising,
b-but I didn't think anything of it...

128
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,520
Will you still be friends with me?

129
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
O-Of course! I would be honored, yes!

130
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,890
Thank goodness.

131
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,260
I was so worried about
what I'd do if you hated me,

132
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,080
I couldn't sleep all night.

133
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,750
That's a bit dramatic.

134
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,830
And to make it up to you... Here.

135
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,990
I was up until this morning
knitting this for you, Koichi.

136
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,790
Thank goodness! It's a perfect fit!

137
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,460
I knew your height and chest size, but
I was worried how it would fit your shoulders.

138
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,580
Charm

139
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,160
I made you a good luck charm, too...

140
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,510
In hopes that you'll find a wonderful love.

141
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,930
I also prepared lunch so we
could eat it together...

142
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,610
I bought this shrimp at the
fish market this morning.

143
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,570
You can't find this freshness at a store.

144
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,420
See this flounder meuniere?

145
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,570
I personally took out all of the
bones, one by one, with tweezers.

146
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,690
Here. Say, "Ah."

147
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,700
Ahh...

148
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,740
There's one thing I know now...

149
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,040
Yukako Yamagishi, to be completely
honest, is extremely strange!

150
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,330
Ahh...

151
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,170
I have to hurry up and turn her down!

152
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,600
B-But if I eat this, it'll be like saying yes...

153
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,630
Ahh!

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,500
But if I refuse it, she'll probably get mad.

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,970
What should I do?!

156
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,950
Hirose!

157
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,800
Why are you wasting time?

158
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,480
You need to hurry up and throw this
garbage away before class starts.

159
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,780
I-I'm saved!

160
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,980
R-Right! Right!

161
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
I-I'd better go throw it away.

162
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,820
Ugh, you're useless.

163
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,370
Here, give me that.

164
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,700
I'll hold half of it for you.

165
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,380
Huh? N-No, I'd feel bad...

166
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,410
Just give it to me!

167
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,410
I'm the class rep, so I'm
the one who'll get yelled at.

168
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,090
Jeez!

169
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,260
S-Sorry...

170
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,950
Hey, you.

171
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,720
Would you stop bothering Koichi?

172
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,500
Koichi? You mean Koichi Hirose?

173
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,360
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

174
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,980
I know what you're doing.

175
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,240
The stench of a homewrecker is all over you.

176
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,860
Homewrecker?! What are you talking about?

177
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,870
Listen well. If you ever
come close to Koichi again,

178
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,300
I'll make sure you regret it.

179
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,330
Just one second.

180
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,210
I tried to be classy about this, but...

181
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,710
Koichi Hirose?

182
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,590
I couldn't care less about him!

183
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,220
You have no right to tell me what
the hell I can or can't do!

184
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,340
Dumbass!

185
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,840
Ow!

186
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,790
What was that?

187
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,780
What the hell is her problem?!

188
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,900
She's not right in the head.
She actually likes Hirose?

189
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,570
Hmph. Hilarious. I'll tell the whole school!

190
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,950
Huh?

191
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,450
What is that?

192
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,750
Something's hot... Something's wrong.

193
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,480
Something's not right...

194
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,460
It's insanely hot...

195
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,470
W-Water!

196
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,970
S-Someone! I need w-wa...

197
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,690
Hey, Josuke...

198
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,860
Looks like Yukako Yamagishi
really was a Stand user.

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,450
Her Stand has hair that moves.

200
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,460
Yeah. But it doesn't seem like she's
an enemy, or going to attack Koichi.

201
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,420
By the way, Okuyasu, what are
you gonna do about her hair?

202
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,470
I can't fix something after
your The Hand takes it away.

203
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,320
She can't complain. I saved her
from getting burnt to a crisp.

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,350
Sorry, but I'm not a beautician.

Year 1    English Exam    Answer Sheet

215
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,540
Quiz 2     Koichi Hirose

216
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,540
This is my English test from earlier.

217
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm worrying so much about Yukako,
I can't concentrate on anything else.

218
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,800
Even I did better! I only got 32 points, though.

219
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,380
To be honest, I was a little happy at first.

220
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,160
I'd never had a girl tell me she loved me before.

221
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,390
I get that. I totally get that!
So much it hurts!

222
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,500
But I'm the one who let it come to this
by not being up-front with her.

223
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm thinking about telling her straight

224
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,170
that I don't like her or anything,
so she needs to leave me alone.

225
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,240
That's not a good idea, Koichi.

226
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,610
If you say that, you're only going to add
fuel to the flames of Yukako's passion.

227
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,240
You'll piss her off.

228
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,120
Y-You think so?

229
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
Of course! Listen.

230
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Convincing Yukako Yamagishi not to use
her Stand of hair for evil will have to wait.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Right now, we have to figure out
how to make her not hate you.

232
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,390
But how?

233
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,870
No matter how strongly she feels about you,

234
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,710
if she gets an idea in her head that you're
a disenchanting, horrible, boring guy,

235
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,240
everything will be happily ever after, right?

236
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,470
Y-Yeah...

237
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,600
So you've just got to act that
way on purpose in front of her.

238
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,370
Yeah, that totally makes sense!

239
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,900
You're so smart, Josuke.

240
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,320
Thanks!

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,950
But hearing that from you doesn't
make me feel better.

242
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,290
I wonder what I need to do to
make Yukako think I'm terrible.

243
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,920
Well, most girls aren't into
bad hygiene or mama's boys.

244
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,190
I-I don't want her to think I'm a mama's boy!

245
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,470
She might get mad at my
mom and put her in danger!

246
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,690
Then it's bad hygiene for you!

247
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,480
Starting today, no more baths.

248
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,120
Huh?!

249
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,740
Yeah, and don't brush your teeth
or change your underwear.

250
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,860
How about getting some lice
or spiders in your hair?

251
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,980
Having smelly socks is pretty bad.

252
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,800
Maybe you should fart everywhere.

253
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,530
Yeah, she'll totally hate that!

254
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,940
Stop messing around! I'm serious about this!

255
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,050
I'm being serious, too!

256
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,040
You need a snotty nose and some drool, too.

257
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,790
What?!

258
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,040
If you don't want to do that,
then you need to become a guy

259
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,930
who seems like he doesn't have a future.

260
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,430
You need to make her give up on you.

261
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,690
We'll help you out. All right?

262
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,180
Okay...

263
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,860
What? Koichi Hirose did that? Unbelievable!

264
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,310
He was really shoplifting? That's awful.

265
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,870
Yeah! Koichi said so himself.

266
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,650
He was talking about it like he was proud of it.

267
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,690
You know what else?
Koichi never keeps his promises.

268
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,500
I lent him money, and he never paid me back.

269
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,490
He cheats on his tests
and steals girls' underwear.

270
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,000
He's got no future. He's gonna
bring about his own downfall.

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,770
I'm gonna stop hanging out with him.

272
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,510
I'll cut ties with him, too.

273
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,030
Man, that girl is intense.

274
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,980
Now as long as Koichi confirms he
did all of this stuff by tomorrow,

275
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,780
she'll give up.

276
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,990
Josuke, Okuyasu...

277
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,250
I hope they did a good job with all that stuff.

278
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,520
I hope she actually gives up on me.

279
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,260
What is that?

280
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,940
My eyes are closed... Is this a dream?

281
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,530
A woman?

282
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,530
I-It's Yukako!

283
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,890
I can't believe this. She's even
showing up in my dreams...

284
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,300
I can't rest at all!

285
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,910
It appears that your friends don't
think too highly of you, Koichi.

286
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,430
But don't worry. You have me.

287
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,810
I'll properly discipline you and
make you into a fine man.

288
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,970
You have something that other men don't.

289
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,280
You must live up to that potential.

290
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,540
J-Josuke! This totally backfired!

291
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,730
Where am I?

292
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,210
Koichi, are you hungry?

293
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,230
Breakfast will be ready shortly.

294
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,240
O-Okay...

295
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,990
She has that hair Stand...

296
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm going to have to wait for a chance to run.

297
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,900
That's my only hope!

298
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,750
Th-There's something I want to ask you.

299
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,740
Yes?

300
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,750
Your hair last night... Wh-What was that?

301
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,880
Did that startle you?

302
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,800
Of course. I guess anyone who
suddenly saw that would be.

303
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,260
Around February of this year,

304
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,810
someone shot an arrow through my chest.

305
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,980
No, that might have been a dream.

306
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,430
When I woke up, my wound was healed,
and I was able to do that...

307
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,820
Keicho Nijimura!

308
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,290
D-Do you know anyone else who
can do anything like that?

309
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,470
No.

310
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,080
She hasn't realized that I'm a Stand user!

311
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,750
Now, have a seat. You're a growing boy.

312
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,580
If you don't get proper nourishment,

313
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,090
you can't become a fine man for me.

314
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,300
I-I just need to play along with her for now.

315
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,010
Wow, this looks delicious! I'm digging in!

316
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,340
You're not eating just yet, Koichi.

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,980
Even if a man is more than just
his brains, this is just awful.

321
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,150
I've decided to have you study while you eat.

322
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,140
Understand?

323
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,470
I'm going to give you some questions.

324
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,420
You'll choose the correct
answer from boxes A, B, and C,

325
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,760
and you'll eat what's inside your chosen box.

326
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,870
W-Wait a sec...

327
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,280
You're going to do this!

328
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,380
While you live in this house, everything
we do must be for your betterment!

329
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,490
Right?

330
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,850
Here's your question.

331
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,380
Prince often sings the lyric "funky music."
What does that mean in Japanese?

332
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,700
Wild Music

333
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,730
A: Wild music.

334
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,950
B: Primitive music.

335
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,590
Primitive Music

336
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,520
C: Fantasy music.

337
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,510
Fantasy Music

338
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,630
I-If I disobey, I'll be in trouble...

339
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,190
B-But I have no idea what the answer is.

340
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,200
I have a feeling it's A,
but B and C also sound right.

341
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,200
Whatever, I'll just pick one.

342
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,980
I think it's B...

343
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,210
Squee! You're right!

344
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm so happy! This box contains boiled eggs!

345
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,940
I'll peel them for you.
You want some salt, right?

346
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,310
By the way, if you had chosen box A,
I would have had you eat this eraser.

347
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,930
Wild Music

348
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,220
Huh?!

349
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,390
Box C contained soap.

350
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,820
Wh-What?!

351
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,480
Next, you'll be able to eat
bacon and eggs. Do your best.

352
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,180
Question:  How is "contrast" (taisho)
written in Japanese?

353
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,870
Is it taisho A, taisho B, or taisho C?

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,260
Taisho

355
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,890
Taisho

356
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,860
Taisho

357
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,430
Sh-She's serious...

358
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,870
If I choose the wrong box, she'll definitely
make me eat what's in there...

359
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,090
Come on, hurry up and answer!

360
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,750
The food will get cold.

361
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,510
U-Um, uh...

362
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,010
What am I going to do? This is ridiculous...

363
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,890
I-I think it's C...

364
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,520
Koichi, you just chose your answer by
watching the look on my face, didn't you?

365
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,400
Huh?!

366
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,280
So the rumors about you being someone

367
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,380
who's sneaky and shoplifts and
cheats on his tests is true!

368
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,390
As punishment, I'll have
you eat both A and B.

369
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,710
A is English vocabulary corn flakes.

370
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,480
B is asparagus wrapped in pages
from an English dictionary.

371
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,580
I'm going to make sure
you learn while you eat!

372
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,550
Here!

373
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,180
Open your mouth! I'll feed it to you.

374
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,820
What's the matter? Eat!

375
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,690
No way! You expect me to put up
with this?! I can't take it anymore!

376
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm outta here!

377
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,410
I-I'm being pulled! By my scalp!

378
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,320
Th-There's moving hair mixed in!

379
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,610
That's right. I had planted a few hundred
strands of my hair in your scalp.

380
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,400
Koichi,

381
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,030
you may come to hate me.

382
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,720
But once you leave this house,

383
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,580
you'll see a much better man in the mirror,

384
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,970
and I know you'll thank me.

385
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,170
You'll realize that you need
a woman like me in your life.

386
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,480
You won't be able to live
without Yukako Yamagishi.

387
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,650
And just so you know, until you
finish eating plates A and B,

388
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,860
you won't be getting the next dish.

389
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,490
This is some company president's holiday villa.

390
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,720
No one will come here until summer.

391
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
S-Summer?!

392
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,000
Even then,

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,630
it doesn't matter if anyone comes...

394
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,610
Because love is invincible.

395
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,820
H-Help me!

396
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,370
