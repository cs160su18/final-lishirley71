00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,980
This arrow is very precious.
It's the only one there is.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,790
It's my precious objective.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,490
I just have to retrieve it.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,950
Don't you dare pull out that arrow!
It'll make him bleed even more!

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,340
Because my little brother's an idiot,
I have to kill you now.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,650
Which means it won't be good
if something happens to this arrow.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,640
If the lady next door happens to see it,
or if it snaps in half, that'd be bad news.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,660
I'm a very methodical type, you see,

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,890
so I want to make sure I put
the arrow away properly.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,320
When you're listening to CDs, you properly
put the first one away in its case

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,400
before listening to the second one, right?

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,560
Everyone's like that.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,530
I'm like that, too.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Oh? You're gonna come into this house?

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,260
Think before you speak!

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,370
If I don't come in, I can't kick
your ass and treat Koichi's wounds!

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,720
Bro! I haven't lost yet!

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,010
Hold off on attacking him!

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,800
Attack?

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,970
We ain't finished yet!

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,180
Something's coming from...

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,060
the darkness of the ceiling!

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,460
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 4  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2

27
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,690
Okuyasu...

28
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,610
How stupid you are never ceases to amaze me.

29
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,380
If you hadn't come staggering in here,

30
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,530
my Worse Company would have
attacked Josuke for sure.

31
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,500
And you actually walked into
its attack trajectory.

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,290
Bro...

33
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,880
Your Stand, The Hand, is terrifying,
but you're completely incompetent.

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,240
I told you over and over,
ever since we were kids,

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,180
that incompetent people drag down
everyone around them, didn't I?

36
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,180
I told you over and over that people
only have the right to live

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,450
if they keep growing, didn't I?

38
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,720
What's with his injuries?

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,060
What kind of attack makes you
end up with wounds like that?

40
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,120
Anyway, it seems that something's up there.

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,290
Little brother,

42
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,290
I think it's only natural that
morons like you should die!

43
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,290
It left a ton of holes again!

44
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,720
What kind of attack is that?

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,320
Shining Diamond!

46
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,890
Are you trying to attack your brother, too?!

47
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,810
Josuke Higashikata...

48
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,730
I'm sure he won't abandon
this brat he called Koichi.

49
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,480
He'll most likely come in here again.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,620
I'll kill him, no matter what...

51
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,530
I'll kill anyone who gets in the way
of this bow and arrow's objective,

52
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,210
no matter who they may be!

53
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,340
Now, then... How about you tell me
about your brother's Stand?

54
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,570
Tell me what his Stand really is!

55
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,020
If you tell me, I'll treat your wounds.

56
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,150
Like hell... I'm gonna tell you...

57
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,040
Dumbass...

58
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,060
As I thought.

59
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,700
Well, then... I guess I have no choice!

60
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,340
I'm gonna go in there again,
so just don't get in my way, Okuyasu.

61
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,810
Koichi doesn't have much time!

62
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,020
His Stand attacks from somewhere
within this darkness.

63
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,080
Going in here is pretty dangerous.

64
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,780
I've got no choice but to
use all of my senses fully...

65
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,130
Hey, wait a minute!

66
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,030
Huh?

67
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,810
Why, Josuke? Why did you treat my wounds?

68
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,660
Shut up. I'll tell you later.

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,610
I might attack you! I'm your enemy!

70
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,790
You want a piece of me?

71
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,050
After I hear your answer!
Why did you treat my wounds?

72
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm not very smart,
so you're gonna have to tell me!

73
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,490
And that wound on your hand!

74
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,680
You got that when you were
pulling me outside, didn't you?

75
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,690
I wanna know why you went
through all that to save me.

76
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,620
There's no deep reason.

77
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,910
"There's no reason he has to die."

78
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,600
That's what I thought back there.

79
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,340
Koichi...

80
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,370
The trail leads upstairs.

81
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,120
I still have more questions, Josuke!

82
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,940
What's your problem?!

83
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm begging you, just let me save Koichi!

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Why?!

85
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,190
Why don't you use your Stand's
powers to fix your own hand?

86
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,090
You should just fix it up
like you did with my face.

87
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,590
My Shining Diamond can't
repair my own wounds.

88
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,350
It just means life isn't that easy.

89
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,470
And, more than anything,

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,610
I have no way of saving people
who've already died.

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,730
Let me just say one thing, Okuyasu.

92
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,950
If Koichi dies, I don't know what
I'm gonna do to your brother.

93
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,360
So don't hold it against me. It was your
brother who caused all this trouble.

94
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,030
You got that? If you do, stay outside.

95
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,640
Koichi!

96
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,320
Damn it... This is definitely a trap.

97
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,800
He plans to attack me from somewhere
as soon as I get close to Koichi.

98
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,060
But...

99
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,100
Even if I know it's a trap,
I have no choice but to go!

100
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,700
Koichi doesn't even have seconds left!

101
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,620
What?!

102
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,490
Okuyasu, you bastard!

103
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,790
Josuke!

104
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
Gyaon

105
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,580
Koichi just...

106
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,610
Because I'm stupid, I just
act on what's in my heart.

107
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,210
Just once, just this once,
I'll repay my debt to you.

108
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,840
I won't do anything else.

109
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,910
I won't help out my Bro,
or do anything to you, either.

110
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,790
This is it.

111
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,110
That's just great, Okuyasu.

112
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,950
Hey, you were in great danger, Koichi.

113
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,950
I'm glad you came to.

114
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,600
How many fingers am I holding up?

115
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,250
Five...

116
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,070
I-I got my head trapped between the gates,

117
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,960
and then, uh... um...

118
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,260
Wh-Where are we?

119
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,720
That dangerous situation we were
in earlier isn't over yet, Koichi.

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,520
I want to go down those
stairs and go outside,

121
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,460
but I wonder if Okuyasu's brother
will let us do that safely...

122
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,850
There's definitely something up there.

123
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,280
Something's lurking in the
shadows of the ceiling.

124
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,210
What's that?

125
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,590
Something really fast just went by.

126
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,730
Josuke, what's going on?

127
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,220
Koichi, I'm sure you have no
idea what's going on right now.

128
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,180
For now, don't ask any questions,
and get closer to me.

129
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,650
Earlier, it was creepy
because I couldn't see it,

130
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,250
but I feel a bit more at ease
now that I've seen it.

131
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,060
It just looks like a shrimp
with very little power.

132
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,980
This battle's gonna end with
me sending Shining Diamond

133
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,750
after that shrimp the next time it pops up.

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,490
There you are!

135
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,580
What the heck? There's a ton of them!

136
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,200
And that uniform...

137
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,740
Burn

138
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,420
Wh-What's...

139
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,130
A bunch of guys that look like
toy soldiers are falling...

140
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,090
Are these Okuyasu's brother's Stand?

141
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,890
Ow!

142
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,810
You bastard!

143
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,940
I guess attacking two or three
won't do enough damage.

144
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,530
And the wounds are small, but their
destructive power is the real thing.

145
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,670
We're sure to get seriously
hurt if we fight these things.

146
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,190
Since Okuyasu decided to meddle
and save that brat,

147
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,170
my plan's been derailed.

148
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,690
But they won't be leaving this house...

149
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,530
Nor will they leave my Stand,
Worse Company's, battlefield.

150
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,430
Wo

151
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,550
Wor

152
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,720
Worse

153
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:43,840
Worse Co

154
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:43,930
Worse Com

155
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,050
Worse Compa

156
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,060
Worse Company

157
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:44,760
Kei

158
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:44,890
Keicho

159
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,010
Keicho Niji

160
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,060
Keicho Nijimura

161
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,560
Worse Company?

162
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,430
Josuke, wh-what's...

163
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,480
Don't ask questions.

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm sure you don't get it,
but just shut up and stay back!

165
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,290
We're in real trouble right now!

166
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,550
All units, halt!

167
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,740
Ready, aim...

168
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,710
Fire!

169
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,900
Left face!

170
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,730
Fire!

171
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,610
As I thought, that's enough
destructive power to blow off

172
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,080
our limbs if they hit us head-on!

173
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
Lucky! There are some windows.

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,800
Koichi, this is the second floor,

175
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,020
but we're gonna bust out
those windows and dive out.

176
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,420
I guess I was a bit naïve...

177
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,540
Just great... They have helicopters, too?

178
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,430
Those look like the American
army's Apache helicopters.

179
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,450
Look out! There's a tank!

180
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,760
You're right. They have tanks, too.

181
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,050
Koichi, be caref—

182
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,100
What?

183
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,520
Wh-What did you just say,
Koichi? Can you see them?

184
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,150
These soldiers, tanks, and helicopters...

185
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,330
You can see them clearly?

186
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,650
Yeah. I'm not sure what's
going on, but I can see them.

187
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,060
Could it be that since you were shot by
that arrow, you became a Stand user?

188
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,370
Oh? So the little shrimp

189
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,790
has the power to use a Stand now?

190
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,780
There you are, Okuyasu's big bro.

191
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,130
You've got some guts,
showing yourself like that!

192
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,280
My Stand, Worse Company,
has unbreakable defense.

193
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,810
It's an army that won't let
any invader leave alive.

194
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm sure you want to beat me...

195
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,250
But I can tell you right now that
your Shining Diamond's attacks

196
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,350
will never reach me.

197
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,740
Look! Do you see my army's
beautiful formation?

198
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,540
All units, maintain battle
formation! At ease!

199
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,920
It feels so good when they're
so beautifully together.

200
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,370
Though I'm a bit pissed off
that their formation is

201
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,350
a little off, since you
killed two or three of them.

202
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,350
You sure are methodical.

203
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,860
You came out here just to explain that?

204
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,440
No, the reason I came out here

205
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,830
is to watch you, brat.

206
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,070
M-Me?

207
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,270
That's right.

208
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,500
Koichi, was it?

209
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,770
It seems, despite my expectations,
you had the aptitude to be a Stand user.

210
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,900
Make your Stand appear right now,
and show me what it can do.

211
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,550
You might have the ability
that I've been looking for.

212
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,680
If you have that ability, I'll let you live.

213
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,660
B-But...

214
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,610
The ability you're looking for?

215
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,060
What the hell are you after?

216
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,560
You're in no position to be
asking questions, Josuke!

217
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,170
My decision to kill you hasn't changed!

218
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,880
Be thankful that you get to live a bit longer.

219
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,070
That's just great.

220
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,070
Hey, what're you doing?

221
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,860
Make your Stand appear, brat!

222
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,410
S-Stand? I have no idea what's going on...

223
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh? It's your first time? I see!

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,850
Fine! Josuke, show him how
to make a Stand appear!

225
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,630
Huh?

226
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,150
Your Shining Diamond's range
is less than one meter.

227
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,260
If that shrimp's Stand's ability
is able to compensate for yours,

228
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,550
you might be able to escape my Company.

229
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,690
True... It'd be great if it's a
Stand that can kick your ass.

230
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,810
Okay, getting your Stand to
come out is easy, Koichi.

231
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,870
You just need to feel like

232
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,950
you want to protect yourself,
or you want to kick his ass.

233
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,570
Huh?

234
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,060
The rest is just instinct.

235
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,910
A Stand that's unique to your
mentality should come out.

236
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,290
W-Wait! I can't understand
all this out of nowhere!

237
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,260
You don't understand?

238
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,550
Then I guess we'll just have to put
you in a situation that makes you!

239
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,330
Do it, Green Beret!

240
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,340
Boom

241
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,280
What?!

242
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,230
That's...

243
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,540
Hey, Koichi, try moving it.

244
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,900
M-Move what?

245
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,860
That Stand!

246
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,160
Stand?

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,700
I-I made this appear?!

248
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,650
What happens after this?

249
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,430
What kind of abilities does
this egg-shaped thing have?

250
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,840
Abilities? I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this is all I can do!

251
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,240
This is it!

252
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,230
What? That's it?!

253
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,350
This Stand...

254
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,320
That's enough! That's all I need to know!

255
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
All units, battle positions!

256
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,170
Koichi, withdraw your Stand.

257
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,730
If they attack that thing, you'll die, too!

258
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,750
Withdraw? How do I make it withdraw?!

259
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,090
Commence attack!

260
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,210
Kablow

261
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,960
J-Josuke!

262
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,310
Good. Now Koichi and Josuke
have been separated.

263
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,440
The crack in that egg...

264
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,200
The brat hasn't realized it yet,
but it might be something worthwhile.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,230
The only one who's going
to die right now is Josuke.

266
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,100
Ow...

267
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,410
Hey, Okuyasu's big bro,

268
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,480
if you're going to use an attack
flashy enough to destroy this house,

269
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm gonna do the same.

270
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,760
Let's make this just great.

271
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,610
Josuke Higashikata...

272
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,620
Is it true that you hate it when anyone
says anything insulting about your hair?

273
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,320
Why don't you try insulting it?
Just to test that out.

274
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,290
No, there's no need.

275
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Because I'm going to declare that I'll

276
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,790
blow off the head that your hair sits on.

277
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,840
First, my Worse Company is
going to shoot your legs.

278
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,700
You won't be able to run away then.

279
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,200
Next, we'll damage your arm.

280
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,430
Then you won't be able to guard yourself.

281
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,020
And then, I declare that I'm gonna blow
your brains out, along with your hair.

282
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,910
I see. That's a flawless plan...

283
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,150
If you ignore the fact that it's impossible!

284
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,100
I'm very methodical, you see.

285
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,360
If I say I'll do something
in a certain order, I will.

286
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,090
That's what a declaration is.

287
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,940
He's wide open...

288
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,530
I just need to make that
Stand thing appear again.

289
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,270
It's only an egg-looking thing,
but if I can make it ram into him,

290
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,580
I might be able to beat him!

291
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,940
I-I'm going to do it! Be confident!

292
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,700
I'm going to beat him!

293
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,020
I'm very interested in your Stand,

294
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,880
so I won't kill you just yet.

295
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,600
You bastard!

296
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,220
All units, charge!

297
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,080
Just like Moses, who parted the
Red Sea and walked across its floor,

298
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I'm gonna make my way through
this army and beat you down!

299
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,090
You fool! My plan is going
exactly as I have declared,

300
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,350
Josuke Higashikata!

301
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
A l-landmine?!

302
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,770
First, damage to your legs!

303
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,800
And now, Apaches, fire your missiles!

304
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,790
My arm...

305
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,630
First your legs, then your arm.

306
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,070
It feels so good when
things go as I've declared.

307
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,870
Let's see if you can stay in
one piece as my Worse Company

308
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:13,330
fires all its missiles, shells, and rounds
into that damaged arm of yours!

309
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,460
You've lost, Josuke Higashikata!

310
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,280
All units!

311
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,510
Get ready to fire at once!

312
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,100
What do you think you're
doing, Josuke Higashikata?

313
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,020
Are you surrendering?

314
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you asking me to let you go?

315
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,300
That's not happening.

316
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,100
All units, fire!

317
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,960
My plan is already finished.

318
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,250
What?!

319
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,670
My missiles that just attacked Josuke's arm...

320
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,760
