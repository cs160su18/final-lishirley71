July 15th (Thurs)  8:30 PM

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,380
This isn't good... This isn't good at all!

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,710
I need to let Yoshikage know!

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,550
Reimi!

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,110
You took this picture, Rohan?

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,810
Yes, why?

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,200
This one is marked. Is there
something wrong with it?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,080
The one you have circled looks a little boy.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,070
Hayato Kawajiri

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,710
Oh, him...

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,730
It's nothing, really.

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,210
He seemed to be snooping around,
so he caught my attention.

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,470
But this boy, Hayato Kawajiri, has the
same last name as this man here.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,570
Huh? Really?

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,470
Look!

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,260
Kosaku Kawajiri

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,180
It's the same.

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
You're the one who
researched this, aren't you?

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,290
They do have the same last name.

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,270
At this rate, Rohan Kishibe will
find his way to Yoshikage!

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,940
July 15th (Thurs)  8:48 PM

23
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,740
Hayato? Hayato!

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,400
Ugh...

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,440
Hayato, I've been calling you!

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,180
You can at least answer me!

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,130
D-Darling...

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,470
I thought it was Hayato in the bath.

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,170
I mean, look at this!

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,910
Hayato left his clothes in the hallway
as if they exploded off of him.

31
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,350
Unlike you, no matter how many
times I warn him, he's such a slob.

32
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,860
And he's not answering me again.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm sure he's probably got his
headphones on, reading manga again.

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,200
Oh! Darling, your fingers are bleeding.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,660
What happened?

36
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,720
We need to put a bandage on it.

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,620
I-I'll do it myself.

38
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,880
I can apply a bandage myself.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Okay...

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,380
I just got my fingers caught
in the door, that's all.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,650
Diamond is Unbreakable

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,650
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,130
July 15th (Thurs)  8:50 PM

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,230
Hayato Kawajiri?

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,790
Are you saying this grade-schooler has
something to do with Yoshikage Kira?

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,010
Episode 35    Bites the Dust, Part 1

47
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,330
We're not 100% sure yet,

48
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,280
but Rohan-sensei said
something bugs him about it.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,620
True, there's something wrong if he's
secretly taking videos of his dad.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,810
So, tomorrow morning,
we're thinking of meeting up

51
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,030
and going to visit Hayato Kawajiri's house.

52
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,900
Apparently, Rohan-sensei's
already found the address.

53
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,590
That bastard Rohan sure works fast.

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,480
All right. I just have
to invite Okuyasu, right?

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,640
And of course, there's Jotaro, too.

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,570
I'll talk to Jotaro.

57
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,780
All right. See you tomorrow at 8:30 AM

58
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,900
at the intersection with the Pepsi sign.

59
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,930
Got it.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,290
8:30, huh? I'm gonna be late for school.

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,000
But if we talk to this kid,
we might find something out.

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,590
Are you okay?

63
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,730
You're acting a bit strange, darling...

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,420
And you look pale.

65
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,830
I told you, it's nothing.

66
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,680
I caught my fingers in the door.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,380
Can you blame me for being pale?

68
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,510
More importantly, can you make me some tea?

69
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,550
I'll be down soon.

70
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,360
Of course.

71
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,810
This just came to me out of the blue,

72
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,150
but lately, I can't help but
think that you're immortal.

73
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,320
I'll go make you that tea now.

74
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,650
If something happens to me,
your secret's going to be found out!

75
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,380
Don't you lay a finger on me or my mom!

76
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,450
This isn't a deal!

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,630
You have to listen to me! Got it?!

78
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,580
You're too naïve!

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,880
Do you really think I would allow that?

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,070
I can't believe you actually
got rid of Hayato.

81
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,210
What a stupid thing to do.

82
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,700
I'm trying to think of what to do right now.

83
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,200
It's no use thinking about it.

84
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,110
I see you made it look like
he fell and hit his head,

85
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,860
but the timing was unfortunate.

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,350
That Rohan Kishibe has started
investigating Hayato Kawajiri.

87
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,930
They're still not positive
that Kosaku Kawajiri is you,

88
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,550
but they're coming to
check this house tomorrow.

89
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,450
It's a bad idea to stay in this house any longer.

90
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,790
Shut up. I'm thinking right now.

91
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,850
Ever since you were a child,
when things didn't go your way

92
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,490
and there was nothing you could do,
you would always bite your nails.

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,970
You poor thing.

94
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,370
You must be in so much despair right now.

95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,030
There's no other way around it.

96
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,130
You're going to have to
leave this town, Yoshikage.

97
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,290
If you go now, you can escape to someplace
they can't follow you, before they find out.

98
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,970
Are you telling me to flee Morioh?

99
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,890
You know very well that I'm done
with living my life in fear,

100
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,860
having to worry about
someone coming after me!

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,070
I will never leave this town.

102
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,690
What?!

103
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,490
The arrow acted on its own!
I didn't do anything!

104
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,000
I didn't even touch the arrow!

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,590
Th-The arrow...

106
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,760
Y-Yoshikage!

107
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,570
Hayato! Hayato?!

108
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,560
July 16th (Fri)  7:30 AM

109
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,070
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

110
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,390
Hurry up and wake—

111
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,580
What, you're already
awake? That's a surprise.

112
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,550
Hayato, breakfast is ready.

113
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,770
Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

114
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,550
I couldn't sleep very well last night.

115
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,780
He... He found out that
I saw him kill someone.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Anyway, I made sure that he
wouldn't be able to lay a finger

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,720
on me or Mom, but...

118
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,270
What should I do now?

119
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,790
I-I don't understand...
What happened, Yoshikage?

120
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,510
You've been acting strange since last night.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,060
Listen to me, Yoshikage!

122
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,990
That Rohan Kishibe has started investigating
Hayato Kawajiri for some reason!

123
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,580
They're going to come
check this house tomorrow.

124
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,400
There's no need to worry.

125
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,230
B-But, Yoshikage!

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,830
Deadly Queen has gained a third ability.

127
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,250
I... I don't understand.

128
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,420
What could have happened
to make you so carefree?

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,950
Miso-stewed Cow Tongue

130
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,950
-Morioh's Very Own-

131
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,360
Miso-stewed cow tongue.

132
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,770
What? No way! We're on the air already?

133
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,720
Er, um... It's now 7:55, so here's
the weather today for the prefecture.

134
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,940
Today should be sunny.

135
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,060
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

136
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,090
After that bath last night, he changed.

137
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,480
Wh-What could have happened?

138
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,910
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

139
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,860
Crash

140
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,380
My precious tea set!

141
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,080
This is all your fault!

142
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,260
Why do you always ignore me?!

143
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,720
Fine! You think your mother's
just a bother, right?!

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,590
Do whatever you want, then!

145
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,390
Now, now. Let's not fight
first thing in the morning.

146
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,520
If it broke, I'll just buy you another one.

147
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,650
Hello, Kawajiri residence.

148
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,790
No, it's not.

149
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,660
They had the wrong number.

150
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,670
Hayato's just at an age where
he doesn't want to talk much.

151
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,320
We're family, so we all need to get along.

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
You know, get along.

153
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,500
Well, I'll head off to work now.

154
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,270
Do you mind if I give you a goodbye kiss?

155
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,260
Huh?

156
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,050
I'll be off now.

157
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,890
H-He left...

158
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,820
No, I'm right here.

159
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,400
Why don't we walk together part of the way?

160
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,090
Going from feeling refreshed
to falling into despair...

161
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,050
So much has happened lately.
I've been on an emotional roller coaster.

162
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,500
But now I'll be able to feel at ease.

163
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,010
Since you cornered me last
night, I was able to mature.

164
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,800
Really, your will last night was so strong.

165
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,230
To think that you would actually turn
around and threaten me, Yoshikage Kira...

166
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,620
Y-Yoshikage Kira?

167
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,620
Did I just say my real name?

168
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,180
A-Are you planning to kill me after all?

169
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,380
Kill you?

170
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,800
Because you found out my secret?

171
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,630
There's no need for that.
Because I've matured.

172
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,660
No matter where you go and
what you do with anyone,

173
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,930
it doesn't matter, because
now, none can rival me.

174
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,310
I have no interest in you anymore.
If I wanted to kill you...

175
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,770
I would have gotten rid of you last night.

176
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,770
From now on, we're all going to get
along and live happily together.

177
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,970
So just relax... Like we're family.

178
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,490
Well, I have to head to the station.

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,490
Make sure you study hard, Hayato.

180
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,890
Rival... He just said none can rival him...

181
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,010
Which means there must be others

182
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,590
that have the same kind of abilities as him.

183
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,750
But what's with that creepy confidence?

184
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,490
If he's unrivaled now, does that mean
he's gained some other abilities?

185
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,730
What should I do?

186
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,210
What am I supposed to do?

187
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,440
You're...

188
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,230
Hayato Kawajiri-kun,

189
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,820
aren't you?

190
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,270
De

191
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,310
Dead

192
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,410
Deadly

193
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,490
Deadly Qu

194
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:30,530
Deadly Que

195
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:30,620
Deadly Quee

196
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,950
Deadly Queen

197
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,700
Ko

198
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:31,790
Kosaku

199
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,910
Kosaku Kawa

200
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,950
Kosaku Kawajiri

201
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,240
July 16th (Fri)  8:24 AM

202
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,300
I've been waiting for you.

203
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,580
My name is Rohan Kishibe.

204
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,800
There's something that I wanted
to ask you out of curiosity.

205
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,440
It's about this picture.

206
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,130
This is you, right?

207
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,760
Were you taking video of your
dad in the corner there?

208
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,270
Wait.

209
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,230
What... is this?

210
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,190
Well, I know that was sudden...

211
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,380
But it's much faster to just read

212
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,870
about Hayato Kawajiri than
to ask bothersome questions,

213
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,160
and I can get honest answers this way, too.

214
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,270
[Warning]

215
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,270
You mustn't
read any further.

216
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,240
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

217
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,820
What Heaven's Door turns into a book

218
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,070
should just be the memories of this boy's
life experiences, without any falsehoods.

219
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,800
And yet... a warning?

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,160
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

221
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,170
What in the world is this?

222
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,180
Is this "warning" what he experienced?

223
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,280
I thought I'd just casually
look into this child,

224
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,930
but now this has definitely
caught my interest.

225
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,430
[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

226
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,440
"You mustn't read any further"?

227
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,190
Who in the world could this warning be for?

228
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,490
An old guy walked by with his fly down.

229
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,400
He sneezed and said, "Damn it."

230
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,810
Some women laughed at him.

231
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,080
Wh-What is this?

232
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,130
This is getting even more confusing.

233
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,070
What does it mean?

234
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,270
Damn it.

235
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,470
J-Just who is this boy?

236
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,750
It rained.

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,050
Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!

238
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,350
At 8:27 AM, lightning struck
above the Pepsi sign.

239
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,190
8:27...

240
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,200
Wh-Who in the world is this Hayato Kawajiri?

241
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,370
Why is he experiencing things in the future?

242
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,580
Could he be a Stand user?

243
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,580
No... This is too odd to be a Stand ability.

244
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,500
All I can read with Heaven's Door

245
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,760
is what he has personally seen or heard.

246
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,880
The answer to this should
be written somewhere...

247
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,290
My dad isn't my dad

248
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,010
He made a man and a woman disappear at an apartment in Jozenji by making them explode.

249
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,510
He's a murderer. I found out who
he was. He has inhuman abilities.

250
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,010
My dad's name is Yoshikage Kira

251
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,030
Yoshikage Kira

252
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,690
Kira...

253
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,410
I-I did it!

254
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,590
This kid was the jackpot!

255
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,080
I finally found him!

256
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,030
Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri!

257
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,880
He's disguised himself as this kid's father!

258
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,630
Ro

259
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:32,960
ha

260
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,300
n

261
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,620
Kishi

262
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:33,970
be

263
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:34,300
was

264
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,640
also

265
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:34,960
ki

266
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,300
ll

267
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,760
ed

268
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,010
"Rohan Kishibe was also killed"?

269
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,020
"He was killed by Kira,

270
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,010
He was killed by Kira,
who had matured.

271
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,370
who had matured..."

272
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,400
Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

273
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,030
Heaven's Door!

274
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,210
Rohan Kishibe, Deadly Queen
is already inside your eye!

275
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,080
That is what you are seeing!

276
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,460
The switch for Deadly Queen's third bomb

277
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,220
has already been activated!

278
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,600
Deadly Queen's third ability...

279
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,440
It is a bomb to blow away anyone
who tries to come after me!

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,110
It will activate in anyone who tries to get
close to Hayato in order to learn about me.

281
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:40,120
Rohan Kishibe was also killed.

282
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:40,120
He was killed by Kira,
who had matured.

283
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,660
It'll also activate if Hayato happens
to verbally reveal my identity,

284
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,110
and if he writes it down,
it'll activate immediately.

285
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,020
Which means it's a bomb
I implanted in Hayato!

286
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,120
C-Come to think of it,

287
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,710
I was supposed to meet Koichi
and the others here at 8:30...

288
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,720
I finally... found out Yoshikage Kira's identity...

289
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,840
Koichi is coming. I have to tell him...

290
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,870
I... I finally... found him...

291
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,820
Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri.

292
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,120
I found him with my Heaven's Door.

293
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,650
I have to tell...

294
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,920
Koichi...

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,630
And now,

296
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,710
this is the real third
ability of Deadly Queen!

297
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,690
K-Koichi!

298
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,690
I-It was a dream?

299
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,200
I couldn't sleep very well last night.

300
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,880
I kept having these weird dreams...

301
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,420
Hayato!

302
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,630
Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

303
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,280
Hurry up and wake—

304
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,440
What, you're already awake?

305
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,720
That's a surprise.

306
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,680
Hayato, breakfast is ready.

307
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,970
Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

308
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,350
D-Didn't this...

309
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,300
What? No way! We're on the air already?

310
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,400
Th-This morning TV program...

311
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,690
Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

312
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,570
Th-This isn't a dream...

313
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,830
What I just saw wasn't a dream.

314
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,490
Th-This is the same morning.

315
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,520
It's repeating...

316
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,340
Today's morning is repeating again!

317
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,590
Yoshikage Kira... His name is Yoshikage Kira!

318
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,890
He's doing this!

319
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,840
This is the unrivaled ability
he was talking about,

320
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,500
and he planted that inside me!

321
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,550
Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

322
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, yeah!

323
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,530
Look out—

324
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Ow...

325
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,690
That was a nice catch. It was almost
as if you knew it was going to fall.

326
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,290
But if you can hear me,
you could at least answer!

327
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,270
Hello, Kawajiri residence.

328
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,560
Huh? No, it's not.

329
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,560
It appears I'm the only one
in the world who's aware

330
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,680
that this morning is repeating.

331
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,340
It's almost as if you knew, huh?

332
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,130
Apparently you blew someone
up and came back, Hayato.

333
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,700
No, really. I don't know
exactly what you've done.

334
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,190
This is called Deadly Queen Bites the Dust,

335
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,360
and it automatically protects me...

336
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,930
from inside you, Hayato.

337
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,250
Did you know that I already
killed you once last night?

338
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,730
As though as it was trying to remedy

339
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,530
the despair I was feeling
from the situation I was in,

340
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,800
I gained a brand new ability.

341
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:29,020
By using that ability on you,
time went back an hour,

342
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,050
and the fact that I killed you disappeared.

343
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,920
At the same time,
you became a bomb to protect me.

344
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,860
You told someone about me and the
bomb activated, and then you came back.

345
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,320
Who did you blow away, hm? Come on, tell me.

346
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,210
Who did you kill?

347
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,080
I-I didn't tell anyone...

348
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,970
I see! Then someone must have
been asking you questions.

349
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,870
It must be that Rohan Kishibe.

350
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,030
Even if you have no intention
of telling anyone,

351
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,220
as soon as someone asks you about me,
Bites the Dust will activate.

352
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,970
And then you will blow him up and come back.

353
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,930
The very fact that Rohan Kishibe
encountered you has disappeared!

354
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,890
That is Deadly Queen Bites the Dust.

355
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,430
You won't be able to tell anyone.

356
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,590
There will be no one who
can ask you anything!
