2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,800
Don't touch those dice, Josuke Higashikata!

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,120
Don't move an inch.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,670
What's he going to do?

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,710
If Rohan finds out that I've been
using that alien to cheat...

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,340
Knowing him,

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,370
just apologizing is definitely
not going to cut it.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,570
What are you checking?

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,680
I could be imagining it, but I feel
like the dice are staring at me.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Gulp.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,460
Ba-dum, ba-dum...

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,480
Hmph. Well, whatever.
Let's continue the game.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,770
Rohan... Adds 30 New Chips

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,280
W-Well, then... I'll go easy and just bet two.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,520
You get it now, right, Alien?

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,300
I need to just manage to win.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,240
I just need to be a tiny bit ahead in the end.

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,430
All right, go!

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,670
H-He doesn't get it!

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,160
I guess what happens twice is
bound to happen a third time.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,350
I suppose it's possible to
roll this more than once.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,100
An omen is worth five times the bet, yes?

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,810
I'll pay up.

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,730
That's what came up, so it can't be helped.

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,030
Right... I guess things that happen
twice can happen a third time.

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,680
Diamond is Unbreakable

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

28
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,780
Episode 28     Highway Go Go, Part 1

29
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,000
Wh-Wh-Wha...

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,320
What the hell are you doing?!

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm not sure how, but I
know that you're cheating.

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,550
That's unforgivable...

33
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,010
It's unforgivable that I can't figure it out!

34
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,260
Dude, you're messed up in the head!

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,920
You're infuriating.

36
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,650
Up until now, I've held back
my anger toward you

37
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,450
for Mr. Joestar and Koichi's sakes,

38
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,270
but you are currently trying
to make a fool of me.

39
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,110
Just thinking about you laughing
deep down inside is unbearable.

40
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,610
Let me see your hand.
I'll have Shining Diamond fix it.

41
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,370
Shut up!

42
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,910
Do you know why I did that to my pinky?

43
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,790
So that you won't be able to forfeit
the game, Josuke Higashikata!

44
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,800
I won't let a doofus like you
underestimate the great Rohan!

45
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,780
We'll both just play one more time.

46
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,880
In that time, I swear I will
figure out how you're cheating.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,020
If I am unable to determine
how you're cheating...

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,710
There's two million yen there.

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,330
I'll use that to ask you to fix
my pinky with Shining Diamond.

50
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,530
However, if I figure out how you're cheating,

51
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,160
I'm going to take your
pinky, Josuke Higashikata.

52
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,490
Hey, you two look like you're having fun.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,240
Hey, it's me. Been a while, Josuke!

54
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,190
I was stuck in the hospital for a month.

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,670
I don't really remember how,

56
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,340
but apparently I hurt my
head on the side of the road.

57
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,490
Tamami?

58
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,070
What the hell are you doing here?

59
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,230
I called him earlier and asked
him to act as an official.

60
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,560
An official?

61
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,010
I'm Tamami Kobayashi.

62
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,070
I will make sure the contracted promise
is promptly and surely collected,

63
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,910
using this lock that attaches to your heart.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,810
I will work fairly, no matter
who wins or who is involved.

65
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,850
I charge 20%, or 400,000 yen,
whichever sum is larger.

66
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,740
You will both play one more time

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,940
and see if you can figure out
the cheat or not, correct?

68
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,890
Yeah.

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,800
What?!

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,510
However, you can also get
out of this by not cheating,

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,050
so I will ensure that doesn't happen.

72
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,520
Should you win without cheating,

73
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,110
I will create a rule where Tamami's
lock will automatically attack you.

74
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,860
This really isn't good... But I have to do this!

75
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,860
I have to keep the cheat going to
the end and break through this!

76
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,950
Well, then... I'll go first.

77
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
How's that?!

78
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,170
A four!

79
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,380
A pair of three's and a four!

80
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,170
Yes! That throw ended up
being normal "naturally."

81
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,760
Now he won't find out.

82
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,020
I-It's my turn next, right?

83
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,410
Hmph. You look rather relieved.

84
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,220
It's as though something you
asked someone to do went well.

85
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,250
Don't get rattled. Rohan hasn't figured it out.

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,190
I'm just going to keep playing!

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,540
H-He threw up?!

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,540
C-Crap! He's getting dizzy!

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,830
It's because Rohan shook him around so much.

90
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,070
Josuke! Don't you dare hide
the dice with your hand.

91
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,800
Huh?

92
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,610
I can't see them.

93
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,330
You need to throw the dice so I can see them.

94
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,180
Huh? I wonder if there's a fire somewhere.

95
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,340
Wh-What? Sirens?!

96
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,520
Th-This guy's allergic to sirens.

97
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,570
Crap! He's going to turn back!

98
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,820
What are you doing? You're being suspicious!

99
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,950
Show me what's in your hand at once!

100
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,620
Sorry so sudden, but that was
a yell to get me hyped up!

101
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,160
I'll throw now!

102
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,050
Go! Do it!

103
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a 666 omen!

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,350
The lock didn't move. Josuke is cheating!

105
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,100
Well? Did you figure it out, Rohan-sensei?

106
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,990
Or are you admitting defeat, Rohan-sensei?

107
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,440
Looks like the rash isn't
showing up on Rohan's side.

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,810
Please hang in there!

109
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,960
Did you figure it out or not?

110
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm done for...

111
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,960
That's... I've got it!

112
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,880
He knows!

113
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,720
I've got it! The fire's here!

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,450
Huh?!

115
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,470
Rohan-sensei, your house is on fire!

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,790
It's the magnifying glass!

117
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,980
The magnifying glass caused the fire!

118
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,060
We were too busy with
the game to even notice!

119
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,270
Shut up! I don't care if my house is burning!

120
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,190
It's more important that I figure
out how Josuke is cheating!

121
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,840
What are you talking about?!

122
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,070
You have to get out of here,
and take your two million!

123
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,070
W-Well, I'll be going now...

124
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,620
Wait, Josuke!

125
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,160
But first, I'm going to fix your pinky.

126
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,210
No one asked you to do that!

127
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,780
Josuke, wait! You bastard!

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,610
That was close... But I guess I have a way
of making people resent me, huh?

129
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,220
I had no idea.

130
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,450
You seem down.

131
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,810
Was I able to be of use to you?

132
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,790
Sh-Shut up, jeez!

133
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:14,770
Rohan Kishibe's House: 7,000,000 yen in fire damage

134
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:14,770
Josuke:        Didn't really lose anything,
.                   but managed to make Rohan's grudge
.                   toward him even deeper

135
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,420
Rohan Kishibe's house:
7,000,000 yen in fire damage.

136
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,820
Josuke: Didn't really lose anything,

137
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,780
but managed to make Rohan's
grudge toward him even deeper.

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Kawajiri Kosaku
Shinobu
Hayato

139
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,590
Now, all you drivers out there,
please be careful when driving.

140
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,050
It seems a motorcycle crashed at the
entrance of Futatsumori Tunnel yesterday,

141
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,700
and the young rider was badly injured.

142
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,970
Police later found out...

143
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,880
Lately, Mom's been acting strange.

144
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,510
She's been dressing up, she got new lipstick,

145
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,100
and she's in a good mood...

146
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,100
Did something happen?

147
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,030
It's been a while since Mom
got naked in front of Dad.

148
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,780
Am I a child that was born to
parents who loved each other?

149
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,130
What's he doing?

150
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,630
Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...

151
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,640
It's their fault I'm in this mess.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,410
Oh, Josuke-san. Thank you for yesterday.

153
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,620
Where did you sleep and eat
after what happened yesterday?

154
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,780
Mikitaka! Mikitaka!

155
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,470
You need to stay right behind me!

156
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,040
We just moved here,
so there's a lot we must do.

157
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,900
All right, Mother. I'll be right there.

158
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,040
H-Huh?

159
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't tell me you're pulling
jokes on people again

160
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,800
by telling them you're an alien.

161
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,870
If he said that to you,
please don't think anything of it.

162
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,960
At his last school in Tokyo,
people took it seriously,

163
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,010
and there was a lot of trouble.

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,060
Now, if you'll excuse us.

165
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,560
Huh? What?!

166
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,690
I brainwashed her into
thinking that I'm her son.

167
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,570
The name "Mikitaka Hazekura"
is the name I'm using on Earth.

168
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,880
See ya!

169
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,820
Mikitaka! Come here this instant!

170
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,820
Mikitaka Hazekura...Alien or Stand User?!

171
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,100
H-Huh?

172
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,380
Huh?!

173
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,590
What was that?

174
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,580
What was with that brat?

175
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,020
Was he actually an alien?

176
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,370
Or was he a Stand user created
by this arrow when it hurt him?

177
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,600
The way he pulled Josuke and Rohan
Kishibe apart was very effective...

178
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,210
But!

179
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,370
Next time, the next Stand, Highway Go Go,

180
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,580
will defeat those who go after my son!

181
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,630
Why are you avoiding eye contact with me?

182
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,600
You should at least greet me.

183
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,980
After all, I am older than
you, Josuke Higashikata.

184
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,100
Sorry about yesterday.

185
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,650
Th-That fire must have been a lot of trouble.

186
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes. Just like in the movie Pretty Woman,

187
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,980
about 2,500,000 yen worth
of furniture was burned.

188
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,370
Not that I care in the least.

189
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,240
What's wrong? Sit down.

190
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,240
Someday, I will pay you back
for yesterday's dice game.

191
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,420
What?

192
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,000
That was...

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,770
Josuke, did you see that?

194
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,420
There was a door to a house in the tunnel wall.

195
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,220
There's someone inside!

196
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,620
There's a window, too!

197
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,550
There's a room in the tunnel wall.

198
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,720
A room that someone lives in!

199
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
There's a man, too!

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
But I can't see either of their faces!

201
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,270
What is he doing?!

202
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,230
Josuke, did you see that?!

203
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,040
Shut the hell up, Rohan Kishibe!

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,150
How long are you going
to try to mess with me?!

205
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,610
Can no one else see it?

206
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,630
Is that house... a new Stand user?

207
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,800
The man who cut off that woman's hand...

208
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,170
Could he be...

209
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,830
Yoshikage Kira?!

210
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,940
Morioh Landmark 8
"Futatsumori Tunnel"

211
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,940
Completed in year 5 of the Kaei
Period (1852). Fixed in year 28 of
the Showa Period. 450 meters in
length. Is on the road connecting
S City and Morioh. Because it is
curved inside, the exit is not visible
from the entrance. As there is very
little light, there are many
accidents, and since is it rather
creepy, it's considered haunted
by young people.

212
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,700
Futatsumori
Tunnel

213
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,700
There was a room inside the tunnel?!

214
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,420
You're not fooling me!

215
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,990
You want to get back at me by
telling me a stupid lie like that?

216
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,410
You don't believe me, Josuke Higashikata?

217
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,920
A liar like you who cheats with dice...

218
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,930
A liar like you who always does
something different from what he says,

219
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,300
has the nerve to call me a liar?

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,970
It appears we truly do not get along.

221
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,310
I guess you wouldn't understand,
even if you went back there with me.

222
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,480
All right, let's go.

223
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,580
That's the exit.

224
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,720
There was nothing there.

225
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,800
There was nothing here but a wall.

226
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,820
Maybe it really was an illusion.

227
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,050
What?!

228
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,300
Crash

229
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,810
Th-This is...

230
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,070
Th-The room I saw from the bus.

231
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,430
It appeared out of nowhere!

232
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,290
Though the man and woman
I saw earlier aren't here.

233
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,590
Crap! Something's there!

234
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,300
So this room was a trap after all!

235
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,800
It's coming... Something's there!

236
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,850
I can't see it, but something's coming at me!

237
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,550
Something came toward me.

238
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,940
I couldn't see it, but it came right toward me.

239
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,280
It was something not human.

240
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,150
That room was a trap.

241
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,780
The man that resembled
Kira was also an illusion.

242
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,000
Now I know that room is a Stand.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,790
I can't handle it alone.
Should I tell Mr. Joestar about it?

244
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,790
What? It's chasing after me!

245
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,590
What is that?!

246
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,200
These... These things that
look like footprints...

247
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,550
Are they the Stand?

248
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,970
60km/h!

249
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,740
I managed to get away.

250
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,310
Apparently if I go faster than
60km/h, it can't keep up.

251
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,310
Is it being remotely controlled?

252
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,900
What?!

253
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,000
Crap! It caught up to me!

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,910
I only slowed down a little bit!

255
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,030
Th-This thing...

256
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,130
I'll turn it into a book and control it!

257
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,660
Heaven's Door!

258
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,210
Crap... It's sucking out my power...

259
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,100
I know I just said that I never
wanted to see Rohan again,

260
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,250
but here I am.

261
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,390
I'm a liar who always does something
different from what he says.

262
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,650
What?!

263
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,760
W-Wait... C-Could this be...

264
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,240
Rohan's motorcycle? Only the motorcycle?!

265
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,400
Smash

266
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,080
Th-That thing...

267
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,170
Give me nutrients...
Give me your nutrients!

268
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,880
Heaven's Door!

269
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,320
The Stand's name is Highway Go Go.

270
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,840
That room was a trap.

271
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,650
When a curious passer-by enters that room,

272
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,820
it'll go any distance to chase them down,

273
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,790
like a hunting dog on a scent,
then it sucks out their nutrients.

274
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,350
Once one is touched by
Highway Go Go, its weak spot...

275
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,360
Its weak spot...

276
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,360
d-doesn't exist?!

277
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,860
I-It's no use... I don't have any strength.

278
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,590
I can't read any more.

279
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,570
I-I'm losing more and more power...

280
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,370
I can't even write an order on him...

281
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,020
I can't...

282
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,680
Rohan!

283
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,380
Hey, are you here, Rohan?!

284
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,690
Josuke... I can't believe you came back...

285
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,350
A comrade...

286
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,890
Your name is Rohan?

287
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,850
Hey, Rohan! Answer me! Where are you?

288
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,110
Rohan!

289
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,270
Th-That's...

290
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,820
R-Rohan?!

291
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,630
Go on, Rohan... Ask him to save you.

292
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,580
Call out for help.

293
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,230
What the hell is that room?

294
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,580
Are you all right?!

295
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,500
I've left just a bit of your nutrients in you.

296
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,950
If you ask him for help,
I'll spare your life.

297
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,220
Because I'll take his nutrients instead.

298
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,360
Now... Help me lure him into this room.

299
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,480
I'll spare your life. Hurry up and call him.

300
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
What the hell is this room?

301
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,190
It almost looks as if someone lives in it!

302
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,230
Hurry up and say it.

303
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,020
Look! He's suspicious,
so he won't come any closer.

304
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,530
It's not like you two love each other, is it?

305
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,340
I told you to ask him for help.

306
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,960
Do you want to die?

307
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,660
I-If I lure him in here...

308
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,210
If I offer him up instead,

309
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,840
w-will you really...

310
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,700
spare my life?

311
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,800
Yeah, I promise.

312
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,360
It'll be a give-and-take in
exchange for his nutrients.

313
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,700
Call him. Hurry up and call him!

314
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,310
I refuse.

315
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,790
What?!

316
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,080
One of my absolute favorite things to do

317
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,660
is to tell someone who
I think is strong, "no."

318
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,540
Run, Josuke!

319
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,240
If you come into this room,
you have no chance!

320
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,420
You'll be killed!

321
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,380
You bastard!

322
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,970
Do you really think I'd run away

323
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,360
because someone told me to run away?

324
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
I'll kick his ass.

325
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Where is he?

326
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,930
Where's the bastard hiding?

327
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,440
H—

328
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,860
How can you do this, Josuke Higashikata?

329
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,200
I even told you of the danger...

330
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
You always do the opposite
of what I think you'll do.

331
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,870
And that's why I hate you.

332
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,870
That's why you piss me off!
You're going to be attacked!

333
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,460
Now he's got your scent!

334
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,160
Smash Crush Smash

335
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,460
Yes! I got him!

336
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,220
Heaven's Door!

337
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,590
Your body will fly
backwards at 70km/h!

338
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,850
Josuke, Highway Go Go will
follow you anywhere at 60km/h!

339
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,330
Look for the user!

340
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,730
The only way for you to survive
is to defeat the user!

341
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,110
Shut up already, you idiot!

342
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,610
Rohan!

343
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,080
Rohan Kishibe...

344
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,830
To think that you'd actually save me...

345
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,630
It's... It's unbelievable, but I'm moved!

346
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,640
All right, Rohan.

347
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,390
I just have to find that thing's user, right?

348
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,400
I just need to find the user and kick his ass!

349
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,810
Wait for me, Rohan!

350
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,430
