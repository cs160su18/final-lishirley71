00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,450
Hey, apparently Koichi's
family doesn't know, either.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,360
They were talking about
possibly calling the police.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,610
So he is missing. And since
Yukako isn't here, either...

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,300
I sort of feel responsible.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,860
You don't think he's dead, do you?

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,260
Nah, I doubt she's gone that far yet.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,440
She must be keeping him somewhere.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
We need to find him, and fast.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,960
This might end up being
a life or death situation.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,620
It won't open!

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,210
This is awful!

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,710
Q.
What year did Columbus
discover the new continent?
The answer is the lock's combination.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,100
It was also a movie title, wasn't it?

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,480
But it looked really long,
so I didn't watch it.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,790
I've almost got it...

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,240
1, 4, 0, 0...

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,240
Um...

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,930

Episode 9  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 2

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,210
I washed your underwear and
your pajama pants for you.

23
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,050
What's wrong?

24
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,490
I won't know if you don't say anything.

25
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,080
I-I'm a first-year in high school...

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,160
This is just the worst.

27
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,690
This goes beyond being embarrassed.
I feel like an awful human being.

28
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,040
Please, stop this already.

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,190
You hate me now, don't you?

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,010
You think I'm pathetic, don't you?

31
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,420
Just let me go home already.

32
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,060
What could you possibly like
about me, after I peed my pants?

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,390
Oh, you poor thing, Koichi.

34
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,380
I must be tormenting your heart.

35
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm a bad girl.

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,230
Nothing I say does any good!

37
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,770
I-I can feel tears starting to well up...

38
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,890
First I wet my pants, and now
I'm getting wet with tears?

39
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,810
But Koichi...

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,770
After saying that you're
an awful human being,

41
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,860
I can see something shining, something
invigorating, deep in your eyes.

42
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,590
Like you still have a trump
card hidden up your sleeve.

43
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,410
That's what I like about you.

44
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,150
I would love to see what that is.

45
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,730
And if it belongs to someone you love,

46
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,580
there's nothing wrong with
even poop or snot, right?

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,730
It's strange that you'd even worry.

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,360
I felt true bliss while I was washing your pants.

49
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,010
Look!

50
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,700
I'm working on a chair that has
electricity running through it.

51
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,530
I'll make sure it's done by dinner study time.

52
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,490
I'm thinking about making Italian for dinner.

53
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,900
I should go buy some olive oil.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Look forward to it.

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,040
H-Help me!

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,640
She's just getting worse!

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
I have to hurry and escape,

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,970
o-or she's seriously going to kill me!

59
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,310
But...

60
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,800
How am I going to escape?

61
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,490
Koichi's got Reverb, though.

62
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,780
With that thing, he can still call for
help even if he's being gagged, right?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,660
But Reverb's range is about 50 meters.

64
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,470
He might've been taken to a place
where no one else lives nearby.

65
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,020
There are tons of places like that.

66
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,420
Wait!

67
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,880
She said she was going
to buy some olive oil.

68
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,980
But I can't imagine her going out
shopping in this situation.

69
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,060
Is she going to order by phone, then?

70
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,010
Could it be...

71
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,050
There it is! A pay phone!

72
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,190
48 meters! Yes!

73
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,510
It's just within my range!

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,380
Reverb is a sound Stand!

75
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,910
Now I can signal Josuke for help.

76
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,870
I don't have any 10 yen coins!

77
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,850
I was wearing pajamas
when I was brought here.

78
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,740
Should I dial 110?

79
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,160
But that woman might
actually kill the police.

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm just going to have to
contact Josuke somehow!

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,760
You were wondering if there was
a pay phone nearby, weren't you?

82
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,780
Y-Yukako...

83
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,220
I know exactly what you're thinking.

84
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,080
You heard me say that I was
going to get some olive oil,

85
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,220
so there must be a pay phone nearby.

86
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,380
But even if you were to get to it,
you don't have any 10 yen coins.

87
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,980
That's what you were thinking, right?

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
I-Is there a pay phone?

89
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,750
Hmph. Playing dumb, I see.

90
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,900
You should abandon the idea
of trying to call someone.

91
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,250
You wont be able to set
foot outside of this house.

92
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,760
Just in case, I'm going to go destroy
the 110 button on the phone.

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,730
Is there anything that you'd like?

94
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,010
N-No, not really...

95
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,100
Wh-What is wrong with her?!

96
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,080
I guess it's no use... I can't contact anyone...

97
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,060
Beep
Boop
Beep
Boop
Beep

98
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,320
What are these letters?

99
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,540
There's suddenly sound
coming from my hand...

100
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,340
It's calling somewhere!

101
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,120
I haven't even dialed the phone number yet.

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,220
Hello? This is Higashikata.

103
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,840
It connected!

104
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,310
As long as the call sounds go through,
calls on those phones will be connected.

105
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,980
Hello, is this Koichi?
Hey! It's me, Josuke!

106
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,900
Koichi, where are you?

107
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,900
What? I can hear the sound of waves...

108
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,800
Koichi, you...

109
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,160
You have a power like I do, don't you?

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,500
Yes! Now Josuke will definitely come here!

111
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,590
It'll only take 15 to 20 minutes by car.

112
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,520
I just have to survive until then!

113
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,420
N-No matter what!

114
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,110
The sound of waves... A pay phone...

115
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,370
The place Koichi is...

116
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,710
It's gotta be here!

117
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,470
Koichi.

118
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,060
Koichi!

119
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
She's coming back!

120
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,060
I-I've got no choice but to fight!

121
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,040
Open the door, Koichi.

122
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,190
Wh-Why don't you just break the door down?

123
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,090
If Josuke sees a broken door,
he'll definitely think something's wrong.

124
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm very happy right now.

125
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,320
I'm so happy that you have
powers like I do, Koichi.

126
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,220
Though it pisses me off that
you were hiding that from me.

127
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,190
But I'm still very happy.

128
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,890
Because the most important thing for
a man and a woman living together

129
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,040
is love, and having the same
goals and values, right?

130
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,330
We have something in common
that no one else has.

131
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,850
We have the ultimate compatibility.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,890
So please, Koichi...

133
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,320
Open the door.

134
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,090
I told you to open the door.
Hurry up and open the door!

135
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,260
I hate you

136
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,310
I hate you

137
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,820
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

138
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,590
Th-The ultimate compatibility?!

139
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:11,420
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

140
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,620
Can't you tell how much
I don't want to be here?!

141
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,510
That sound won't go away until you cry,
apologize, and give up on me.

142
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,420
What is this? I don't hear any of this.

143
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,300
I hate you—

144
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,050
Huh?!

145
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,450
Th-This is...

146
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,710
nothing like that time with Tamami.

147
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,880
Her delusions are way too strong!

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,310
I had no idea sh-she'd be this stubborn...

149
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,330
I finally found out that we've
been bound by the one

150
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,190
and only red thread in this world.

151
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,510
Some people never find it at all.

152
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,330
Don't you understand how wonderful that is?

153
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,350
Koichi...

154
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,950
I was going to try to make you into a fine man,

155
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,130
but now things are different.

156
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,510
I won't let you leave this house
until you fall in love with me.

157
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,180
I will make you love me!

158
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,070
Or else...

159
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,490
I might just kill you.

160
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,530
I can't let her in here, no matter what...

161
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,030
I need to attack her with
Reverb one more time!

162
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,370
If I try harder, I'll be able to
produce a louder sound than before.

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,690
Reverb!

164
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,020
Something's wrong with Reverb...

165
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,450
Reverb!

166
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,290
It's not moving!

167
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,470
D-Did it die?

168
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,000
Did my Stand die of utter despair?

169
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,170
Reverb is dead!

170
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,390

Koichi Hirose

178
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,020
N-No! M-My...

179
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,150
My Reverb isn't moving at all!

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,070
Stands use mental ability to move.

181
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,380
I pushed it too far, and then it
got too worked up and died!

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,580
My Reverb...

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,750
What?!

184
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,670
Wh-What is that?

185
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,040
It's called a "Stand"?

186
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,370
What is that Stand?

187
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,380
This shoe cabinet is in my way!

188
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,260
I-I'm going to be killed!

189
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,760
If she comes in the door and catches me,
then sooner or later, I'll be killed!

190
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,770
Open up, Koichi!

191
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,020
Don't come through that door!

192
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,660
If only that door would blow her far away...

193
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,620
It's gone! It's just an empty shell.

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,910
Where did you put it?

195
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,630
Huh?

196
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm asking what happened
to the thing inside that!

197
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,250
Huh?!

198
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,780
Th...

199
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,720
That's...

200
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,430
Wh-What is this? My Reverb

201
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,220
i-isn't dead!

202
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,000
Did it emerge from its old
shell into a new form?

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,100
What is this?

204
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,230
The design's only changed
a little, and it shrank.

205
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,150
Just changing its shape
won't make any difference!

206
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,150
I-It's fast!

207
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,160
Wh-What is

208
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,390
this wind?!

209
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,330
Bam

210
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,210
Sh-She got blown away!

211
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,460
I'm not sure how, but she just got
blown away by something like wind!

212
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,210
Wh-What just...

213
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,330
happened to me?

214
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,920
Reverb's letters are on the door...

215
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,300
Fwoosh

216
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,180
Fwoosh

217
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,520
Because she touched the door with
these words on it, they became real.

218
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,020
Fwoosh

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,550
The sensation of "Fwoosh"
actually blew her away.

220
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,540
Earlier, I wished this door would blow her away...

221
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,620
I guess I was unknowingly controlling it.

222
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,260
This is the new Reverb!

223
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,650
Reverb Act 2!

224
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,330
Koichi...

225
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,670
Teioh

226
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,670
It's those two...

227
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,220
If it's a place near the sea with
a lot of uninhabited houses,

228
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,950
it has to be this area with all the villas.

229
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,180
But there are, like, dozens of villas around here.

230
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,890
We can't tell which one it is.

231
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,810
We have to find the pay phone!
Koichi called us from one.

232
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,300
Let's find the pay phone first and
then look at the houses near it.

233
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,290
Yeah.

234
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,410
Cute little Koichi belongs to me.

235
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,970
I won't let anyone else have him.

236
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,010
You probably shouldn't come any closer, Yukako.

237
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,330
I can tell for myself

238
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,140
that you can't beat my Reverb Act 2's abilities.

239
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,340
You won't be able to keep me here.

240
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,590
My left eyelid is starting to twitch.

241
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,880
Ever since I was little,
my orbicularis oculi muscle would

242
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,740
start twitching when I got worked up,

243
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,120
and I'd start to feel a bit violent.

244
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,920
Don't you get up on your high horse just because

245
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,200
you've obtained a slightly different ability!

246
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,540
I'm going to have to get violent now!

247
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,200
Hot!

248
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,880
H-How dare you?!

249
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,260
My hand got burnt! You little shit!

250
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,680
When you said you were going to get violent,

251
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,140
did you mean how you're talking right now?

252
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,200
How dare you do this to me?!

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,770
You're just a baby chick!

254
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,250
You belong to me!

255
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,270
You belong to me, but you dare defy me?!

256
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,030
Even though you belong to me?!

257
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,030
Reverb Act 2!

258
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,400
I missed?

259
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,790
Hey, Josuke.

260
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,080
I heard it.

261
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,290
That was the sound of something breaking.

262
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,970
Hey, I think it's that house.

263
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,210
T-To think that her hair
would grow this much...

264
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,300
Her mental ability is too strong.

265
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,300
Mental ability that's completely
black and vindictive...

266
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,670
Was yours called Reverb?

267
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,930
Now that I know what it does,
it's not impressive at all.

268
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,210
I just need to make sure I don't
touch those letters, right?

269
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,150
By the way, I'll ask you one more time...

270
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,400
You love me, right?

271
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,880
Just try to say that you don't love me.

272
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll rip you and this house
apart right here, right now.

273
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,280
If you die, you'll be mine forever,

274
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,580
because you'll live on in my
heart as a memory forever.

275
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,090
Hurry up and answer me!

276
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,410
I'm in this mess right now because

277
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,720
you wouldn't understand when I told you.

278
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,420
I've been telling you that I don't like you

279
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,200
all this time.

280
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,060
I'll kill you, Koichi!

281
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,710
Dogon

282
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,000
I've also already told you

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,340
that you won't be able to catch me.

284
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,620
You've touched the letters
that will blow you away.

285
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,410
Those letters are on me,
the one you called a little shit.

286
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,590
Her hair turned white!

287
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,650
She's not dead, is she?

288
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,850
She's alive!

289
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,970
Even though she's crazy and downright nasty,

290
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,550
I suppose I should be happy about this.

291
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,670
I wasn't able to catch you...

292
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,170
But I figured out that all I need
to do is destroy your Stand!

293
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,030
Impudent brat!

294
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,500
Dumbass!

295
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,850
I-I can't believe you can still attack...

296
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,630
Your mental ability is insane!

297
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,010
Shut up!

298
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,140
How dare you, you little pissy-pants?!

299
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,840
How dare you do this to me?!

300
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,730
My precious hair turned white,

301
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,150
you limp-dicked bastard!

302
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,990
I loved you!

303
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,490
But I can't forgive you for
doing this to my beautiful hair!

304
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,650
I don't care who you are! I won't
forgive you if you harm my beauty!

305
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,350
I'm gonna rip off this pissy-pants' little dick
and pull out his organs along with it!

306
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,750
S-Stop...

307
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,960
Shut up!

308
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,130
You're gonna end up like
that, too, aren't you?!

309
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,100
What? What was that noise just now?

310
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,630
Let go of my Reverb and grab hold of something.

311
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,110
The cliff is going to crumble.

312
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,330
When Reverb heard the sound of your heart,

313
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,410
it also heard the sound
of the ground cracking.

314
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,570
Hah! Don't make up shit just
because you think it'll save you!

315
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,920
I have to let go of this thing
and grab on to something!

316
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,840
Damn it!

317
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I-I don't have... time!

318
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,420
Boingy-Boing

319
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,770
Boingy-Boing

320
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,270
It crumbled, just like I said, right?

321
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,010
But you don't understand
anything I say, do you?

322
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,420
You mean you had written it there already?

323
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,260
When I was trying to rip Reverb apart...

324
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,560
You put those letters on
that rock beneath the cliff?

325
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,540
You mean that while I was
trying to kill Koichi,

326
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,300
he was already trying to
think of how to save me?

327
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,400
I-I've lost completely.

328
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,570
No, I lost the moment I first saw Koichi.

329
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,680
Hey, Koichi! Are you alive?

330
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Are you all right, Koichi?!

331
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,030
Josuke! Okuyasu!

332
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,040
Took you long enough to get here! Jeez!

333
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,300
B-But I love him even more now.

334
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,260
I don't care if he completely ignores me.

335
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,470
I'm happy just thinking

336
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,310
about you, Koichi!

337
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,610
Hey, look over there! Is that Yukako?

338
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,560
Her hair's gone completely white!

339
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,060
Whoa, you're right.

340
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,060
But isn't that chick smiling like
she couldn't be any happier?

341
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,760
And she's looking right this way.

342
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,480
Huh?!

343
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,070
You're right. That's creepy as hell.

344
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,990
Let's get outta here!

345
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,800
Save me, Josuke!

346
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,570
Don't depend on me!

347
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,710
Well, I'll be damned.
Did you see that, Masaji?

348
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,860
I ain't drunk, Gramps!

349
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:11,090
Morioh Landmark 2
Cape Boingy-Boing
Directions: Ask one of the local fishermen, "Where's Cape Boingy-Boing?"
They will kindly take you there by boat.

350
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,100
Boingy-Boing Cape.

351
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,230
It seems it grew famous due to a rumor

352
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,010
that some fishermen saw a
young girl try to kill herself,

353
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,270
only for a rock in the cape to go
"boingy-boing" and gently fling her back.

354
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,350
Hirose!

355
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,060
You worked really hard on this exam.

356
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,280
You can do it if you try.

Test 3        Koichi Hirose

359
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,480
I don't...

360
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,680
know how I should feel about this.
