2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,770
I swear I'll save you,
so wait for me, Rohan!

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,830
So it learned my scent?

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,660
It's going to chase me forever,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,530
and as soon as it touches me,
it'll suck out my nutrients?

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,580
Yes!

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,080
That thing can't go faster than 60km/h!

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,150
This bike'll have no problem beating that.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,840
But how the hell am I
supposed to find the user?

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,860
I guess I'll sort out everything
I know about him first.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,870
First, why did he set up
a trap inside the tunnel?

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,060
It would have been easier to
ambush us from the roadside.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,650
Second, I think there's more
to his sucking out nutrients.

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,430
There's got to be a reason for that tunnel.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,790
I've got to check out that tunnel!

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,480
I need information about
the Futatsumori Tunnel!

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,370
Koichi!

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,280
I need to call Koichi and have
him use Reverb to find the user!

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,840
Now, now. What's the matter? There, there...

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,490
All right. There should be plenty
of distance between us now.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,800
Where's my card?

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
Y-You can't be serious!

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,060
Why'd it suddenly appear?

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,390
I ran away at 80km/h,
and it was going 60km/h.

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,060
Even doing simple math,

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,610
it should have taken another
two minutes to get here.

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,060
That thing is a Stand.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,540
It can appear and disappear freely...

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,590
He managed to make it appear
somewhere near where I am,

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,580
and now it's going to accurately

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,990
attack me by following my scent!

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,520
S-Sixty kilometers...

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,170
Wh-What?!

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,700
Shit! A baby carriage!

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,290
What's the matter with you?
You're so fussy...

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,310
If I slow down, I'm gonna die.

37
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,660
Rohan will die, as well.

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,250
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to ride through.

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,810
I have to just bust through!

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,540
But, Shining Diamond!

41
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,720
Fix.

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,330
Good!

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll never be able to make
a phone call like this!

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,690
Diamond is Unbreakable

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,690
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,710
Episode 29     Highway Go Go, Part 2

47
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,860
Listen up, Yoshioka.

48
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,260
In one minute,

49
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,930
you will receive a very
important call on your phone.

50
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,970
This is a deal worth one billion!

51
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,710
You'd better not mess this up!

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,620
I'm counting on you, Yoshioka!

53
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,070
Y-Yes, sir! Please leave it to me.

54
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,870
This is it! This cell phone!

55
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,570
It just happened to show up
at the perfect time. Lucky me!

56
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,260
I will do my absolute best!

57
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,020
Talk about a silver lining!

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,020
Hello?

59
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,850
Huh?

60
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,570
Gah! One billion yen!

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,640
Did that happen when I grabbed it?

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,460
My silver lining just broke!

63
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,170
If you hate me, just hang up on me!

64
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,620
H-How can you say that, Minayo?

65
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,390
Say it! Ask her to marry you!

66
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,970
Minayo, will you m-marry—

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,210
Man, I think I might be lucky today.

68
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,600
Huh? What? What is it, Akira?

69
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,600
Talk about good timing!

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,330
Hello, Hirose residence.

71
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,240
Koichi!

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,870
So that's what's happening.

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,250
If I don't find the user,
I'm gonna get killed.

74
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,600
I think it's a guy who has some kind of

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,550
obsession or grudge with that tunnel.

76
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,010
Are there any incidents
involving that tunnel?

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,510
Th-There is. It's in the
paper from two days ago.

78
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,540
I saw the news on TV, too.

79
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,920
Some thug on a motorcycle was driving drunk

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,080
and crashed into the tunnel's entrance.

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,650
John Doe is unconscious and in critical
condition with injuries all over his body.

82
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,320
He's undergoing intensive care
at Budogaoka Hospital now.

83
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,160
Sounds like he's a victim of the Stand, too.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,320
Anyone else?

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,220
W-Wait a sec.

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,290
When I saw the scene of the accident
on TV, there was blood all over.

87
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,540
Th-That Stand is one that
sucks up nutrients, right?

88
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,290
This sounds like a different injury.

89
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,330
Isn't it possible that the John Doe

90
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,170
who's in critical condition
could be the Stand user?

91
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,390
He needs nutrients from other
people to heal himself...

92
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,720
What? I-It's the ocean!

93
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,290
If I keep going straight, I'll be in trouble!

94
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,140
I need to turn somewhere, or I'm
gonna plunge into the ocean!

95
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,390
That corner!

96
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,010
I'll have to take it going more than 60km/h!

97
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,010
Hello? Josuke? What's wrong?

98
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,480
Koichi! Keep me on the line. Don't hang up!

99
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,810
Here I go, damn it!

100
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,530
Crap! I might crash!

101
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,530
No.

102
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,480
I can do this right now.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,520
I can make this turn.
I will make this turn, damn it!

104
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,580
Yes! I made the turn!

105
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,160
Did you see how I hung in there?! Take that!

106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,970
Wh-What?!

107
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,090
The ocean's on this side, too!

108
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,090
No Entry

109
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,350
It's Morioh Harbor!

110
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,390
Shining Diamond!

111
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,530
Now for the crumbled wall...

112
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,780
Fix it!

113
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,790
Th-That was close...

114
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,940
It was trying to head straight toward me,

115
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,260
so it couldn't see this wall.

116
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,090
Like a mosquito that can't see a screen,
it's following me by scent alone.

117
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,300
It doesn't have the ability
to think or plan its attacks.

118
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,190
Its only goal is to take nutrients from me.

119
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,580
The theory that this guy's the critically
injured patient makes sense.

120
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,990
Everything fits together.

121
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,630
Josuke!

122
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,230
Koichi, the hospital!

123
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,690
That John Doe must be the Stand user!

124
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,610
Find out his name for me.

125
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,550
Got it.

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,650
But, man, this situation is heavy...

127
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,940
H-How am I supposed to get out of this?

128
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,880
How far did he go? That little shit Josuke...

129
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,050
When this arrow wanted to
pierce a motorcycle thug

130
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,380
who was about to die after an accident,

131
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,640
I was wondering what the
hell it was thinking, but...

132
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,150
This is amazing! Just amazing!

133
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,300
Who would have thought he would
create this amazing Highway Go Go?

134
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,370
A Stand ability is all about
the user's mental strength!

135
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,420
The hungrier someone is,
the stronger they are!

136
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,360
No one can defeat the power of a man
so hungry to heal his own injuries.

137
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,260
But I really would have
loved to see Josuke die!

138
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,130
What should I do? What should I do?

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
A culvert!

140
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm glad I found a culvert
that drains into the ocean,

141
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
but it just keeps getting closer and closer.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,530
H-How am I going to get out of here?

143
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,600
Wh-Which way should I go?

144
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Um... The ocean is behind me,

145
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
which means it's also to my right.

146
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
The ocean is definitely bad news.

147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,660
The left is the way I came from... I think.

148
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,220
Wh-Which way do I go now?

149
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,630
I think the left might be the ocean,
but if I go to the right...

150
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,480
Th-There's the middle, too...

151
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,480
Wh-What's happening?

152
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,650
I'm pressing the gas, but
the speed keeps dropping...

153
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,940
I-Is it breaking down?

154
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,150
Wh-What?! It's not broken?

155
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,400
Then why am I losing speed?

156
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm gonna stop!

157
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,290
I-It's coming!

158
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,750
Could it be...

159
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,550
Am I out of gas?

160
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,560
Man, don't scare me like that.

161
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm just out of gas...

162
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,240
Then there's no problem at all.

163
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,160
I thought it was some

164
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,060
major malfunction that even
Shining Diamond couldn't fix.

165
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,560
This isn't a problem.

166
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,690
There'll be no problem escaping this.

167
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,370
Still no problem.

168
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,900
I can fix this with no problem.

169
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,790
And the motorcycle, too, of course.

170
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,220
I can't get too relaxed
since that thing teleports,

171
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,980
but gasoline is not a problem.

172
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,300
But it seems

173
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,690
that I do have a problem after all...

174
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,810
I'm lost!

175
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,680
Wh-Which way is the hospital?

176
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,310
H

177
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,380
Hi

178
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,450
Hig

179
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,520
High

180
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,590
Highw

181
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,660
Highwa

182
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:25,730
Highway

183
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:25,800
Highway G

184
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:25,870
Highway Go

185
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:25,940
Highway Go G

186
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,950
Highway Go Go

187
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,040
Budogaoka
General Hospital

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,040
Pardon me. I'm in a huge hurry.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,330
I'd like to know which room
the young man who caused

190
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,710
the motorcycle accident at
Futatsumori Tunnel is in.

191
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,150
What's his room number?

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,430
Please tell me!

193
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,440
Now, listen...

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,930
Can you not see what's written there?

195
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,870
Huh?

196
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,430
Visiting hours are over for the day

197
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,680
If you need an eye exam,

198
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,750
you can come in after 9:30 AM tomorrow.

199
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,380
Um, I'm not actually here to visit him.

200
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,560
But there's a reason I need to know his name!

201
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,360
Please, tell me!

202
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,450
Didn't you hear me tell you to go home?

203
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,770
Worthless brats like you are such a bother.

204
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,040
You seem pretty short for
a motorcycle gang member.

205
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
Do your feet even reach the ground?

206
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,700
Jeez.

207
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,970
Act 3...

208
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,220
Okay, Master! Let's kill da ho!

209
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,060
Beeetch!

210
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,480
O-Oh, no!

211
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,100
That was close...

212
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,360
These medicines costs 50,000 yen a bottle.

213
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,740
Huh?

214
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,270
They're heavy?!

215
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,260
They're going to fall!

216
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,990
Hey, you! Help me! Hold me up!

217
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,250
Um, by "Hey, you!" did you mean me?

218
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,630
Yes! Who else is here?! This is really heavy!

219
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,220
Well, yeah, but still...

220
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,880
You did just tell me to go home.

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,310
Not to mention, I'm so short,
I don't know if I can reach.

222
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,060
Are you going to get in trouble
with your boss if those break?

223
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,650
Then you're going to be like,
"Oh my gah!" Isn't it?

224
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,430
All right, fine! I'll tell you!

225
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,920
He's in room 525!

226
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,990
Yuya Fungami is in 525.

227
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,240
Take that elevator to the fifth floor!

228
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,700
Huh?

229
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,040
Josuke!

230
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,540
Koichi...

231
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,290
Did you find out where he is, Koichi?

232
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,660
Room 525! His name is Yuya Fungami!

233
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,410
It's room 525!

234
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,050
Thanks, Koichi!

235
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,080
It's on the fifth floor!
Hurry and get into the elevator!

236
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,700
Sh-Shit...

237
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,190
I-It just keeps coming in!

238
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,880
Koichi! Reverb Act 3!

239
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,040
You really are a guy I can
count on. Thanks, Koichi!

240
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,440
But 3 Freeze can only attack
one place at a time.

241
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,340
The rest of them are following Josuke!

242
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,930
There it is! Room 525!

243
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,890
I'm finally here!

244
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,560
The vent!

245
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,320
You bastard!

246
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,550
It's only a few more
meters to the room...

247
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,040
This distance is a pain!

248
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm just gonna cut through
and kick your ass!

249
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,590
Damn it!

250
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm going to get there, no matter what!

251
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm going to get there

252
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,810
and kick your ass...

253
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,520
Who the hell is that brat?

254
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,760
This is Yu's room!

255
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Don't mistake it for your own, you dumbass!

256
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,350
Don't worry about him.

257
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,300
You okay?

258
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,170
I thought it had been a while

259
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,780
since I got nutrients from that
first guy in the tunnel, but...

260
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,670
So you're the second one I've
been chasing around, huh?

261
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm surprised you really made it here.

262
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm a little shocked, actually.

263
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,210
Yu, you know this guy?

264
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,290
Huh?

265
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,060
Nah, I don't know him,
and I don't give a shit.

266
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,890
Great job, Highway Go Go.

267
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,500
I've healed up quite a bit.

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,620
If I can get nutrients from two or three
more guys with abilities like his,

269
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,820
I'll be fully recovered.

270
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,930
Hey!

271
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,730
We told you not to lay your lazy ass down there!

272
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,830
And I just told you not to worry about him!

273
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,270
More importantly, come over here
and give me some attention.

274
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,100
Little ol' me can't even move yet.

275
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,840
I really have to take a piss.
My bladder's super full.

276
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,230
Ooh! That's my job!

277
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,860
We promised we'd all take turns doing that!

278
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,590
It's my turn this time!

279
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,600
What? No, it's me!

280
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,770
I don't care who it is.

281
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,580
Just hurry up and bring the
urine bottle and help me go.

282
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay!

283
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,480
Then I'll...

284
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,020
Hey, Akemi.

285
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,130
That peach is rotten.

286
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,940
Peel a different one.

287
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,200
How can you tell it's rotten?

288
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,970
Why? Because it reeks.

289
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,940
It totally smells rotten.

290
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,460
From over there?

291
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,190
You've got a point.

292
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,460
I think my nose suddenly
got much more sensitive.

293
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,420
Oh, you're right... It really is rotten.

294
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,100
One of you three is on your period, right?

295
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,660
Am I wrong? Someone's
on her period, right?

296
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,430
Huh?

297
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,000
Ha, so it's you, Yoshie!

298
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,600
Looks like I was right.

299
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,940
And one of you is also really
pissed off right now, huh?

300
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,540
When you get mad or excited,
your body releases adrenaline,

301
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,190
and I can smell it.

302
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,700
What the hell are you mad about?
Is it you, Reiko?

303
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,010
Huh? I'm not mad.

304
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,540
We're all really happy that
you're feeling better, Yu.

305
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah, we're super happy!

306
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
There's no reason for any of us to be mad.

307
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Hey, hey, something's not right.

308
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,220
It totally reeks of someone being pissed off.

309
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,990
Don't lie to me.

310
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,990
Which one of you is mad?

311
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,730
It's me!

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,730
I'm the one who reeks of all that adrenaline!

313
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,970
Impossible!

314
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,570
You should be completely dried up by now!

315
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,490
How the hell are you standing?

316
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,490
That's because...

317
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,940
You were drinking my IV fluid?

318
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,540
It wasn't much, but I replenished myself.

319
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,260
Release Rohan, the guy you're
holding captive in the tunnel!

320
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,710
You fool!

321
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,660
Highway Go Go still remembers your scent!

322
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,480
Yu!

323
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,560
You three, don't move!

324
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,910
My name is Josuke Higashikata.

325
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,670
My Stand's name is Shining Diamond.

326
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,550
Though its target range is small,

327
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,080
it can throw punches faster than
a ho-hum speed like 60km/h.

328
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,740
I've never actually measured it,

329
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,000
but if it gets closer,
it can go about 300km/h.

330
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,960
Hey, stop! Wait!

331
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,440
M-My spine is still broken.

332
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,770
My arms and legs are still
broken and I'm bedridden.

333
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,210
I'm critically injured!

334
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,010
And you're saying that you're
going to hurt pitiful ol' me?

335
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,620
All right, my bad.
I'll free the guy in the tunnel.

336
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,250
I think he's still alive.

337
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,630
If you replenish his nutrients,
I think he'll live...

338
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,060
S-So...

339
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,750
You wouldn't do something
as cowardly as kicking

340
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,900
an injured person's ass, would you?

341
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,120
That's not something a man would do!

342
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,030
Yeah! That's cowardly!

343
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,270
Oh, I see.

344
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,310
It's true that I probably
wouldn't feel too great if

345
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,170
I kicked an injured person's ass.

346
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,730
It's definitely not manly,
and it pains my heart.

347
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,550
Right? The guilt will stick with you
forever if you kick my ass.

348
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,190
I thought about that, so I already fixed you.

349
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,050
Huh?!

350
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,810
Eh?

351
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,070
Can you move?

352
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,430
You can, right?

353
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,810
Your wounds are all healed up, aren't they?

354
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,860
Th-They are...

355
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,380
Right.

356
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,940
I figured if I fixed you up first,

357
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,200
it wouldn't be cowardly at all, would it?

358
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,960
Yuya Fungami continues his hospital stay.

359
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,620
If he ever tries to use Highway Go Go
again to try to heal himself,

360
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,220
Josuke threatens to kick
his ass over and over.

361
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,730
I feel so refreshed.

362
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,180
I feel like it's New Year's morning

363
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,380
after I just put on a fresh pair of underwear.

364
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,590
Yu!

365
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,680
However, it's rather enviable
that he gets to be nursed

366
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,870
back to health by his fangirls.

367
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,720
Meanwhile, Rohan...

368
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,950
Josuke Higashikata...

369
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,460
U-Um, look, Rohan-sensei,

370
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,930
a lot's happened, but I, uh...

371
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,930
Why did you heal me?

372
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,130
Huh?

373
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,920
You meddlesome brat.

374
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,450
I would have rather die
than be saved by you.

375
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,790
Not to mention, you stepped into the
enemy's trap after I told you to run.

376
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,890
How stupid can you be?

377
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,310
Wha—

378
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,340
Just so you know, I don't consider
this a favor I need to return.

379
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,900
...apparently still doesn't
get along with Josuke.

380
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,900
Also...

381
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,780
After all this happened,
Koichi Hirose took his dog for a walk.

382
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,270
H

383
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,340
Hi

384
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,410
Hig

385
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,480
High

386
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,550
Highw

387
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:53,620
Highwa

388
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,690
Highway

389
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:53,760
Highway G

390
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:53,830
Highway Go

391
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,900
Highway Go G

392
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,910
Highway Go Go

393
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:54,660
Yu

394
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,750
Yuya

395
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:54,870
Yuya Fun

396
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,910
Yuya Fungami

397
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,440
Ah, that cat's a British Blue.

398
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,740
Where'd you come from, little kitty?

399
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,270
