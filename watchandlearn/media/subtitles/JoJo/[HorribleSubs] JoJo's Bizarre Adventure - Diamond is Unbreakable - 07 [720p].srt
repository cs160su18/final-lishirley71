This is Morioh City Radio,
and our next segment is

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,350
"Help Me, Midnight Discussions!"

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,520
Our first letter is from
"Forever 21, Pretty Baby."

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,060
"Listen to this, Kai.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,610
I was late meeting someone
because of that thing again.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,260
Yeah, the one by the station!

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,270
The railroad crossing that
never lets you through.

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,970
Ugh, it just goes ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding... It just needs to shut up!"

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,060
Now, calm down, Pretty Baby.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,470
Oh...

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,440
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,440
Diamond is Unbreakable

14
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,140
See ya.

15
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,510
Seriously?

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,590
Episode 7  Toshikazu Hazamada (Show Off)

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,810
There are Stand users besides us at this school?

18
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,520
Yeah. He's Toshikazu Hazamada,
a student in class 3-C.

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,700
This Hazamada guy apparently got into

20
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,890
an argument over something silly with a
friend right around the start of spring.

21
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,720
One of them had insulted the other's
favorite idol or anime or something.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,500
That night, surprisingly, the friend
he got into the argument with

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,790
gouged out his own left eye
with a mechanical pencil.

24
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,170
Isn't that insane?

25
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,770
Apparently Hazamada's friend
said this at the hospital:

26
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,320
"Next thing I knew, I was staring at my left eye,
which I'd gouged out, with my right eye."

27
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,100
So you're saying that this guy gouged out

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,070
his left eye using some kind of a Stand?

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,420
Could be, but maybe not.

30
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,660
Normal people can't see Stands.

31
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,910
Something about this is really fishy.

32
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,590
What'd you say?!

33
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,610
Josuke, you've got no right to criticize me.

34
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,830
I've got a real job now, y'know!

35
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,420
Huh? You've got a job?

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,270
Yes, Master Koichi! I found myself a
little job that involves financing.

37
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,840
Financing?

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,830
You don't mean you became a loan shark, do you?

39
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,270
Well... It's a very reputable
establishment, though!

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,390
Still, though, we can't just ignore this.

41
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,500
Wait up, Josuke!

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
M-Master Koichi!

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,330
Are you going, too?

44
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,830
Just leave it to that idiot Josuke.

45
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,800
There's something scary going on in my town.

46
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,230
If Morioh City is in danger,
that means my parents, my sister,

47
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,660
and everyone else important to me
will have to face that danger.

48
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,290
So even if it's scary, I gotta do something!

49
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,970
Wh...

50
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,660
What a tough thing to say.

51
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,450
Nothing less from the man I've chosen to admire!

52
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,490
But...

53
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,550
I'll be heading home now!

54
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,640
Be safe, Master Koichi!

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,940
Yeah, totally.

56
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,900
Looks like he's not in the classroom.

57
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,630
But if that Hazamada guy really
did gouge out his friend's eye

58
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,790
and can still blend into normal school life...

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,670
He must be one creepy guy.

60
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,720
Hazamada

61
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,340
H-Hey, Josuke!

62
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm gonna check out his locker.
Watch my back, Koichi.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tell me first before you break it!

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,810
For starters... His bag is still here.

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,100
So he's still at school. Be careful.

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,320
R-Right.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,480
So he's in the tennis club and likes manga.

68
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,750
Still, this guy's got way too much stuff.

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,640
I don't think the bow and arrow
would be in here, but...

70
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,830
What's this wooden thing?

71
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,460
A Sta—

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,470
N-No... This is a physical object.

73
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,840
Is this one of those dolls they sell
at art stores for sketching?

74
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,900
It scared me...

75
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,490
Huh?!

76
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,120
What? Why?!

77
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,620
It turned into me when I touched it.

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,520
But now we know for sure...

79
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,750
Hazamada is a Stand user!

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,490
This is just great. You've got
some nerve, turning into me!

81
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,730
You've heard of Perman, right?

82
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,670
I-It talked! It sounds and talks just like him!

83
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,930
You know the copy robot from Perman?

84
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,980
Isn't that thing convenient?

85
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,150
Don't you think it'd be great to have one around?

86
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,140
Hey, Koichi. What is he talking about?

87
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,530
What the hell is Perman?

88
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,510
You haven't heard of Perman?!
I can't believe it.

89
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,160
And you call yourself Japanese?

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,250
Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions here!

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,880
M-My arm!

92
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,960
Josuke!

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,340
But mine is a copy doll that replicates
people I don't want around.

94
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,100
Once it copies you, you'll
mimic all of its movements.

95
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Which means it's not a puppet,

96
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,710
but a puppet master!

97
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,170
K-Koichi! Move!

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,140
Crunch

99
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,870
Koichi!

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,540
And one rag's been hung out to dry.

101
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,810
Oh, but I'm not the one who did it.
The one who did it was you, his friend.

102
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,940
Stuff like this

103
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,920
pisses me off more than anything.

104
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,180
When you don't do anything yourself,

105
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,960
but use others to do things for you.

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,560
That makes me want to kick
your ass like nothing else!

107
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,190
That's just great. Tee-hee!

108
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,300
Looks like you're out of range.

109
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,230
If you can't move from that spot,
your Stand can't get any closer, either.

110
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,280
Which means if I maintain this distance,

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Josuke, you stand no chance against me!

112
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,810
This Stand's name is Show Off.

113
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,250
By possessing a doll,
it has gained a physical form...

114
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,260
Which means even normal people can see it.

115
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,450
Hazamada! You bastard!

116
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,070
My goal is to beat the shit out of Jotaro Kujo

117
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,060
and run him out of this city.

118
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,490
He's got some nerve!

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,130
An outsider, coming here and
trying to dig up dirt on us...

120
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,710
But I heard that his Star Platinum
can stop time for a second or two.

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,720
There's no one in our group that
stands a chance against him.

122
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,160
That is, no one besides my Show Off,
now that it's copied you, Josuke!

123
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,270
I'll have to knock you out now.

124
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,970
The genuine article would just be in the way.

125
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,300
Squish!

126
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,400
Crushed, huh? That's a satisfying sound.

127
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,220
As long as you didn't cut the nerve,
you'll be able to see again...

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,700
If you're lucky.

129
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,640
Looks like he's gonna be out for a while.

130
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,390
That was super easy.

131
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,470
Hey! Pick up my bag.

132
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,960
We're gonna go straight after Jotaro.

133
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,470
Easy enough.

134
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm pretty sure the hotel that
Jotaro's staying at is...

135
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,840
Squish!

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,220
Squish!

137
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,920
Uh...

138
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,450
The Morioh Grand Hotel.

139
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,140
Yeah, that's the one.

140
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,490
K-Koichi!

141
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,150
Koichi!

142
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,270
J-Josuke, are you okay?

143
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,090
Th-Thanks... But man,
you've really got some guts.

144
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,360
Even though you're hurt, you managed
to use your Stand to trick him.

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,550
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,760
That's only because,

147
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,080
as soon as I got hit, you fixed my
broken bones with Shining Diamond.

148
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,430
And, uh...

149
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,370
I'd appreciate it if you could fix the
injuries I got from breaking down

150
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,930
the door and window right after that, too.

151
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
R-Right!

152
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,960
Hello, this is the Morioh Grand Hotel.

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,660
Oh, uh, could you put me through
to Jotaro Kujo in Room 324?

154
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,010
Certainly.

155
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,320
Ugh! We have to hurry up and
tell Jotaro about that Stand!

156
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,100
Thank you for waiting.

157
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,440
The line for Room 324 is currently in use.

158
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,100
Please wait until the
current call is completed.

159
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,570
The line's in use?

160
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,360
What?!

161
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,840
Of course! It must've been the copy!

162
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,620
It called him before I did!

163
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you certain, Josuke?

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,100
There's another Stand user at your school?

165
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,670
Yup! I'll tell you the details at Morioh Station.

166
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,120
Please come to the station plaza.

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,080
You should be able to get
there in fifteen minutes.

168
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,400
All right. In front of the
station in fifteen minutes.

169
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,070
Too easy.

170
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,140
I-It's no use! He's not answering.

171
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,700
He must have left the room.

172
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,650
They must have lured him out
to meet them somewhere!

173
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,820
Damn it! We're just gonna
have to go after the copy!

174
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,120
I really couldn't tell the difference
between you and the copy.

175
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,830
Yeah. What really creeped me out

176
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,750
wasn't when I saw its face.
It was the fingers.

177
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,520
You see your fingers more often
every day than your face, right?

178
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,260
I could tell that it had copied me
right down to my fingerprints.

179
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,340
Oh!

180
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,100
Josuke, you're early.

181
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,630
Where's Master Koichi?

182
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,870
H-Hazamada?!

183
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,210
What are you doing here?

184
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,540
Tamami Kobayashi?

185
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,920
You don't know why we're together?

186
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,240
N-No, I don't...

187
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,990
No idea at all?

188
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,630
No idea! Why?!

189
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,800
Then...

190
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,340
Good!

191
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,790
Hurry, please.

192
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,280
We've got to hurry and
catch up with Hazamada,

193
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
or Jotaro's gonna be in trouble!

194
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:09,600
Sh

195
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:09,810
Show

196
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,060
Show O

197
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,020
Show Off

198
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,720
Toshi

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:10,850
Toshikazu

200
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,970
Toshikazu Haza

201
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,020
Toshikazu Hazamada

202
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,100
9

203
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,180
9 Mi

204
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,270
9 Minu

205
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,350
9 Minutes

206
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,430
9 Minutes Le

207
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,520
9 Minutes Left

208
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:13,600
9 Minutes Left Un

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:13,680
9 Minutes Left Until

210
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:13,770
9 Minutes Left Until the

211
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:13,850
9 Minutes Left Until the Me

212
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:13,930
9 Minutes Left Until the Meet

213
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,980
9 Minutes Left Until the Meeting

214
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,060
There'll be trouble if Jotaro meets the copy!

215
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,380
It'll definitely be bad!

216
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,980
Yeah.

217
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,280
I don't know what we should do,
but we need to catch up!

218
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,320
Bye-bye, Josuke!

219
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,870
See you tomorrow!

220
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,020
Bye!

221
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,520
Josuke!

222
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Bye, Josuke!

223
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,540
Why the hell are you the
only one they say goodbye to?

224
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,130
I've never had anyone say that to me.

225
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,720
All the girls in this school are ugly, anyhow.

226
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,670
Josuke...

227
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,380
Hey, read this.

228
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,980
B-Bye.

229
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,440
Why the hell did you accept that?
Rip this stupid thing up!

230
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,820
Damn it... What the hell is the
difference between you and me?

231
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,800
Why does that even matter?

232
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,690
Wha...

233
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,410
You don't have any time to waste, do you?

234
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,700
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!

235
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,730
Ow!

236
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,440
You scraped your hand? That was dumb.

237
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,150
I'm made of wood, remember?

238
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,730
Shut up! Get away from me!

239
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,070
Damn it, I'm getting pissed off.

240
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,670
It's my own Stand, but this happens every time.

241
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,790
The other day, I had it copy my crush, Junko,

242
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,250
but I got pissed off because it
kept doing things to piss me off,

243
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,880
so I never even got anywhere.

244
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,030
Doesn't anyone in this world have
a decent personality? Damn it!

245
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,790
That stupid Josuke!

246
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,980
I'll hurry up and take care of Jotaro first,

247
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,160
then I'll crush him to bits!

248
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,040
I can't wait!

249
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,740
My bike!

250
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,840
It's dirty.

251
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,550
Damn it, that dumbass! I'll kill him!

252
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,430
Hey, it's not like he meant it. And he'll hear you.

253
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,390
Like I care! That's exactly why I said it.

254
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,390
Wobbling around like that...

255
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,090
Man, he looks like a dying cricket.

256
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,350
That's a good metaphor! I like it!

257
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,820
Yeah? It was a good description, huh?

258
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,870
Huh? What?

259
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,080
Hold him, Show Off.

260
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,830
I'll carve him up myself.

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Wh-What are you doing?

262
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,420
You don't have to worry about that.

263
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,290
I'm just going to make sure

264
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,850
that you'll never be able
to open your mouth again.

265
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,970
S-Stop!

266
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,680
A shard of glass?

267
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,710
J-Josuke Higashikata?!

268
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,780
Why... And the shrimp, too?

269
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,240
Hazamada!

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,670
We finally caught up with you, asshole!

271
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,420
But did you already forget?

272
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:26,170
When you come face to face with
Show Off, you become a puppet, Josuke!

273
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,130
Control him, Show Off!

274
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,380
Don't be so sure about that.

275
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,610
Wha... That shape...

276
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,020
I didn't throw that shard to hit you.

277
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,480
I threw it so I could put it
back in its original form!

278
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,330
Swoosh

279
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,940
M-My right hand!

280
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,330
It turned back into wood!

281
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,620
This isn't good, Hazamada!

282
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,820
Calm down!

283
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,030
Just pretend you have
your hand in your pocket!

284
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,330
No one will notice!

285
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,120
The real problem is

286
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,410
that Jotaro should arrive at the station soon!

287
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,750
I'm shocked that Josuke was safe,

288
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,440
but let's give up on beating him right now!

289
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,140
H-Hazamada! Wait for me!

290
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,510
I see...

291
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,890
So they're meeting him in front of the station.

292
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,260
J-Josuke, we have no time to waste!

293
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,390
The way they went is the fastest
way to get to the station!

294
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,720
And that's why I've got you, Koichi.

295
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,660
Looks like Josuke's not here yet.

296
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,410
Can you see Josuke anywhere?

297
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,960
Nope.

298
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,640
If I see any sign of him,
I'll just take control of him.

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,210
Don't worry!

300
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:59,710
Ding Ding Ding Ding

301
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,020
Hazamada! A train's coming through.

302
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,450
The railroad crossing that
never lets you through!

303
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,720
We'll have to wait a minute or two...

304
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,050
All right. We'll go through the station building.

305
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,980
No Crossing

306
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,980
Emergency
Stop
Button

307
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,510
Even if he catches up with us,
the train will stall Josuke!

308
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,770
Just one more minute!

309
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,850
I'll head over to the meeting spot first!

310
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,670
I won!

311
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,050
Huh?

312
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,200
That's Josuke!

313
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,320
Wh-What happened to the train?!

314
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,420
Why's the crossing open?!

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,000
Hazamada, look!

316
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,220
Wh-What the hell is that Stand?!

317
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,880
Ding Ding Ding Ding

318
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,490
That was great! You see?
That's why I said I've got you.

319
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,240
Ah! There he is!

320
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,740
J-Jotaro! It's me, Josuke!

321
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,140
Hey.

322
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,530
We made it in time!

323
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,770
We got Hazamada good, didn't we, Josuke?

324
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,780
Did something happen?

325
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,040
A copy?

326
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,470
A Stand that copied you
down to your fingerprints?

327
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,990
That's right!

328
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,520
There would have been trouble
if he'd gotten here before me.

329
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,990
But now we can relax.

330
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,050
That copy bastard is missing
his right hand, so it'll be easy.

331
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,930
I blew off his right hand.

332
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,690
Use that to tell us apart.

333
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,860
All right.

334
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,350
They should get here at any moment.

335
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,680
Huh? Why do I have this thing?

336
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,170
Why did I get a pen out of Jotaro's pocket?

337
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,780
I-I can't move!

338
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,720
My arm just stopped moving on its own.

339
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,200
O-On the other side of the glass...

340
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,720
Th-That's...

341
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,980
Josuke Higashikata...

342
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,900
You're gonna stab Jotaro in the head
with that pen and kill him instantly.

343
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,530
After all, if his death isn't instant,
your Shining Diamond will just fix him.

344
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,590
Josuke! This is your fault
for getting outta line!

345
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,380
I was just gonna halfway kill Jotaro
to chase him out of town.

346
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,410
But now you're the one who'll kill Jotaro!

347
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,240
It'll be all your fault!

348
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,310
Now! Let him have it, Show Off!

349
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,020
J-Jotaro...

350
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,420
You bastard!

351
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,400
Something wrong, Josuke?

352
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,220
Huh? No...

353
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,950
Looks like those guys finally found Hazamada.

354
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,100
You little shit!

355
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,780
You were just across the pedestrian bridge
at the station, just like that Josuke said.

356
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,950
He's a great guy.

357
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,330
He treated our wounds, and I'm not
even sure how, but they're all better!

358
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,260
I'll make sure I pay you back in full for earlier.

359
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,780
Let's take a little trip behind the restroom.

360
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,250
That Stand is pretty
terrifying if it catches you.

361
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,080
Well, I guess I'll break this doll now.

362
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,680
It'll make me feel better.

363
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,840
Meanwhile, unknown to anyone else,

364
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,550
Tamami was admitted to the hospital.

365
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,650
What a fool!

366
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,600
Well, you have my condolences.

367
