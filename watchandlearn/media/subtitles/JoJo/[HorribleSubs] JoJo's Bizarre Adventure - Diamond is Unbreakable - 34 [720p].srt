July 15th (Thurs)  4:43 PM

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,650
It's open. Come in.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,150
Rohan-sensei?

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,110
Where...

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,820
Over here, Koichi.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,880
Rohan-sensei!

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,320
What's wrong? You wouldn't explain
anything over the phone...

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,130
I'd like you to help me.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,490
I'm being attacked by an enemy Stand.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,300
What?!

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,530
A S-Stand? Where is it? Where?!

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,070
It's on my back. It's possessed my back.

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,420
Your back?

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,420
Um... Your back is being attacked?

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,290
Yes. It's a very dangerous Stand.
I'm not sure what I should do.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,190
Could you show it to me?

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,100
I cannot.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,380
But if you don't show it to me...

20
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,290
If I show it to you, it'll kill
me and transfer over to you!

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,690
Hurry up and burn them, okay?

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,650
See? It's talking! It's this thing, Koichi!

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,160
Huh?

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,160
Why are you hiding it?!

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,580
Did you call me over here
just to mess with me?

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,790
What are you talking about?!

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,420
I already told you. If I
show you my back, I'll die!

28
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,420
But you're always messing with me, Sensei.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,190
So that is what's going on.

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,410
No! I'm being serious right now!

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,020
There's a corpse upstairs!

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,110
Huh? A c-corpse?!

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,080
Um... What are you doing, Sensei?

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
Climb over me, and go ahead.

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,980
Please, please, go ahead. Please!

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,560
Seriously, what's with you?

37
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,280
Well? Do you believe me now?

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,510
It's gone!

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,510
That's impossible...

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,880
Right here, Koichi!

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,260
Look, Koichi! This is Masazo Kinoto!

42
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,800
He had the life sucked out
of him, and he dried up!

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
Wow, that's amazing. You did
a great job making that.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,120
But this is no time to be
joking around, Sensei!

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,060
The Stand users made by the old man
in the picture are really after us.

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,290
So I rushed over here, thinking that
something might've happened to you, too!

47
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,110
What?

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,780
Then this thing...

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,930
Anyway, just be careful.

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,130
Bye.

51
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,000
W-Wait, Koichi!

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,860
I asked you to come because
I knew those shitbags

53
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,460
Josuke and Okuyasu wouldn't believe me!

54
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,860
You have to believe me!
We're friends, aren't we?!

55
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,400
Koichi!

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,300
Don't be down, okay?
Even though this has gotta hurt...

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,160
I, Rohan Kishibe, have never
faced such humiliation...

58
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,500
You bastard. You'll regret this...

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,690
Diamond is Unbreakable

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,690
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

61
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,350
July 15th (Thurs)  5:25 PM

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Lately, my nails are growing fast again.

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,940
Episode 34    July 15th (Thurs), Part 4

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Too fast.

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,940
That woman running her fingers through
her prized, well-cared-for hair...

66
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,200
Congratulations. You get to live longer.
I'll hold off on picking you right now.

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,810
Until I can completely blend into
Kosaku Kawajiri's lifestyle.

68
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,330
So, every time I leave,

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,290
my dad, like, totally follows me in
secret, or comes snooping around.

70
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,710
You're going out at night too much.

71
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,580
And whose fault is that?

72
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,020
I got super pissed off, so I totally stole
something in front of him on purpose.

73
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,160
And then I went straight to your place.

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,110
Seriously? They've probably got
the cops looking for you now.

75
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,100
Hey... What are you touching my bag for?

76
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,700
What's wrong?

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,890
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

78
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,790
What are you, a pickpocket?
A groper? What a joke.

79
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,000
Morioh. Morioh.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,020
Oh, crap! This is Morioh.

81
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,170
Come on, we're getting off.

82
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,970
Ow...

83
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,480
What the hell?

84
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,740
Watch where you're going
when you get off the train!

85
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,050
Hey, did you see that? He had
a bowling pin nail clipper.

86
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,440
A bowling pin nail clipper, in this
day and age... What a geek.

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
July 15th (Thurs)  5:07 PM

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,360
Do you have the pictures?

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,070
Hey, where are you going with the pictures?

90
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,400
Morioh Grand Hotel.
That's the only place I can go now.

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,620
To where Jotaro is? It doesn't
matter where you go, okay?

92
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,300
Just give up and burn the pictures.

93
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,380
Well done...

94
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,130
Even though you don't know who could
be watching from which window.

95
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,650
This is dangerous.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,410
There, you see? Every street has an intersection.

97
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,960
See? There's no way you can cross.

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,780
Someone will see your back for sure.

99
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,410
The road's just going to get wider,
and there will be even more people.

100
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,590
So let's just not go! Okay?

101
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,120
There's no way you can cross.

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,530
You think so?

103
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,600
Masazo Kinoto came all the way to my house.

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,310
He must have crossed an intersection, as well.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,340
I just have to figure out how he crossed it.

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,950
And he did it... like this!

107
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,960
Stick

108
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,170
This is ridiculously embarrassing,
but I can make it to the station this way.

109
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,620
Yeah, not bad, Rohan Kishibe.

110
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,570
But you've forgotten something.

111
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,650
When Masazo Kinoto was crossing,
I didn't interfere with him!

112
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,580
Hey, jackass! Why are you walking so slow?

113
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,020
The hell did you say?!

114
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,900
See?

115
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,520
Er, hey! Turn around!

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,910
What?!

117
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,240
You're the one forgetting
something, Cheap Trap.

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,450
Masazo Kinoto didn't have this...

119
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,460
He didn't have Heaven's Door!

120
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,980
Cannot turn around
for one minute.

121
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,640
What?!

122
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,560
All right. Now I should have no problem
walking so that no one sees my back.

123
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,140
You'd better be prepared, you bastard.

124
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,180
Wh-What?

125
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,970
There's no way you're going to make it.

126
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,240
You're the one who's going to die
with your dick all shriveled up.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,150
Just keep running your mouth.

128
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,950
Your only ability is to talk.
And that's been sealed.

129
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,490
Wh-Wh-Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

130
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,200
July 15th (Thurs)  5:32 PM

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,150
Looks like there aren't any
big intersections for a while.

132
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Hey, can you use your Heaven's
Door ability on animals, too?

133
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,210
Yeah, if the animal has any intelligence.

134
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,650
So that means if an animal sees your
back, I can transfer over to them, too!

135
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,860
Even easier than humans, huh?

136
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,850
True. I have to be careful of these guys, too.

137
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,810
I hate cats.

138
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,910
They glare at you.

139
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,570
Hey, move!

140
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,150
What?! It can't be...

141
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,750
So one of these guys just has
to glance at your back, right?

142
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,970
My ability is only to speak.

143
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,500
But, you see, humans aren't the
only ones that I can talk to.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm the one who called them here.

145
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,600
They hate you.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,620
I just told them that you
love killing cats and dogs!

147
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,060
Get him!

148
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,030
Heaven's Door!

149
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,480
I-It's no use! There are too many!

150
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,550
I won!

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,980
3 Freeze!

152
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,130
These animals didn't do anything wrong.

153
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,580
So scram, all of you. Shoo.

154
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,550
Th-That Stand is...

155
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,430
Koichi!

156
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,690
What?!

157
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,400
I thought that you might
just be messing with me,

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,830
but I was still a bit worried, so I went back,

159
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,330
and you were still acting
weird, Rohan-sensei.

160
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,720
Even outside your house, you were
walking with your back to walls,

161
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,600
and crossing the street with your
back to someone else's, all by yourself.

162
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,460
So you really do have an
enemy Stand on your back.

163
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,350
That's exactly what I admire
so much about you...

164
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,810
You truly are my friend.

165
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,580
It's on your back, right?

166
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,830
I just have to remove the
enemy from your back, right?

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,910
Reverb, 3 Freeze!

168
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,560
Heavy...

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,370
Y-You did it!

170
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,020
Aren't you a bit naïve?

171
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,450
I'm not sticking to your back with
strength, but with my ability.

172
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,530
Trying to forcibly remove me from your back

173
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,240
means that you'll destroy your back.

174
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,810
Thud

175
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,320
Huh?!

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,330
Go ahead and tell Koichi, okay?
Hurry up and tell him!

177
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,320
R-Rohan-sensei?!

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,980
K-Koichi...

179
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,820
I'm very moved that you came
here, and very grateful...

180
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,410
But I'd appreciate it if you'd withdraw Act 3.

181
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,950
You can't see it, but my back is
starting to rip ever so slightly...

182
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,870
Act 3! Undo the 3 Freeze!

183
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,510
S-h-i-t. Understood.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,590
R-Rohan-sensei! A-Are...

185
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,500
Of course I'm not okay, Koichi Hirose!

186
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,350
This damage is your fault, isn't it?

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
Do you get it now?
There's no way to get rid of me.

188
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,670
Peeling me off your back, Rohan,

189
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,200
means that you'll be peeling
away your own back!

190
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,970
Hey...

191
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
You're just going to wear yourself out.

192
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,460
Either you'll pass out from
exhaustion and damage first,

193
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,970
or you'll go crazy and kill yourself...

194
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,540
No matter how great the Stand,

195
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,410
they can't defeat me
if my only ability is to talk!

196
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,470
Okay?

197
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,720
The Stand on your back... Just what kind of...

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,480
Large Vehicles
Cannot Pass
Through

199
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,920
What kind? Do you want to see?

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,610
You want to see what kind of Stand it is?

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,210
Fine...

202
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,480
I'll show it to you.

203
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,510
R-Rohan-sensei...

204
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,050
Looks like you've finally lost it!

205
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,380
I guess you finally realized it's
no use going to Jotaro, either!

206
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,230
Jotaro?

207
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,580
I wasn't heading there in the first place.

208
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,570
I was heading here.

209
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,530
I was so happy to finally make it here

210
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,380
that I couldn't help but laugh.

211
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,040
What are you yammering about?

212
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,650
You finally showed your back to someone!

213
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,530
I'm now going to possess Koichi Hirose!

214
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,910
Th-This place... That post box...

215
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,820
Cheap Trap, you turned around here.

216
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,590
Even if you didn't turn around because
you knew what this place was,

217
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:56,090
because of your ability, you had no
choice but to look Koichi's way.

218
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,490
Wh-What?!

219
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,490
The alley where Reimi is, where you
can't turn around, no matter what!

220
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,330
It's true that if any Stand tried to get
rid of you, no matter what it was,

221
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,560
you'd return the damage to me.

222
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,710
But there was something that
could grasp only you...

223
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,870
Something that'll only take
those who look back.

224
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,900
Something that'll only take your soul!

225
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,910
Let go! Okay? Let go!

226
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,860
Where do you think you're taking me?! Hey!

227
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,540
The afterlife.

228
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,050
I don't know if Heaven or Hell actually exist,

229
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,070
but just in case, I'll write it in for you.

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,300
Going to Hell

231
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,730
It wouldn't do anything except talk,
but that was one intense Stand.

232
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,980
Koichi, if you hadn't come,

233
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,810
I wouldn't have made it here,
and it would have killed me.

234
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,010
But since I was so focused on that thing,

235
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,710
I had no idea we'd end up here.

236
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,780
Reimi!

237
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Did you take these pictures, Rohan?

238
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,350
I did.

239
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,840
Something bothers me about them...

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,920
Hayato Kawajiri

241
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,920
Kosaku Kawajiri
Family of 3

242
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,300
C

243
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,390
Ch

244
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,480
Che

245
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,570
Chea

246
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:20,660
Cheap

247
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:20,750
Cheap T

248
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:20,840
Cheap Tr

249
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:20,930
Cheap Tra

250
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,920
Cheap Trap

251
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:21,710
Masa

252
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:21,880
Masazo

253
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,920
Masazo Kinoto

254
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,090
July 15th (Thurs)  6:04 PM

255
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,800
So, like, Mika

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,700
got her boyfriend to buy her
some expensive brand earrings.

257
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,670
Buy some for me, too!

258
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,160
Next time.

259
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,750
What do you think you're
doing in my apartment?!

260
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,110
Hey, get the hell out!

261
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,130
Hm... A one-room apartment...

262
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,710
I am Yoshikage Kira. Would you be
kind enough to tell me your name?

263
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,710
My nails are quite long, aren't they?

264
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,230
Look how long they are.

265
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,270
Is there anyone who can actually
stop their nails from growing?

266
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,700
There isn't.

267
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,990
Just as no one can stop
their nails from growing,

268
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,270
you cannot stop the destiny
you were born with.

269
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,630
I believe I asked for your name...

270
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,570
M-My boyfriend... What did you do to my—

271
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,930
Don't answer a question with a question!

272
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,800
Didn't they teach you in school not to
answer a question with a question?!

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,010
I'm asking you what your name is!

274
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,630
M-Minako! M-M-Minako!

275
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,710
Minako...

276
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,420
Your parents gave you a beautiful name.

277
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,630
I like it.

278
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,380
Minako, I have a request.

279
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,520
It would make me happy
if you would hold these.

280
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,020
I want you to cut my nails with
these geeky nail clippers.

281
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,400
You've never cut someone else's nails?

282
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,790
There's a first time for everything.

283
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,750
Be careful not to cut them too short.

284
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,630
Help... Please...

285
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,290
Help... Forgive me...

286
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,280
Forgive you?

287
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,190
Now, wait a minute.

288
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm not angry or anything.

289
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,050
This is something I enjoy.

290
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,900
I chose you because you
suited my taste, as well.

291
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,580
I was born with these tastes, so I'm just
trying to act positively about it.

292
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,190
Positively...

293
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,670
It sounded like you were asking
your boyfriend for some earrings.

294
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,950
Here, he left these for you.

295
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,710
It's a present.

296
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,120
You're very good at cutting nails.
I like that about you, too.

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,210
And you are truly adorable
when you don't talk.

298
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,330
What to do, Minako...

299
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,630
I want to take you home with me,

300
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,120
but bringing you into the
Kawajiri home would be risky.

301
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,080
Still, this is refreshing...
This is truly refreshing!

302
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,890
Th-The man and woman he
followed from the station...

303
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,320
He killed them and made them disappear!

304
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,460
That's... Hayato.

305
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,370
What is he doing in a place like this?

306
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,040
This is the opposite direction
from the house and his school...

307
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,970
What's that?

308
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,140
I didn't lock the door...

309
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,430
Hayato... He...

310
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,290
It couldn't be.

311
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,700
He's not human... What is that
thing that's disguised as my dad?

312
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,880
There's evidence that they've been back here.

313
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,060
And there are blood stains on the floor.

314
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,790
Did he finally make his move?

315
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,650
July 15th (Thurs)  8:36 PM

316
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,480
The thing in Hayato's hand
was definitely a handy cam.

317
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,740
It doesn't seem to be in
this room right now...

318
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,740
Hayato...

319
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,480
He's been acting weird
ever since the other day.

320
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,870
I have to find out what Hayato was doing.

321
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,390
I have to find out for sure.

322
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,510
C-Calm down...

323
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,770
I have to calm down and gather my thoughts.

324
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,610
First, this videotape...

325
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,770
Should I show it to someone?

326
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,760
I can't show it to Mom!

327
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,280
Mom totally trusts him.

328
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,450
Should I show it to the police?

329
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,010
Would they believe that a person got
blown up and then disappeared?

330
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,630
More importantly, he's not human...

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,040
Could the police even
catch someone like him?

332
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,580
No... Does anyone even exist in
this world who could catch him?

333
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,680
What should I do?

334
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,470
Mom and I are going to be killed eventually.

335
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,010
What am I supposed to do?!

336
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,520
Do you mind if I join you...

337
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,850
in the bath, Hayato?

338
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,140
It's been a while.

339
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,650
I-I'm gonna head out now.

340
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,180
Oh, come on.

341
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,660
We're family, after all...

342
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,950
Wh-What does he want?

343
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,250
I'll be in trouble if he finds this tape.

344
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm sorry, Hayato, but could
you let go of the bucket?

345
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,590
I want to draw some water and wash my body.

346
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,210
I-I'll wash your back for you, Dad!

347
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,910
That's a great idea.

348
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,230
But I'll wash your back first.

349
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,000
You're the one who got in first.
I'll wash yours first, then we can switch.

350
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,560
Now, sit down.

351
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,110
What's the matter?
You seem to be sweating quite a bit.

352
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,120
Did you get get too hot?

353
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,930
Y-Yeah...

354
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,180
Then why are you shivering?

355
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,250
Isn't it strange to shiver if you're overheated?

356
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,940
You're tickling me, Dad!

357
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,160
You should know that I've
always been ticklish!

358
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,960
You're... right.

359
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,930
You've always been ticklish, Hayato.

360
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,590
I-I'll wash my front...

361
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,700
I see. So you'll do it yourself.

362
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,160
By the way, I just remembered...

363
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,450
This evening,

364
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,000
I was around the Jozenji area that's
in the opposite direction from home,

365
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
and I saw you.

366
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,390
Huh?!

367
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,890
With a video camera!

368
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,040
What were you doing?

369
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,390
Now I know for sure!

370
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,140
This little brat was watching!

371
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,680
This is awful... I thought I'd
peacefully fit into this household...

372
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,900
I've had nothing but misfortune this year.

373
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,760
What an awful year.

374
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,280
Killing this brat will draw attention
to myself, and that would be very bad.

375
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,820
But since he saw that, I have no choice!

376
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,870
I just turned one of the strands
of this brat's hair into a bomb.

377
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,790
If I just cause a slight explosion on his head,

378
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,090
it'll just look like he slipped
and hit his head on the bath.

379
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,090
That's a common accident in our society.

380
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,300
You're going to die.

381
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,840
Die, brat!

382
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,710
Are you going to kill me, too?

383
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,420
Even though I've got video of you...

384
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm even videotaping you right now!

385
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,690
What?

386
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,480
I've been suspicious of you this whole time.

387
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,520
Your different shoe size

388
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,230
and the fact that you were practicing
your signature are all on tape!

389
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,100
I've got other tapes, too!

390
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,620
I even took a video of the cat-like
plant you've got in the attic!

391
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,080
I'm the only one who knows
where the tapes are!

392
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,580
But if something were to happen to me,
I'm sure someone would find that place.

393
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,210
What?

394
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,080
Don't you dare lay a finger on me! Got it?

395
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,210
You little shit! You dare threaten me?

396
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,680
I won't let you touch my mom, either!

397
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,310
