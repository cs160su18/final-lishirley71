2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,320
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,110
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,780
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,780
They are trying to break out!

53
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,540
He is pursuing his brother
who has been taken away!

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,250
And he is chasing them!

55
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,170
This unprecedented jailbreak
taking place in hell itself...

56
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,670
...continues to unfold under the sea!

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,260
Ace's public execution is in...

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,050
...4 and a half hours!

59
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,310
New Kama Kempo: 44--Aesthetic Technique!

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Hair Removal Fist!

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,820
The 4 demon guards all
together after all this time!

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,200
B-B-B-B-Boss!

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,240
--S-S-Straw Hat?!
--T-That's the Warlord--Jimbei!

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,580
Hydra!

65
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,920
"Magellan's Tricky Move!
A Foiled Escape Plan!"

66
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,810
After that king of the pervs and his crony,

67
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,560
it's your turn now!

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Magellan...

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,190
No way! Ivan-san and Inazuma got...

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,450
Crab-chan!

71
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,370
Ivan-chan!

72
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,290
Damn you!

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,830
No, Straw-chan!

74
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,520
Running is the only option
we have with Magellan!

75
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,550
Let me go, Bon-chan! I got to kick his butt!

76
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,300
Are you sure?!

77
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,600
--I understand--but you really want us to...
--Yes.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,440
--Set it all up as I said quick!
--Yes, sir!

79
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,280
Alright! We have orders from Warden
Magellan! Get backup security to help us!

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Yes, sir!

81
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,030
Dammit! So that's what he's planning?!

82
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,540
Don't forget that you
nearly died fighting him!

83
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,250
But I'm alive now!

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,050
Miracles don't come often, that's
why they are called miracles!

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,140
Both of you, let's get to the upper level!

86
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,890
Luffy-kun!

87
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,230
Get to the main entrance quickly!

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,550
It's not looking good!

89
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,320
We were paying
too much attention to Magellan!

90
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,990
Okay, I got it!

91
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,160
--We're gonna proceed with the plan now!
--Clank!

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,910
Everybody, get ready! Get to your positions!

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,080
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,050
Those of you with guns,
shoot to stop Magellan!

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,090
Dammit!

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,800
You better go now, Straw-chan!

97
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,120
That's not enough to stop him!

98
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,730
Oh no! He's coming!

99
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,860
Hurry up, Luffy-kun!

100
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,530
Hydra!

101
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,110
Heads up, everybody!

102
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,390
Candle Wall!

103
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,390
San!

104
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,770
He stopped Magellan's Hydra!

105
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,610
Your naiveness sickens me!

106
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,410
Don't think me letting my guard down
means I want to be your friend!

107
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,410
Stupid!

108
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,580
I just don't want to owe you any more favors!

109
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,960
I admire you even more, brother 3!

110
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,880
I see. You use wax!

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,260
That's right! I ate the Wax-Wax
Fruit and became the wax man!

112
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,300
This wall is as tough as iron!
It won't let your venom through!

113
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,770
That pile of garbage found his use.

114
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,310
You never know what powers may come in handy.

115
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,400
You better go now! I don't
intend to do this forever!

116
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,490
San!

117
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,080
How annoying!

118
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,660
Don't just stand there! It
won't hold out that long!

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,120
Okay, I'm gonna go!

120
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,290
Let's go, you guys!

121
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,300
--You've got quite a power!
--It works well if it's not the fiery floor!

122
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,800
Keep going, you guys! I wanna
follow right behind you!

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,890
Luffy-kun, we have to go now!

124
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,930
Didn't you say we need to steal a Navy ship?

125
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,140
Yes.

126
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,770
Then, why don't you go ahead with
everyone else? I'll try to stop him!

127
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,570
It'll be hard to steal it
with him chasing us anyway.

128
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,490
That's true but...

129
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,240
I have an idea!

130
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,490
Do you think it's gonna work?

131
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,830
Yeah! You can count on me!

132
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,660
Alright! But don't push it too far!

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,130
Okay, San! Let's fight him!

134
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,550
No no! I wasn't gonna fight! I
was doing it so we can run...

135
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,090
Brother 3! We aren't so
strong but let us help you!

136
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,300
Like I said, I wasn't gonna go that far...

137
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,760
Hey, can you do me a favor?

138
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,520
Listen to me!

139
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,150
Here comes Hydra again!

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,150
--Can you do that?
--Yes, that's possible.

141
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,530
--Okay, I'm counting on you!
--All right!

142
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,830
Wax-Wax Candle Armor!

143
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,730
Alright! With these on, I'm...

144
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,070
...so cool!

145
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,600
It's perfect!

146
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,330
Face forward! What're you
saying at a time like this?!

147
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,950
Don't know why... but tears
keep filling my eyes...

148
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,080
Thank you for making me this cool!

149
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,580
Shut up and just fight!

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,960
Straw Hat, I admire you
just for your tenacity!

151
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,180
What did you do to Ivan-chan?!

152
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,370
You're talking about Ivankov?

153
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,520
Of course, I executed him!

154
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,350
Don't worry! You will soon follow!

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I-It's coming!

156
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,900
Hydra!

157
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,610
--San!
--All right!

158
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,300
Candle Wall!

159
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,040
It's not gonna work no matter
how many times you try!

160
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,090
Gum-Gum...

161
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,930
...Champion...

162
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,010
...Rifle!

163
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,730
Yes! I can touch him!

164
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,150
--We found cannons!
--With candle shields!

165
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,320
Yeah! We got him!

166
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,570
We can beat him!

167
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,290
Alright!

168
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,750
Listen! We gotta buy some time here!

169
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,760
Here they come! Shoot!

170
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,390
Don't hesitate! You guys, break away!

171
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,230
We're close! Keep going up!

172
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,310
--Almost there!
--We can get out!

173
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,370
It didn't work?!

174
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,500
Magellan is unbeatable! Let's go all the way!

175
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,460
What?!

176
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,940
There are no more formidable enemies here!

177
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,860
You're letting your guard
down. What are you an amateur?

178
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,900
What?!

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,820
There are at least 10 Navy ships out there.

180
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,620
And each one has 800 marines on board.

181
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,490
I don't know their configuration but...

182
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,330
...stealing a Navy ship means that we
will have to face the remaining ships.

183
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,340
Can you still be relaxed?

184
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,800
Y-You've got a point.

185
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,090
That's not the only problem we have!

186
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,050
There's no more guards here!
All that is left is this door!

187
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,520
Finally!

188
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,190
I've never forgotten the
entrance of Impel Down!

189
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,110
We all came through here
and entered into hell!

190
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,320
It's been how many years?

191
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,500
Are we really here?! I
still can't believe it!

192
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,290
I never thought that I'd break out like this.

193
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,550
Alright! Everybody, train your
weapons! Let's open the door!

194
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,180
Ready? Here we go!

195
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,190
I'm gonna get out finally!

196
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,520
You fool! This doesn't mean
that we've succeeded yet!

197
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,700
The Navy is waiting for us out there
and we don't know if we can make it!

198
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,160
You're right.

199
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,830
Now that you put
it that way I agree with you.

200
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,790
Yeah. But we can't stop
after coming this far.

201
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,040
We should just go as far as we can!

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,560
--It's sunlight!
--I'm free!

203
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,690
Everybody, get ready!

204
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,780
Even if thousands of marines
are waiting for us,

205
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,320
we're gonna break through
and go back to the sea!

206
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,000
Alright! Let's go, you guys!

207
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,400
Alright! Let's go, you guys!

208
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,030
Follow me!

209
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,750
What is going on here?!

210
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,000
There's no Navy ship at all!

211
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,610
Not even a single ship to steal!

212
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,470
Not even a single marine!

213
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,770
No way! Then...

214
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,440
...we can't do anything!

215
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,130
What should we do?!

216
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,700
All we can do is just wait for
Magellan to come and kill us here?!

217
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,120
Dammit! You gotta be kidding!

218
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,130
I see. They're not as stupid as I thought.

219
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,130
There are large Sea Kings in the water.

220
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,010
As is said, the Calm Belt is the
greatest barrier protecting Impel Down.

221
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,910
We barely made it this far
from the bottom of hell!

222
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,640
Damn! We'll be dragged back to hell!

223
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,650
We don't have time to complain!

224
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,900
They cleared out because Magellan
told them to do so--but not long ago!

225
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,400
Take a good look!

226
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,450
You can see shadows of
sails slightly in the fog!

227
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,870
Oh yeah, he's right!

228
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,330
But it's too far! We still can't reach them!

229
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,750
Yeah, it's too late for us to...

230
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,500
Don't worry!

231
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,220
You have me here! Let me handle this!

232
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,690
Holy cow!

233
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,190
How strong!

234
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,830
He's carrying the gigantic door by himself?!

235
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,870
I can't carry that many

236
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,250
but let's sail out with this
to take one of those ships!

237
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,630
Those of you who are determined, get on!

238
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,590
Is it possible to steal a ship with that?

239
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,720
C-Crocodile!

240
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
That's it? Alright then...

241
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,770
Wait a minute!

242
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,310
Aren't you forgetting about me?

243
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,980
I know you need me so I'm coming with you!

244
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,220
--You have a lot of guts!
--That's our Captain Buggy!

245
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,990
Take this Baby Transponder
Snail I found just in case!

246
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,160
Hey, can we just go now?

247
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,080
Alright! Let's do it!

248
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,540
You all ready? We got to hurry!

249
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,260
He's swimming with that
heavy door on his back!

250
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,930
Only the captain of the Fish-Man
Pirates could do that!

251
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,500
I can't wait to see how
the Warlord's gonna fight!

252
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,400
And our savior Captain Buggy is with him!

253
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,110
It's looking hopeful!

254
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,990
How stupid they are! It's much
safer to be with a Warlord...

255
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,540
...rather than staying there and
being scared of Magellan, fools!

256
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,540
They're shooting at us!

257
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,130
They found us.

258
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,490
He avoided it! He's so fast!

259
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,890
He's not just a Fish-Man! He's the
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

260
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,390
All forces! Open fire!

261
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,140
If we can sink Jimbei, they are finished!

262
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,850
There they are! Crowds of Navy ships!

263
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,830
I'm going to launch you
onto the deck! Hold tight!

264
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,410
Huh? W-What?! What did
you just say, fish face?!

265
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,590
Oh? That bastard's gone!

266
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,170
Ugh! What's going on here?!

267
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,590
I know! He left us here
and got away by himself!

268
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,220
Traitor, traitor, traitor...

269
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,840
Why did you come with us?

270
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,440
Jimbei! Where's that bastard gone?!

271
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,490
We're gonna get hit!

272
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,650
Can't you just be quiet?

273
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,280
Fish-Man Jiu-Jitsu!

274
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Water Heart!

275
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,380
It's coming towards us!

276
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,770
Ocean Current...

277
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,520
...Shoulder Throw!

278
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,950
We're flying!

279
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,500
What's that water column?!
It looks like a living thing!

280
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,370
Do you have any idea of what it is?

281
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,000
No, I don't.

282
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,050
But I can see people on it! One is Crocodile!

283
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,220
It's coming!

284
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,860
They're trying to hijack the
ship! Stop them at any cost!

285
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,730
We can just throw those Devil
Fruit eaters off into the water!

286
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,960
You didn't learn anything
after I beat you so soundly?!

287
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,990
I forgot it all!

288
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,300
Gum-Gum...

289
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,470
...Champion...

290
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,800
...Bazooka!

291
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,200
Then this time, I'll make sure
that you'll never forget...

292
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,910
...by burying you with it!

293
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,110
To buy Jimbei the timed needed to steal a ship,

294
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,180
Luffy makes a stand against Magellan.

295
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,010
Magellan, now at bay,

296
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,810
unleashes his strongest technique, capable of destroying Impel Down itself.

297
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,610
"The Escapee Team in Trouble! The
Forbidden Move: Venom Demon!"

299
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
