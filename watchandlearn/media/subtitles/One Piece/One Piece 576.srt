00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,460
The Straw Hats have left the

69
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,940
Fish-Man Island and finally
reached the New World.

70
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,490
But not before entering the
treacherous Maubeugemour Sea.

71
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,280
Arriving there, they met a Giant
girl who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit.

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,700
My name is Lily Enstomach.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
People call me "Lily the Glutton"!

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,910
I eat a lot for a woman, right?

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,920
The ship carrying Dad will pass through here!

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,670
You mean the Navy is coming?!

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,920
If they see us, it's not gonna be pretty!

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah. But I have to save Dad at any cost!

79
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,730
Before they take him to Impel Down,

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,560
this is my last chance to save him!

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,860
Lily.

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,610
Let me help you!

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,030
I wanna try that heavenly food
that only your dad can make!

84
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,370
They decided to help Lily save her father

85
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,970
- Panz Fry from the Navy's ship. However...

86
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,460
...a mysterious group called the
Neo Navy is trying to kill him.

87
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,470
I heard a ship carrying Panz
Fry, that big-shot pirate,

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,500
will pass through the Maubeugemour Sea soon.

89
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,010
It's the Navy!

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,930
--Dad!
--Is that him?

91
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:26,910
"Z's Ambition! A Dark and Powerful Army!"

92
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,590
SIN

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,580
They deployed 4 ships just
to transport a pirate?

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,060
I guess Lily's dad is really a big-shot.

95
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,050
Dad...

96
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,410
Is that the only reason?

97
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,450
That security is a strange choice

98
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,730
but I wonder why they chose to pass through

99
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,220
this dangerous area on
their way to Impel Down.

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,910
Alright! Let's raid them already!

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,920
No way! Don't be ridiculous!

102
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,840
Listen. Our priority is
to save Lily's father!

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,640
If we make a raid without
any plan, he could get hurt!

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,590
She's right, Luffy!

105
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,690
If anything happens to her father,

106
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,180
we wouldn't be able to eat
that heavenly volcano food!

107
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,730
Then what should we do?

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,660
Can I take charge of this operation?

109
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,620
What do you say?

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,570
Yes, I want you to do it, Nami-sa!

111
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,700
Uh-huh, all right!

112
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,880
First, we need a diversion team.

113
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,790
You take the Mini-Merry and divert
their attention from a distance...

114
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,060
...to set up the infiltration team.

115
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,680
The members of the team are
Chopper as boat operator,

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,260
Luffy, Robin, and Brook.

117
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,550
A diversion?  That means
I can kick their asses?!

118
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,840
No, you can't!

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,610
Robin and Brook will create a diversion!

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,220
You just have to wait in case
something really goes wrong!

121
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,440
Don't do anything before!

122
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,280
Now, the infiltration team.

123
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,560
You take the Shark Submerge and sneak

124
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,960
onto the raft without being
seen by the Navy soldiers.

125
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,830
Then cut the chain and release Lily's father.

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,760
The members are Zoro, Sanji-kun...

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,130
Count on me!

128
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,440
...Usopp, and Lily - can you do it?

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,090
Uh-huh!

130
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,050
That sounds like more fun.

131
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,510
All right?

132
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,890
The point is how to bring
such a giant man back safely.

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,330
You're right. It'll draw their
attention since he's so big.

134
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,660
It'd be nice if we could
steal one of their ships

135
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,820
but it'd take too much time and energy.

136
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,250
So what we're gonna do instead is detach

137
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,460
the raft from the ship and whisk
it away with Coup de Burst.

138
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,610
Franky, you stay on the Sunny and
wait somewhere they can't see you.

139
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,870
Prepare for Coup de Burst.

140
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,330
I got it!

141
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,370
What about you, Nami?

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,650
Me? I'll spy on their movements
with the White Hobby Horse

143
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,420
and take command of this mission.

144
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,010
Don't forget that we're
in the Maubeugemour Sea.

145
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,530
Watch out for a sudden change in weather.

146
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,720
Now let's do it!

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,010
Okay!

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,940
Come to think of it, we are all
Devil Fruit eaters in this team.

149
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,640
You're right.

150
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,320
So if we fall into the sea,
we're pretty much finished.

151
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,570
What?!

152
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,110
I hope we don't drown
and get eaten by sharks.

153
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,120
No! You're making us scared, Robin!

154
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,230
Since we're deploying on the open sea,

155
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,320
I placed all Devil Fruit
eaters except for Lily

156
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,250
in the diversion team to be safe.

157
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,490
See you!

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,730
Where is Luffy?

159
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,220
I told him to get on board the Mini-Merry!

160
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,770
He took the Shark Submerge
instead and left earlier.

161
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,460
What?

162
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,980
Well, he came with us saying that
the diversion sounded boring.

163
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,910
Lily, I can't wait to see your dad!

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Uh-huh!

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,740
How selfish!

166
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,330
Hey, Luffy, are you listening?!

167
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,270
Don't you dare sneak onto the raft!

168
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,030
It will screw up the whole plan!

169
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,150
Alright!

170
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,090
By the way, both you and your dad came
from Elbaf like other Giants, right?

171
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,470
Usopp-sa, you know Elbaf?

172
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,190
Do I know it? Yes, of course!

173
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,190
The brave warriors of the
sea - Dorry and Broggy...

174
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,600
...are our close friends!

175
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,730
What?! Have you met those
legendary pirate bosses?!

176
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,030
Yeah, we have!

177
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,090
I can't believe it! I've never even met them!

178
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,910
My dad has been friends with
them since they were kids.

179
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,280
Really?!

180
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,540
Yeah. He told me about them all the time.

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,340
Sounds like they're having fun!

182
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,430
Let's have fun here too!

183
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,960
Yeah!

184
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,260
The song is "Let's Go to the Rescue"!

185
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,020
Yeehaw!

186
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,290
Go, go, let's go! To the Ill-Tempered Sea!

187
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,720
Shut up!

188
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,650
You got us in trouble, Brook!

189
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,390
Sorry! I'm really sorry!

190
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,570
Don't get in my way!

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,540
Move out of my way!

192
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,540
I've never heard of a pirate who

193
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,010
so brazenly boarded a Government-owned
cargo ship before.

194
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,730
Why did you do it?

195
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,970
I just wanted to take back
what you took from them!

196
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,790
Since you Navy people killed Whitebeard,
the New World is in disorder.

197
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,370
That island where the Government's ship was

198
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,030
moored was not an exception.

199
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,160
The islanders were on
the brink of starvation.

200
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,550
But the crew on that ship took away
all food that they had stored,

201
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,380
to provide for the World
Nobles' nightly feasts!

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm a cook!

203
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,260
I have to provide food for hungry people!

204
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,620
So you boarded the ship
to steal food for them?

205
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,650
The islands are in disorder
because of you pirates.

206
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,060
Don't shift the blame!

207
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,640
After all, we remain as far apart as ever.

208
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,160
We'll never be of the same mind!

209
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,520
You're right.

210
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,370
Somebody is raiding pirates these days.

211
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,270
Since we have a pirate on our
ship, we are possible targets.

212
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,210
Be on the look-out and shoot
anything that moves on the sea!

213
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,930
Yes, sir!

214
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,600
Guys, are you ready?

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Anytime.

216
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,920
We're in position. We're ready too!

217
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,580
Thank you all!

218
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,160
I couldn't even sneak onto their
ship if I were all by myself!

219
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,960
Don't thank us yet.

220
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,280
We haven't saved anybody yet.

221
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,110
He's right!

222
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,040
Ready?

223
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,070
Roger.

224
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,840
Cien Fleurs!

225
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,380
Okay, my turn.

226
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,930
Clutch!

227
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,390
What happened?!

228
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,850
I-It's a ghost!

229
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,280
I am not a ghost! I am a soul!

230
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,910
What's going on?

231
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,710
Now! Sneak in!

232
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,170
Roger! Go!

233
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh, Sanji-san, good job.

234
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,820
It's going well! We finished
the initial phase!

235
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,130
Huh?!

236
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,760
I can't see his face like that.

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,050
You're...

238
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,640
...Straw Hat Luffy!

239
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,520
Hey, frying pan pops!

240
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,730
D-Dad!

241
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,170
Lily?

242
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,660
Hey, Luffy, we cut the chains off!

243
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,570
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro?!

244
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,550
Not just Straw Hat! And that's...

245
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,540
Who is that?!

246
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm Sanji! Sanji from the Straw Hats!

247
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,080
What?!

248
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,510
Where did they come from?!

249
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,440
Look what he's done.

250
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,960
But I assumed something like this

251
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,630
would happen once I heard Luffy
was on the Shark Submerge.

252
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,840
Franky, get over here now!

253
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,020
There's been a change in plan!

254
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,900
Forget about the raft!

255
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,550
We'll put a rope around her father and split!

256
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,740
Roger!

257
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,120
Lily, go!

258
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,810
Uh-huh!

259
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,790
Straw Hat!

260
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,360
I won't let you get away this time!

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,070
That was close!

262
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,250
He's a vice admiral?

263
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,670
Yeah, he's pretty strong!

264
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,740
Oh yeah?

265
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,260
Looks like we can't avoid
an all-out battle, huh?

266
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,180
Dad!

267
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,810
Lily! Are you all right?!

268
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,380
Uh-huh! Dad, I missed you so much!

269
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,310
Dad!

270
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,350
You must be kidding! What's going on?!

271
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,950
Are you okay?!

272
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,480
What?!

273
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,200
Damage report!

274
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,410
Consider that our greeting.

275
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,540
Surface and finish them off at once!

276
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Yes, sir!

277
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,330
It broke the hull and we're taking on water!

278
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,540
--Where is the enemy ship?!
--We can't find it yet!

279
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,560
Estimate their location from
the track of the torpedoes and

280
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,910
concentrate fire there!

281
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,380
Yes, sir!

282
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,430
Prepare to fire! Go, Alpacacino!

283
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,500
Are they the pirate raiders?

284
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,330
Why are they firing at us Navy?!

285
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,980
Hey, pops! Are you alright?!

286
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm okay! Where's Lily?!

287
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,820
Dad! I'm here!

288
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,240
Another bomb?!

289
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,610
Gum-Gum...

290
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,410
...Balloon!

291
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,050
Move!

292
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,860
A man?!

293
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,080
Outta my way!

294
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,380
Luffy-sa!

295
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,170
Damn!

296
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,180
Usopp! Luffy, fell into the sea!

297
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,930
What?! I got it!

298
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,770
That was unexpected.

299
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,560
Who is that?

300
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,440
You're... Shuzo!

301
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,690
Oh, it's you! It's been quite a while!

302
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,720
I didn't know you were on board, Momonga...

303
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,740
You're a vice admiral now, aren't you?

304
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,030
Don't tell me...

305
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,290
...you're responsible for
all the raids on pirates!

306
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,420
Yes, I am! I'm gonna cut
this guy's head off too!

307
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,590
I won't let you do that!

308
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,510
Take a look around!

309
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,490
Just give him over to us. If you don't...

310
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,890
Why?!

311
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,870
You were a great Navy soldier.
Why are you doing this?

312
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,090
Do you wanna know?

313
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,760
I'll tell you then.

314
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,680
We're the Neo Navy, concerned
about today's New World.

315
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,890
We banded together to kill
all pirates in the New World!

316
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,470
How absurd to take a villain to Impel
Down and let him continue to live!

317
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,320
In the name of Master Z, I'm gonna kill
the pirate - Panz Fry, right here!

318
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,740
Did you say Z?!

319
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,910
You should not tell him that, Shuzo-san!

320
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,010
I forgot about that.

321
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, I don't care!

322
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,380
It doesn't matter that
you know our secret now

323
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,470
because all of you Navy people are
gonna die here among those pirates!

324
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,770
How could you do that to Dad and Luffy-sa!

325
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,400
Lily-chan!

326
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,870
What are Luffy and the silly swordsman doing?

327
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,830
Who are you now?

328
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,040
Me?! I'm Panz Fry's
daughter - Lily Enstomach!

329
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,290
So you're a pirate?! Then you die, too!

330
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,470
Iron Body!

331
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,730
Three-Section Lariat!

332
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,600
Lily-chan!

333
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,060
Another disturbance? I'm sick of this!

334
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,880
How dare you try to hit a lady!

335
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
You worthless piece of crap!

336
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,200
You...

337
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,780
--Who the hell are you?!
--Who the hell are you?!

338
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,030
Shuzo-san, I think he's "Black
Foot" Sanji of the Straw Hats!

339
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,900
He looks very different
from the wanted poster!

340
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
I assume he's had cosmetic surgery!

341
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,540
No, I haven't!

342
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,410
He's a pirate? What is his bounty?

343
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,230
It's 77 million berries!

344
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,130
--Humph! He's a nobody.
--What did you say?!

345
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,560
But he's a pirate too. Sink
them all into the sea!

346
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,930
Roger!

347
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,690
Augh! We're in big trouble!

348
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,940
Now, Lily-chan, shrink down!

349
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,600
Uh-huh!

350
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,670
I don't want to fight for pirates but...

351
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,310
...I won't let you do whatever
you like on this ship

352
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,590
while it's under the control of the Navy!

353
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,510
You're very sensible for a Navy soldier.

354
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,450
Praised by a pirate?

355
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,220
That is why I'd say today's Navy is useless.

356
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,970
Shame on you!

357
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,550
Shut up, you backstabber!

358
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,610
Pirate blah-blah... Navy blah-blah...

359
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,160
Enough with this bullshit!

360
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,270
Straw Hat!

361
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,170
Pops' heavenly food is...

362
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,590
...all mine!

363
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,840
He's a pirate with a 400 million
berry bounty - Straw Hat Luffy!

364
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Oh, 400 million, huh?

365
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,600
Great! I'll kill you all at once!

366
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,970
The Straw Hats have begun fighting the Marines

367
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,490
as well as the mysterious Neo Marines.

368
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,770
They fight each other to a draw.

369
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,010
Then, as Maubeugemour reveals
its unimaginable wrath

370
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,520
and rescuing Panz Fry seems impossible...

371
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,480
The Straw Hats pull off something incredible!

372
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,710
On the next episode of One Piece!

373
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,830
"Z's Ambition! A Great and
Desperate Escape Plan!"

374
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
