2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,710
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,080
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,190
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,690
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,580
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,340
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,840
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,420
Usopp Hammer!

25
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,560
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

26
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,320
Special Attack!

27
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,580
Fire Star!

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,430
Usopp Hammer!!

29
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,470
I win!

30
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,680
It serves you right!

31
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,940
I can kill humans like you

32
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,470
without even directly touching
you if I have some water.

33
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,350
That's the difference
between fishmen and humans.

34
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,660
Arlong!!

35
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,360
Big Sis Nami!

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Nami-san!

37
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,550
Hey, Nami!

38
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,310
I was about to crush
some pirates just now.

39
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,630
What did you come here for?

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
To kill you...

41
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,080
"Luffy At Full Power! Nami's
Determination and the Straw Hat"

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,240
To kill... me?

43
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,000
You never learn, do you?

44
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
How many times did you try to kill me

45
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,040
during the eight years
you were with us?

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,550
You tried assassination,
poison, sneak attacks...

47
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,630
Were you able to actually kill me?

48
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,100
You must be completely aware
that you mere humans can't kill me.

49
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,090
Now, listen. I won't kill you...

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,200
...and you can't escape from me...

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,520
Nami...

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,110
You'll be our surveyor forever.

53
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,870
But, as you know,
I'm a good-natured man.

54
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,760
If possible, I want you to be our
surveyor of your own free will.

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,290
So, how about this?

56
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,860
I'll be killing everyone here except you.

57
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,470
But if you happily come
back to the Arlong Pirates

58
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,480
and draw sea charts
as one of the leaders,

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,460
I don't mind letting those people
from Cocoyashi Village live.

60
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,670
But I can't let these guys live.

61
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,230
They went too far.

62
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,630
The question is who you'll be with.

63
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,590
You either take my side now and
get saved along with the villagers,

64
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,560
or be on these weaklings' side and
try fighting against me with everyone.

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,250
But with these guys
you depend on in this shape,

66
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,410
it's obvious that
it'll be a tragedy for you.

67
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,950
Nami...

68
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,840
Are you my friend?

69
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,910
Or... their friend?

70
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,990
Not fair...

71
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,170
If I say I'm friends
with Luffy and the others,

72
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,750
everyone will get killed.

73
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,150
And if I say I'm Arlong's friend,

74
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,090
then everyone from
the village will be saved.

75
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,230
With my words,

76
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,580
everyone will be...

77
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,330
That's despicable!

78
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,260
No matter what she chooses,
he's not going to give Nami freedom!

79
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,670
But!!

80
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Luffy...

81
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,870
Help me...

82
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,270
Of course I will!

83
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,970
I must not doubt his words!

84
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,290
Everyone, I'm sorry!

85
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,990
Please die with me!

86
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,800
All right!

87
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,970
We'll go for it!

88
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,510
We'll fight!!

89
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,330
I see...

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,370
Everyone wants to be killed...

91
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,020
P... Please! Please!

92
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,490
Live! Live! Live! Live! Live!

93
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Hm?

94
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,580
What the...?

95
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
Finally...

96
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,440
All we have to do now
is remove his leg weight...

97
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,820
Oh...

98
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,520
So that's what you meant...

99
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,050
Could it be?!

100
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,800
Big Bro Luffy!!

101
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,500
What?!

102
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,030
Hey, hang in there!

103
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,890
Come back to life!

104
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,950
30 seconds!

105
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,630
I won't last longer than that.

106
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,580
Zoro!

107
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,930
That'll be enough!

108
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,250
There isn't a fountain over there.

109
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,710
Could it be that rubber man?!

110
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,400
Don't worry about it.

111
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,900
It's nothing, you damn half-fish!

112
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,450
I thought I told you not
to say those words ever again...

113
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,580
...dying Zoro!

114
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,280
If I kick and break that leg weight,

115
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,740
he can fight.

116
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,030
Luffy, you're the only one
who can fight now!

117
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,940
In the sea, one with Devil Fruit
powers is supposed to lose

118
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,250
even the energy to struggle,
as well as his powers, and die.

119
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,510
If he's still alive,

120
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,220
that means someone is
putting a damper on this game.

121
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,950
Are you all right?!

122
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,110
Glad you're okay!

123
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,110
Yeah! Oh?

124
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,220
What?! What's the matter?!

125
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,840
Pops, what did you do with your
pinwheel? That was a cool one.

126
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,700
Who cares about that right now?!

127
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,400
Putting a damper?

128
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,170
It didn't seem like
a fair game from the start.

129
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,130
At any rate,

130
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,630
if there's a hindrance,
I need to check on it.

131
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,630
Out of my way.

132
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,800
Egg Star!

133
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,790
I've got your back, Zoro!

134
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,050
Big Bro Usopp! Is he all right?!

135
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,480
How brave! What a gallant arrival!

136
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,980
Fight to the full extent!

137
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,650
That's where you are?!

138
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,890
Usopp!

139
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,660
Listen, Nami!

140
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,160
I beat one of the leaders!

141
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,870
One of the leaders!
One of the leaders!

142
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,990
The guy with a face like this.

143
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,820
Fishmen are a piece of cake!

144
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,820
You defeated... Choo?!

145
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,010
Serves you right!

146
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,430
With my arrival, the fight
comes to a climax at once!

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,780
It heads into the final chapter!

148
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,990
Hey, can't you somehow escape on your own?

149
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,390
Oh, that's impossible.

150
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,340
I don't have any strength at all.

151
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,100
Come out! Come out! Come out!

152
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,080
Big Bro Cook!

153
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,270
I don't know what's
going on in the water,

154
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,180
but his action must be the key!

155
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,490
Big Bro Zoro!

156
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,330
Stand strong and stop Arlong!

157
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,850
Okay!

158
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,960
We have to somehow prevent
Arlong from going into the sea, huh?

159
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,930
I'll stop him from moving.

160
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,510
I won't let you have your way!

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,520
Hey, Arlong! Look this way!

162
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,270
Wha?! Big Bro Usopp!!

163
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,570
How brave!

164
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,500
Usopp!

165
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,330
Rubberband of Doom!

166
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,280
Standing in my way...

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,210
Looks like you want
to die first, Roronoa Zoro.

168
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Now! Go Zoro!!

169
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,660
What do you actually wanna do?!

170
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,930
No way I'll die.

171
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,750
I'll break your proud nose!

172
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,140
You fool...

173
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,440
It's a proud nose
because it's unbreakable.

174
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,640
If you were at your full strength,

175
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,000
you might've been
able to give it a scratch.

176
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,810
Big Bro...

177
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,270
Look over there!

178
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,990
Hm?

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,510
Ahh! That damn octopus is up!

180
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,940
And... what's he doing?

181
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,980
Dammit! I thought the rubber
band was going to fly at me!

182
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,440
What?!

183
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,030
What?!

184
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,570
See?! He was my target!

185
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,990
You were yelling "Arlong," weren't you?

186
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,140
Octopus...

187
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,670
Roronoa Zoro! I won't
let you have your way!

188
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,350
I'll crush your friend
who went into the sea!

189
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,920
You don't have to be concerned
since you'll all be dead, after all.

190
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,830
Big Bro!!

191
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,110
Nami-san's big sister!

192
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,620
Leave the rest to me!

193
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,680
A fishman!

194
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,380
Move away, Big Sister.

195
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,290
I'll break a rock
like that with my kick!

196
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,220
That octopus!

197
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,000
Octopus-Fritter Frenzy!!

198
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,550
Big Sister!

199
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,470
Zoro!!

200
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,350
So that was it?

201
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,050
That was too quick.

202
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,720
What's up with these bandages?

203
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,660
Did you fall somewhere?

204
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,660
What's this scar?

205
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,140
How can he still be alive
with a body like this?

206
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,400
How can he still be standing?!

207
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,230
What kind of eyes are they?

208
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,440
Are they the eyes
of someone who's dying?

209
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,440
He's a man I need to kill for sure,

210
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,690
right here right now!

211
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,830
If a person stays put,

212
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,320
their wounds won't be opened...

213
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,530
That's right.

214
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,370
You find your situation amusing?

215
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,120
I'm not talking about me...

216
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,490
I'm talking about the Octo-Man.

217
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,420
What?!

218
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,070
I thought I told you...

219
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,210
We win this game.

220
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,900
Dammit!

221
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,760
That scared me a bit!

222
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,140
You're the one who made this whole
thing complicated in the first place!

223
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,750
All right!

224
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,610
Go and beat up that shark bastard,

225
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,280
you damn idiot!

226
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,980
Is it coming, kid?

227
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,120
It's coming!!

228
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,760
Wahhhhh! I'm back!!

229
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,470
Rubber boy!

230
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,650
Big Bro Luffy!!

231
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,300
Luffy!

232
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,980
That damn rubber man...!

233
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,940
You're late, idiot!

234
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,830
Zoro!!

235
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,420
Huh? Hey! Stop it!

236
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,670
You aren't gonna...

237
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,950
Let's switch places!

238
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,040
You idiot!

239
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,630
Gum-Gum... Bell!!

240
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,340
And, Whip!!

241
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,420
Gum-Gum... Pistol!!

242
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,470
Gatling!!

243
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,960
All right!

244
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,950
Did you do something?

245
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,640
It's not working!!

246
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Yep. That was my warm-up.

247
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
That idiot!

248
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,710
I'm gonna kill him!

249
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,830
What a bunch of scum,

250
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,830
nobly hanging on...

251
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,480
You'd have been happier if you
died at the bottom of the sea...

252
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,940
Hm? Not really.

253
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm happy that they saved me.

254
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,780
Can you understand my anger?

255
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,400
It's the anger of seeing my
dear brothers crushed by worms.

256
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,360
You'll realize soon enough that
you should've died without fighting.

257
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,940
Is Big Bro Luffy gonna be okay?

258
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,470
All his fierce attacks
weren't effective at all...

259
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,340
More importantly,
how far did Big Bro Zoro fly?!

260
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,920
Go Luffy! I've got your back!

261
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,550
You don't have to worry about his back.

262
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,160
If he loses, you guys will all die, too.

263
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,230
Yeah, we will...

264
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,800
If that happens, it's the
end of the East Blue, too.

265
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,570
What's the terrifying difference
between you and me?

266
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,820
Nose.

267
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,970
Jaw?

268
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,510
I wonder if Big Bro's joking...

269
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,550
No, he's definitely serious.

270
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,400
Webs!

271
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,560
Species!!

272
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,740
Such a fool! He hurt
himself by biting on a rock!

273
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,690
Now his teeth're brok...

274
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,240
He crushed the stone
pillar with his teeth!!

275
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,540
Ahh! That's scary!

276
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,480
What a man!

277
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,380
If he gets you with that,

278
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,810
he won't just give you bite marks,
he'll bite clear through your bones!

279
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,230
You see? This is the
inherent power of a fishman.

280
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,730
Heaven discriminated
against you humans

281
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,720
and made you powerless
creatures that bow before fishmen.

282
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,800
You humans are inferior creatures.

283
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,360
We were on a different level
from the moment we were born.

284
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,140
I'll show you...

285
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,350
...the real difference
between you and me...

286
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,050
Yeah, why don't you?

287
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,240
No way I'll lose against a fish.

288
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
I am...

289
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,290
...the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

290
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

291
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

292
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

293
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

294
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

295
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

296
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

297
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

298
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

299
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

300
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

301
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,310
Oh? Where did Arlong go?

302
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,480
Luffy! The sea!

303
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,980
The sea? Whoa! There's a shark!

304
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,310
That's Arlong!

305
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,650
Oh, he ran away?

306
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,650
This isn't good! His ability
doubles in the water!

307
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,890
Ahh! Watch out!

308
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,440
Wahhh!

309
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,440
Luffy!!

310
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

311
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,330
"Explosion! Fishman Arlong's
Fierce Assault From the Sea!"

312
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
