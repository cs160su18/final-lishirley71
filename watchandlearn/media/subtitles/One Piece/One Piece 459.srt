00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

3
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to the sky after the rain

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,790
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,790
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

10
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,290
The word "thank you" has faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,290
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,460
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,460
Because I don't want to lose something precious

46
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,700
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,240
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,550
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,340
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,780
Luffy is headed to the Navy Headquarters in order to rescue his brother, Ace!

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,580
Now, there are only 3 hours left before the public execution of Portgaz D. Ace...

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,330
"Ticking Down to the Time of Battle! The Navy's Strongest Lineup in Position!"

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,010
Stand up.

64
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,060
Climb.

65
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,760
"South Blue"

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,800
It's in 3 hours now! I wonder if Whitebeard has arrived yet.

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,300
I don't know. Do you think he's really gonna be there?

68
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,350
He's a big deal but isn't he too old?

69
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,390
You think so?

70
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:25,010
He was around before the Great Pirate Era. He must be senile by now.

71
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,560
We haven't heard his name in any big news for years.

72
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,910
How can you guys take this so lightly?

73
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,250
Because he's unignorable, the Navy HQ has called up its elites and...

74
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,540
...is expecting him with all their forces.

75
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,670
I'm almost certain that Whitebeard is going to appear.

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,220
And then what's gonna happen?

77
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,470
I don't know. How am I supposed to know?

78
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,850
"East Blue"

79
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,040
He's a pirate of a different era.

80
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,310
Is it possible for him to beat the Navy HQ?

81
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,360
It's not possible for any pirates to attack Marineford.

82
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,890
That's not true. I think it was 20 years ago,

83
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,740
a pirate called Shiki the Golden Lion invaded Marineford

84
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,870
and left the Navy HQ half destroyed.

85
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,230
This time it's going to be worse.

86
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,630
No matter who wins, a lot of people will die.

87
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,440
It'd be better if he didn't appear.

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,390
If nothing besides the execution happens, that'd be for the best.

89
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,310
"North Blue"

90
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,610
Hey, we want drinks, old guy!

91
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,120
Are you asking me to open the bar on a day like this? We're expecting a big war in any minute!

92
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,040
Go home! If the world's still here tomorrow, I'll open it!

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,870
Then just sell us some drinks! It feels like we're the ones who're on the scaffold!

94
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,540
We can't do without drinking!

95
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,510
He's not just another old man.

96
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,970
"West Blue"

97
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,970
He hasn't lost it at all!

98
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:21,350
It was just a year ago, when we saw him sitting right there...

99
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,570
...we thought we were dead.

100
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,240
"Grand Line"

101
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,240
Is Whitebeard that outrageous?

102
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,080
Even those kids know it. They're singing as they jump rope.

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,960
The pirate Whitebeard is scarier than a devil!

104
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,350
Oh, God!

105
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Where is this world headed?

106
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,500
On the island of Marineford home of the Navy Headquarters,

107
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,060
lies a huge city mainly populated by families of the Navy.

108
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,290
An evacuation order has been issued to all residents at this time.

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,450
And at Sabaody Archipelago at the evacuation site,

110
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,510
residents are watching the proceedings of the execution on monitors.

111
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,200
Reporters and cameramen from various places are...

112
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,150
...standing by here to break the news quickly to the world.

113
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,200
That's really the best of Navy HQ.

114
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,530
I assume that Whitebeard knows about this.

115
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,120
But still, will he venture to be there?

116
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,450
Every look-out ship that the Navy sent has been swiftly sunk

117
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
and there has been no report of a sighting of Whitebeard.

118
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,960
So the tension at Marineford continues to rise.

119
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,330
And there is less than 3 hours left until the looming execution.

120
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,640
"Navy"

121
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,410
I have problem with that. Is that really necessary?

122
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,980
This public execution is not just an execution of a pirate.

123
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,510
It has great significance for the future of the world.

124
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,430
That's why it's necessary to...

125
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:10,940
You are responsible for this matter since you are one of the parties involved.

126
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,450
Don't forget that, Garp.

127
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,580
"Marineford Navy Headquarters"

128
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,400
Hurry and get ready!

129
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,900
Hey you, don't lag behind!

130
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't slacken your pace!

131
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,910
No matter what happens, it'll last only 3 hours!

132
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,580
Then it's all finished!

133
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,760
Elite soldiers are summoned from all over the world--totaling almost one hundred thousand.

134
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,020
The crescent-shaped bay area and the whole island are surrounded by 50 Navy ships

135
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,400
and numerous cannons have been set at the bay area.

136
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,820
And in front of all the marshaled forces that can be seen from sea...

137
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,580
...stand 5 ruffians who hold the key to the war. Pirates--The Seven Warlords!

138
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
"Bartholomew Kuma"

139
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,420
"Gecko Moria"

140
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,340
"Don Quixote Doflamingo"

141
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,260
"Dracule Mihawk"

142
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,180
"Boa Hancock"

143
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,270
It's...

144
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,690
...the admirals!

145
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,230
I don't know why but I find them so intimidating!

146
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,860
Guarding closely below the scaffold are...

147
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,410
...the Navy's greatest powers...

148
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,440
...the three admirals!

149
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
"Navy Admiral
Aokiji Kuzan"

150
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,380
"Navy Admiral
Akainu Sakazuki"

151
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,760
"Navy Admiral
Kizaru Borsalino"

152
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,030
Every force of justice imaginable is...

153
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:02,760
...now waiting for the Whitebeard Pirates to stop them from rescuing Ace!

154
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,390
Listen, Luffy.

155
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,120
We have to live without leaving any regrets.

156
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,350
Uh-huh.

157
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,470
We gotta go out to sea someday...

158
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,000
...and live as we like.

159
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,990
Freer than anyone else.

160
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,610
I see it!

161
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,430
Hey! Jimbei!

162
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,020
I see the Gate of Justice already! That was fast!

163
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,190
No, it wasn't! If the wind were right, we could have gotten here faster.

164
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,530
However...

165
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,490
I warn you.

166
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,590
As long as we don't open the Gate of Justice, you guys can't get to Marineford

167
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,710
or even get out of the Tub Current!

168
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,960
There is no sea for you all to get away to or to live on!

169
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,720
So now, how can we get through the gate?

170
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,470
You guys! It's almost time for...

171
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,060
Huh? What is it?

172
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,320
Time for Captain Buggy to conquer the world!

173
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,940
That's right!

174
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,900
The Navy HQ is nothing!

175
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,780
Whitebeard is nothing!

176
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,490
Who is the next King of the Pirates?

177
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,490
Captain Buggy!

178
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,410
That's right!

179
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,620
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

180
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,480
Ace!

181
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,540
Hey, look! "Fire Fist" Ace has come out!

182
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,060
This is the man...

183
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,220
...who may trigger a war that will shake the world!

184
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,230
And he is the one who holds the fate of the world now!

185
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,990
Okay, Garp? I'll tell them everything!

186
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,190
So be it. I'll be downstairs.

187
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,580
--Step aside for a minute.
--Yes, sir!

188
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,320
--Fleet Admiral Sengoku!
--What's going on?

189
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,060
--Give me a Transponder Snail.
--Yes, sir.

190
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,230
I have something to tell you all.

191
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,380
Portgaz D. Ace...

192
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,230
It's about the great significance of his death today.

193
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,040
It's not your fault.

194
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,950
Women are very sweet at times like this, Tsuru-chan.

195
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,330
Ace, tell them the name of your father.

196
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,580
Father? Why is that important now?

197
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,630
My father is Whitebeard.

198
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,670
No!

199
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,850
Yes, he is! Whitebeard is my only father!

200
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,880
We looked for you with our eyes wide open at that time.

201
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,810
Because we heard that there might be a child of that man on some island.

202
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:21,320
Based on a small amount of reliable information from Cipher Pol,

203
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,780
we checked all newborns...

204
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,780
...and preborn children...

205
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,250
...and their mothers but we couldn't find you.

206
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,010
No wonder.

207
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,140
Your mother risked her life to bear you.

208
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,720
She used a trick that can be called mother's pride.

209
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,230
That has misled us... Indeed, the whole world.

210
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,650
There is an island called Batelira in the South Blue.

211
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,900
Your mother's name is Portgaz D. Rouge.

212
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,740
She did something that completely defied natural law...

213
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,790
...for the love of her child.

214
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,710
She kept her baby inside her womb for 20 months!

215
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,130
No way.

216
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,020
And as soon as she gave birth to you,

217
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,300
she lost all of her strength and passed away right there.

218
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,190
A year and 3 months after the father's death,

219
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,230
the child was born with the blood of the world's most heinous man in his veins.

220
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,360
That was you!

221
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,160
You know it, surely?

222
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,340
They can't blame a child whose not born.

223
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,030
Garp!

224
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,680
Look after my child!

225
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,000
Your father is...

226
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,390
...the King of the Pirates -

227
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,350
Gold Roger!

228
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,840
"Fire Fist" Ace is a son of Gold Roger?!

229
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,620
This is huge news.

230
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,710
Call the head office! Let's issue an extra!

231
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,430
Does it continue?

232
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,110
Still?

233
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
The bloodline of the King of the Pirates?!

234
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,250
The secret of Ace's origin has been revealed.

235
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,350
His father Roger's feelings, and his mother
Rouge's strong resolve lay behind it all.

236
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,640
At Marineford, Whitebeard's fleet silently approaches.

237
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,070
On the next episode of One Piece!

238
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,950
"A Vast Fleet Appears! Here Come the Whitebeard Pirates!"

239
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
