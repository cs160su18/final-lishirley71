2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
If you're prepared to die, then come with me.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,540
I'll give you a ride... on a sea train!

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,050
Whoooa! There it is!

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,840
Its name is Rocketman.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,510
We can't even allow passengers to be on board.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,930
Rocketman!

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,430
It sounds fast!

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,580
Use it. I've finished servicing it.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,110
Water and coal have been loaded
and it's storing the steam right now.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,310
So you were getting it ready for us, pops?!

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,850
Wait to rejoice until you survive the ride.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,580
After all, this was a failure built
before Puffing Tom was completed.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,290
No matter how much you tune it up,
its steam engine can't control the speed.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,710
I can't guarantee your lives.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,880
Okay! Thanks, Ice pops!

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,220
Straw Hat!

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,800
Please... take us with you!

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,310
Our Bro, Franky, was taken
in by the Government!

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,100
We want to go after them... but we can't
get through Aqua Laguna by ourselves!

21
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,740
Please!

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,030
We want to save Bro!

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,900
Get on.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,280
Hurry!

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,500
Straw Hat...

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,790
Thank you!

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,830
We're deeply indebted to you!

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,410
Well then, let's go, shall we?!

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,770
Now... pirates!
Don't go getting thrown off, okay?!

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,580
Now departing Water Seven for Enies Lobby...

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,240
Here comes the sea train Rocketman!

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,550
All right! Depart!

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,960
We're gonna go...!
To get everything back!

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,260
It's all right! Now let's move forward

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,630
with the sun always in our hearts

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,060
As power passes through our clasped hands

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,600
let's grab hold of our wishes

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:04,740
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

39
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,920
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,010
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

42
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,520
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,400
but what you cherish most will be right there

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,400
And if you get into a jam

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'll always be there to protect you

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,610
It's all right! Now let's move forward

47
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,120
with the sun always in our hearts

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,330
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

49
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,630
and gaze at the light beyond

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,340
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

51
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,630
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

52
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,100
So let's grab hold of our wishes

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,480
under the same flag-- together, we're one

54
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,770
One Piece

55
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:29,990
"Rescue Our Friends! A Bond
Among Foes Sworn with Fists!"

56
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,890
We're coming out at a place like this?!

57
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,850
It's an underground canal.

58
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,070
Luffy! Are you okay?!

59
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,750
I-I got some water in my nose.

60
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,650
Huh?

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,790
That's gonna happen when you stand out there!

62
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,620
Be careful!

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,900
Boy, I didn't see that coming!

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,240
But... it's getting fun!

65
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,850
H-H-Hey, monster granny!

66
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,750
Hey, aren't we falling?!

67
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,540
The exit is real close now.
We'll keep on going and go down in one shot!

68
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,230
What? No way... What?!

69
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,500
All right! The sea train has come out!

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,470
Guys! Now we're gonna charge forth, too!

71
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,180
Yeah!

72
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,970
Jump! Sodom! Gomorrah!

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,680
Wh-What the heck...?!

74
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Straw Hat!

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,150
Thank you for helping us,
the entire Franky Family!

76
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,600
Fire the connection cannons!

77
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,210
Whoa! Cool!

78
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,050
Those must be the highest-grade bulls.

79
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,470
Not bad!

80
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,540
Dammit! Those bastards!

81
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,450
You idiots!
Don't be reckless!

82
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,750
Thanks for your help!

83
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,220
What a cheerful bunch!

84
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,290
Hey, monster granny!
Is this as fast as it goes?

85
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,740
It's not fast at all.

86
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,500
Well, just hold your horses.

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Once it gets on the railway, you'll see.

88
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,790
Railway?

89
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,250
Where the heck is that?

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,740
Looks like it's drifted quite a ways away.

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,110
But I've observed the sea train
since its development.

92
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,030
Don't underestimate me!

93
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,860
I see it! Let's go!

94
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,280
Urgent message from the engine room!

95
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,250
The train will get on the railway shortly.
Once it does, it'll rapidly accelerate!

96
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,320
Hold on tight to something so
that your injuries won't be severe.

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,610
So, we'll get injured regardless?

98
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,840
Tsk! I missed it.
But I'm just getting started!

99
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,350
Hey! Behave!

100
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,540
Grandma! That was close!

101
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,980
That was close! A little to the right!

102
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,650
Just wait and see!

103
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,900
I'll make it next... Huh?!

104
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,460
Chimney! Gonbe!

105
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,120
You guys came with us?!

106
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,300
Yep, we did!

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,520
For God's sake!

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,660
Hurry up and
come inside!

109
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,570
Or you'll be blown away!

110
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,800
We're okay! We're okay!

111
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,760
Chimney!

112
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,380
I'm gonna fall!

113
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,060
D-Don't let go!

114
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,790
I'm being blown away!

115
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,070
H-Hold on a sec, okay?
I'll stop the train right away!

116
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,510
Oh, that's right!

117
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,730
The brake doesn't work on this train!

118
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Oops! Hm? What the heck?
That kinda looks fun.

119
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,550
Ah! Straw Hat brother! Hello!

120
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,420
Straw Hat! Hurry and get
Chimney and Gonbe inside!

121
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,190
Once we get on the railway,
they'll be blown away!

122
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,640
Okay!

123
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,250
Ah! All right! They got on the railway!

124
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,020
Really?! Hey! Let me see!

125
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,840
Yeah, you're right. I see, I see...

126
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,310
Just as you'd expect from Kokoro-san!
She's something else!

127
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,500
Yeah, indeed.

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
For a while, I was afraid of
what was going to happen.

129
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,930
Indeed, indeed.
That's exactly right.

130
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,970
With those high waves, it must've
been hard to find the railway.

131
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,870
Yeah, indeed.
You're exactly righ... Ah...

132
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,540
Indeed, indeed, indeed. Ah...

133
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,540
Well, well, well, she's something...

134
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,260
She's something else!

135
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,280
I-I-Indeed...

136
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,280
W-We definitely have to let Iceberg-san know.

137
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,190
Y-You're right.
I-I'm sure he's worried.

138
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,460
Well, well, well, indeed. Indeed!

139
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,160
Rock...!

140
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,120
Paper...!

141
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, I bet he's fine.

142
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,960
We're talking about a guy who
survived being hit by a sea train...

143
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,970
Did you know... that the violent
disciple of Tom, Cutty Flam, died?

144
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,440
He was hit by the sea train.

145
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,150
Iceberg...

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,300
you can do it.

147
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,320
You're the first disciple of Tom,
the world's greatest shipwright.

148
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,580
I'm sure you can do it... I'm sure...

149
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,310
Kokoro-san, let's drink
together one of these days...

150
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,530
...when we have something to drink to.

151
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,690
Yeah.

152
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,310
Tom-san... please just watch.

153
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,390
I'll take over your will.

154
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,850
I'll protect... everything...

155
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,940
This town... and these blueprints as well.

156
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,360
"Four years later"

157
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,940
Iceberg-san, you have a guest.

158
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,660
He said you'd know who if I tell you "Cutty Flam."

159
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,730
Franky...?

160
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,570
Shall I show him in here?

161
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,030
No...

162
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,430
turn him away.

163
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,710
What a roundabout way of meeting.

164
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,680
Well... anyway, what's up with
that funny looking body of yours?

165
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,810
Shut up! Since my whole
body came to be of no use,

166
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,850
I rebuilt my body using
iron scraps and escaped death!

167
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,280
More importantly,

168
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,730
I heard that your company contracts to
build ships for the World Government!

169
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm not gonna tolerate you doing
things that help the Government!

170
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,620
They took Tom-san and...

171
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,530
And who made the weapons
that caused the incident?!

172
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm sure you have things you wanna say to me,

173
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,080
but don't think that I've forgiven
you in the past four years.

174
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,730
I'm surprised that you had the nerve
to show your face after what happened!

175
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,710
What'd you say?!

176
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,440
I completely thought that you were dead...

177
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,430
...since the Government told me so.

178
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:38,050
Even if Tom-san forgave you,
I'm not going to forgive you!

179
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,610
H-Hey! What the hell are these?!

180
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,450
Aren't these the blueprints we
saw for that ancient weapon?!

181
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,410
Don't use the name Cutty Flam from now on.

182
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,330
The Government couldn't
get this out of Tom-san.

183
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,840
It's only a matter of time before I get targeted.

184
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,340
Leave the island with them... Franky.

185
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,300
Leave this island?

186
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,510
Cutty Flam from Tom's Workers is dead.

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,680
As long as you don't use that name,
there'll be no connection between us.

188
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,560
In addition, if you leave the island,

189
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,760
the blueprints' whereabouts
will vanish into the darkness.

190
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,830
H-Hold on a sec!

191
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,350
What happens if they come after you
when you don't have them?!

192
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,650
I've said what I came to say.

193
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,580
Hey! Hey, Iceberg!

194
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,020
We may not see each other again.

195
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,570
Hey! Wait!

196
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,280
Do you want to end up like Tom-san?

197
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,230
Keep the blueprints with you!

198
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,800
If, by any chance, you find that your
life is in danger, just hand them over!

199
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,130
If you don't wanna do that, then you
can even burn them before their eyes!

200
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,290
If you were me, would you do that?

201
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,250
Tom-san achieved so many great things,

202
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,630
and he gave up everything in order to
preserve these blueprints for the future.

203
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,440
At least, as long as there's a risk

204
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,260
that a woman named Nico Robin
can restore the weapon,

205
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,480
the world needs those blueprints to fight back.

206
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,310
If I continue to keep them with me...

207
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,200
...even if I am to be killed...
I won't give them to the Government!

208
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,150
Are you sure?

209
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,940
I may build this weapon.

210
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,230
Is it okay to trust me?

211
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,410
Doesn't my giving them
to you answer that question?

212
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,620
We never change, huh?

213
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,950
Whenever we meet face to face,
we yell at each other.

214
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:29,340
I still won't forgive you... and you
may feel the same about me, too.

215
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,080
Franky... I'm... really...

216
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,850
...glad that... you're alive.

217
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Wait! Stupid-berg!
I'm not gonna leave this island!

218
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,430
I'll do what I wanna do!

219
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,370
I would never do what you
tell me to, even if it kills me!

220
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,830
Never!

221
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,290
You Moron-ky! Why don't
you get what I'm saying?!

222
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,270
This is in order to protect the blueprints!

223
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,830
Shut up! It's you who's not getting it!

224
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,590
I'm not gonna leave no matter what!

225
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,550
Tsk! Why am I remembering
him at a time like this?!

226
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,770
Is that idiot... Iceberg... doing okay?

227
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,230
We killed him.

228
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,190
Ahh... I thought I'd die.

229
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,460
Well, obviously!
Geez, I told you, didn't I?!

230
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,400
I said you'd get blown away!

231
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,420
Ow, ow...

232
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,780
Anyway, that acceleration sure was crazy.

233
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,710
--Geez...
--Yeah, really, that scared me!

234
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,540
I hit my lower back.

235
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,310
Hold on a sec...

236
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,770
There are weird guys in here.

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,710
What?! Who are they?!

238
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,850
You guys!

239
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,230
You, too!

240
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,110
I decided to go with you guys.

241
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,820
No matter how hard I tried
to stop you, you didn't stop.

242
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,330
The enemy you'd go this far
to rescue your friend from

243
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,620
is also the culprit who tried to kill Iceberg-san.

244
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,290
In addition, there are lots of
things that I wanna say to them!

245
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,340
Paulie! We're not gonna
let you steal all the glory!

246
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,610
Thinking that we'd be able to find
Iceberg-san's assassins if we followed you,

247
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,020
we hid in the tender together!

248
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,520
So... it seems we were right.

249
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,770
Let us join you guys in this battle.

250
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,270
And, of course...

251
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,060
...the foes you're gonna get revenge
on took Big Bro Franky as well.

252
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,210
That's right! And we clearly know who they are!

253
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,190
Hey, Galley-La!

254
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,870
How are you gonna take responsibility
if something happens to Bro?!

255
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,280
Shut up! It's Iceberg-san
who's endured the most!

256
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,000
What're you guys going on about?!

257
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,130
Paulie! First, explain it to us! What's going on?!

258
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,540
He's right, Paulie.

259
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,100
You know the true culprit, don't you?

260
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,420
Just tell us.

261
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,340
We're not that dense.
We have a rough idea as to who it is.

262
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,800
We're not gonna be surprised.

263
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,320
Well, I guess you could guess if they
suddenly disappeared for no reason.

264
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,560
Then, I'll tell you straight.

265
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,580
The true identities of those masked men are...

266
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,860
...Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa and Blueno from the bar.

267
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,320
It was them who tried to kill Iceberg-san!

268
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,330
What?! You never even guessed that?!

269
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,890
B-But you said they went
back to their hometowns!

270
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,490
Why would they, during an emergency like this?!

271
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,400
We thought it was Michael and
Hoichael from the backstreets.

272
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,920
--That's right!
--Who the hell are they?!

273
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,120
What?! You don't know them?!
They're famous in the backstreets!

274
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,260
That's right!

275
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,340
How would I know?!
To start with, you guys are--

276
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,930
All right! Boy, I ate a lot.
I'm finally full.

277
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,930
Oof.

278
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,020
Well, then...

279
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,190
Although we got in fights back in
town with both the Franky Family

280
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,400
and the Galley-La shipwrights,
we're all going after the same enemy now.

281
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,550
The strongest one among the guys
we're gonna fight is that pigeon guy.

282
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,120
He's mine. I'm definitely gonna beat him up.

283
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,460
Yeah. This is a battle to get back
what those four took from us.

284
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,670
In any case, if we don't
reach them, nothing will end.

285
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,090
Ahh! Grandma! Grandma!
It's Aqua Laguna!

286
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,360
Oh? It's already here?!

287
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,640
Chimney! Let me see it!

288
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,460
This is bad!

289
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,610
Kokoro-san! Is it okay for you to leave
the engine room at a time like this?!

290
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,580
We somehow need to dodge that high wave!

291
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,150
I told you, didn't I?
That we can't control Rocketman.

292
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,830
Even when we want to operate it,
nothing works, including the brake.

293
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,450
My job ended when the train got on the railway.

294
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,510
Hence, the train is always
running at full throttle.

295
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,890
No one can stop it anymore.

296
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,710
Oh, no... Luffy!

297
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,550
If we don't do anything, the train will
crash into the big wave! Hey, Luffy!

298
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,930
When we have the same goal...

299
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,760
...it's senseless to fight separately.

300
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,590
Yeah.

301
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,310
You're right.

302
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,770
Listen. We're comrades.

303
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,240
Our friends are also in
the train that left before us.

304
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,700
Our fighting force will still increase.

305
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,450
Guys! Don't let that big wave beat us!

306
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,120
We'll all achieve our goal!

307
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,130
Let's go!

308
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,330
Yeah!

309
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,410
We had a dream that day

310
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,200
Our belief in ourselves

311
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:47,220
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

312
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:56,760
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

313
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:06,940
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

314
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,530
In the end, we can all surely smile

315
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,710
Hey, look! That wave is really huge! Amazing!

316
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,090
Ahhh! If we don't do something,
it'll collide with Rocketman!

317
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,510
Everyone, brace yourself!

318
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,180
Are we gonna die?

319
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,620
Well then, let's do it, shall we, Captain?

320
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,980
--Yeah!
--What're you guys gonna do?!

321
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,410
We're gonna fire a cannon!

322
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

323
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,300
"Smash the Wave! Luffy and Zoro
Use the Strongest Combo!"

324
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
