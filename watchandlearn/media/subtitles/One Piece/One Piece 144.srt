00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,470
Anyway, that sure was an interesting place.

20
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,150
Really? I've had enough of that ship graveyard!

21
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, it's not like I wanna live there,
but I wanna visit from time to time.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,580
Was it really that nice?

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,340
Hm? Rain?

24
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,270
It's... not rain...

25
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,290
Hail?

26
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,830
No... something's fall--

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,980
What?!

28
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,640
"Caught Log! The King of Salvagers, Masira!"

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,060
Hang on!! Hold on to the ship!!

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,440
What?! What is it?! What is it?!

31
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,030
Dream! Yeah, this must be a dream!

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,810
Dream?! Goo--

33
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,710
Hey! More stuff's falling! Be careful!

34
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,480
Turn the rudder! The rudder!

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,180
No way that'll work in these waves!

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,370
Luffy, protect the ship!
It can't take this any longer!

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,490
Got it! Hm? Usopp?

38
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,620
Cast aside your worries.
Calmly close your eyes...

39
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,430
When you open your eyes,
a quiet morning lies before you...

40
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,270
Bones!!

41
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,320
You idiot! Don't throw it this way!!

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,020
More stuff's  falling!!

43
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,960
Bones!!

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,190
You idiot! Don't throw it this way!!

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,710
Why the heck did a ship fall from the sky?!

46
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,250
How weird...

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,750
There's nothing in the sky.

48
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,580
Oh man, the Grand Line is a crazy place!

49
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,590
First, we see a ship graveyard
inside a rainbow mist,

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,090
and then a ship falls from the sky!

51
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,710
Ahh!

52
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,730
What's wrong, Nami-san?

53
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,090
What're we gonna do?! Our Log Pose is broken!

54
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,670
It's stuck pointing upwards.

55
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:18,030
That's not it. It was updated by
an island with stronger magnetism.

56
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,670
What?!

57
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,130
If the Log Pose needle is pointing upwards,

58
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,100
that means the log has
been caught by the sky island.

59
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,880
Sky island?!

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,100
What's that?

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,180
A floating island?!

62
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,580
D-Did that ship and those
bones fall from there?

63
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,940
But I can't see anything
like an island in the sky.

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,500
That's not it.

65
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,590
To be precise, a sea is what's floating.

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,360
A sea?!

67
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,830
I'm getting more and more confused.

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,730
Yaay! There's a sea with an
island floating in the sky?!

69
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,270
Alright! Let's head there right away!

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,940
Hey, guys! Turn the rudder upwards!

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,950
Upwards rudder full!

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,220
In any case, you can't turn upwards, Captain.

73
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,470
To be honest, I've never seen the
sky island, nor do I know much about it.

74
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,760
Yeah! It's impossible for an
island or a sea to float in the air!

75
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,930
So the Log Pose really must be broken.

76
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,490
No, Navigator.

77
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:26,050
Our concern right now should not be the
Log Pose, it should be how we get to the sky.

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,720
No matter what weird situations
this ship gets caught up in,

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,610
or how panicked we get,

80
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,580
we must not doubt the Log Pose.
This is an ironclad rule.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,430
What we should doubt is rather
the common sense in our heads.

82
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,360
There's definitely an
island where it's pointing.

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,810
What's that woman doing,
opening the coffin?!

84
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,230
Can you learn something from that?

85
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,010
I don't know.

86
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,720
You've got strange interests!

87
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,250
A pretty woman and the dead,
now that's an interesting combination.

88
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,210
Hm? Where's Luffy?

89
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,120
Jump, Luffy!

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,660
Okay!

91
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,730
What're they doing now?

92
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,080
Exploration, they said.

93
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh, restoration complete!

94
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,000
The holes here are man-made.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,530
I see... then this guy was
pierced there and died, huh?

96
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,740
No, these are indications of medical treatment.

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,230
It's craterization, isn't it, Doctor?

98
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah, in the past, they made holes in the
skull in order to constrain a brain tumor.

99
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
But that's a medical
technique from very long ago.

100
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,070
That's right. It's been at least
200 years since he died.

101
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,350
He was in his early 30s.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,050
He fell sick while traveling
on the sea and died.

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,430
The reason his teeth remained in good
condition compared to his other bones is...

104
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,740
...because tar was rubbed onto them.

105
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,720
This custom is characteristic of
some areas in the South Blue.

106
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,610
So considering history, that was a ship
for an exploration party from the past.

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,140
Here it is. The "St. Briss" of Briss,
a kingdom in the South Blue.

108
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,210
It set sail 208 years ago.

109
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
That's the same ship as the one that fell.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,070
Come to think of it,
it had a symbol like that.

111
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,170
This ship probably wandered in
the sky for at least 200 years.

112
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,410
You can find out all that
just by looking at bones?

113
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,750
Dead people may not speak,
but they do hold information.

114
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,450
If the ship was for an exploration party,

115
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,780
it should still hold various
records and evidence.

116
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah... but the ship sank in the sea...

117
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,810
What're you guys doing?!

118
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,150
Luffy! Hang in there!

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
Help me!

120
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, everyone!

121
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,750
I did it!

122
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,430
I found something incredible! Look at this!

123
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,540
Ah!

124
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,710
A map of the sky island?!

125
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,260
Skypiea...

126
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,410
See? See?

127
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,670
Does this mean that there's
really an island in the sky?!

128
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,130
Yahoo!

129
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,510
Alright! The sky island exists!
It's a dream island!

130
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,120
We can go to a dream island!

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,100
A dream island!!

132
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,790
Don't get so carried away!
This only means it might be possible.

133
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,310
There're tons of fake maps out there.

134
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,330
Er... Sorry! It exists! I'm sure it exists, but...

135
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,100
Listen, Luffy! I'm telling you,

136
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,400
Uhm, Nami, please treat
the ship with care.

137
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,120
we don't know how to get there!

138
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,220
You're the navigator! Figure something out!

139
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,380
There are some things you can't just "figure out," you know!

140
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,210
Nami-san's cute when she's angry, too.

141
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,210
I don't care! We're going to the sky!!

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,240
This is getting us nowhere.

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,850
In any case, we can't move
the ship forward this way!

144
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,870
What we need now is
information, as Robin said.

145
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,380
If a huge ship like that really went to the sky,

146
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,140
then there's definitely a way
for this ship to go there as well.

147
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,110
Let's somehow pull out whatever
records remain in that ship!

148
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,440
But the ship has completely sunk.

149
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,330
If it sank, then we'll salvage it!

150
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
Alright!

151
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,410
As if we could!!

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
What's salvage?

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,860
It means to pull up a sunken ship.

154
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,290
But it won't work, since that ship is too big.

155
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,530
Well, well... You really
make us do reckless things.

156
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,310
Er...

157
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,800
Nami-san! I'll be sure to find a clue to the sky!

158
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm counting on you!

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,310
Worry not, there are no defects in my design.

160
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,530
Then, I wish you... good luck!

161
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,860
Oh, boy...

162
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,820
This is Chopper. Everyone, please respond.

163
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,260
This is Luffy. There're tons
of monsters down here, over.

164
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,600
Is this a giant sea snakes' nest?

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,020
This is Sanji. Whoa! They looked this way!

166
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,980
Okay.

167
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,800
Okay?!

168
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,760
They'll survive. Don't worry!

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,620
Chopper, hold the brake tight, okay?

170
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,320
Okay!

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Phew... I'm glad I didn't go.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Salvage, salvage!

173
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,650
Hm?

174
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,310
Salvage, salvage!

175
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,700
Salvage, salvage!

176
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,070
What the heck is that?

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,400
Salvage, salvage!

178
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,640
Salvage, salvage!

179
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,920
Company, halt!

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,670
Salvage...

181
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,310
Aye, aye, sir!

182
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,200
Is this the area where a ship sank?!

183
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,670
Aye, aye, sir! Boss!

184
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,630
By boss... they mean me!

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,990
Prepare to salvage the ship!

186
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,010
The sunken ship belongs to me,
the king of salvagers

187
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,850
and the boss of the Masira Pirates!

188
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,580
Oh, boy... weirdoes at a time like this...

189
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,290
Hey, you! What're you guys
doing there?! This is my turf!

190
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,750
Your turf?

191
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,960
That's right. Every ship that sinks
in this territory belongs to me.

192
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,750
You haven't touched anything
that's mine, have you, huh?!

193
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,400
Looks like... he's going to salvage the ship.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,730
Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

195
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,290
Then what? Doesn't this work for us?

196
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,550
Quit mumbling! Answer my question!

197
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,730
Excuse me! Can I ask you a question?!

198
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,910
You're asking me a question?!
That's fine. Ask me anything!

199
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,720
It looks like you're going to
salvage the ship. Is that right?

200
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,780
Looks?

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,760
Hey... Do you find me that "monkeyful"?

202
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,110
Monkeyful?

203
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,760
That means "handsome." Do you think I am?

204
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,410
Yeah!

205
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,830
Oh, come on, stop it!

206
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,930
But there isn't such a word, is there?

207
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,610
So, are you gonna salvage it?!

208
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,400
Of course! If there's a
sunken ship in front of me,

209
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,740
I'll salvage it! I'm that kind of a man!

210
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,070
If it's on the water, I'll sink it and
salvage it! I'm that kind of a man!

211
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,030
There's no ship that we can't salvage!

212
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,150
Then... is it okay if we watch you do it?

213
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,690
Hm? Oh, I see, is salvaging work new to you?

214
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,630
Okay, go ahead and observe it!

215
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,580
Alright! Let's see how things
go for now, everyone.

216
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,110
Be... Be careful!

217
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,530
Boss! There's trouble!

218
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,290
What's wrong?!

219
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,250
The members who went into
the sea to set the cradle are...!

220
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,400
Did they get hurt by Sea Kings?

221
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,590
Well... it looks like they
were beaten up by someone.

222
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,920
What?! Are you saying there's
someone down there in the sea?

223
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,470
Those idiots...!

224
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,680
This isn't good.

225
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,890
Then... Hey, you guys!

226
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,050
Ah... well...

227
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,120
There's someone in the sea! Be careful!

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,370
Er... O-Okay!

229
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,030
Good thing he's an idiot.

230
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,950
Guys! Hurry up and set the cradle!

231
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,460
Let's start salvaging!

232
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,030
Aye, aye, sir!

233
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,370
He's waving to us... Don't let him
notice the air supply, Usopp.

234
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,900
I know!

235
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,480
Hey, you guys, imagine that they're pumpkins!

236
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,680
Don't get nervous... just because
people are watching, okay?

237
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,430
Aye, aye, sir!

238
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,530
Drop the cradle!

239
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,950
Aye, aye, sir!

240
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,500
Watch out for the mysterious enemy!

241
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,520
Aye, aye, sir!

242
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,750
I wonder if they're doing this
out of pride or something.

243
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,630
They're trying to give us a show, I guess...

244
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,150
Get moving!

245
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,610
Aye, aye, sir!

246
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,870
Hey...

247
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,240
Hm?

248
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,800
Look!

249
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,690
Cradle set, confirmed!

250
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,300
What's going on?!

251
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,560
Hm?

252
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,810
What's that monkey?! What's that monkey for?!

253
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,090
Oh, this one?

254
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,570
You have a discerning eye.

255
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,040
You're right. This is no ordinary prow.

256
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,470
Launch Barco-hunter!

257
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,020
Aye, aye, sir!

258
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,410
Whoa!

259
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,460
Wow! Amazing!

260
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,770
It's really amazing!

261
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,460
What is?

262
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,460
40 meters to the target!

263
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,950
30 meters!

264
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,410
20... 10...!

265
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,980
Barco-hunter joint... completed!

266
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,320
Alright, then! I'll start blowing air!

267
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,340
Aye, aye, sir!

268
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,320
What? No way...

269
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,140
Is he going to breathe into
that and lift the ship up?!

270
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,380
That's crazy!

271
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,720
Air?!

272
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,160
The ship's body has risen!

273
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,810
Now! Pull it up!

274
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,300
Aye, aye, sir!

275
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Send more air! On the double!

276
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,270
Aye, aye, sir!

277
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
Boss! The crew that's in the water...!

278
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,490
What's the matter?! What happened, guys?!

279
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,540
There's someone in the ship!

280
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,110
How dare they hurt my guys?!
Who the hell are they?!

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,190
Well, we're not taking
pictures or anything, so...

282
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,450
What?!

283
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,350
Oh, he posed for us to take pictures...

284
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,430
Boss! Help!

285
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,790
I'm coming! Keep on working
on the salvaging operation!

286
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,960
Aye, aye, sir!

287
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,040
Monkey punch!

288
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,030
It's coming up...

289
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,190
See? We're fine without the barrel.

290
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,470
It's amazing that they pumped in this much air.

291
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,800
But who is trying to salvage this ship?

292
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,270
Something might have happened
to Nami-san and Robin-chan.

293
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,660
I've been calling them, but no response!

294
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,440
Who the hell are you, invading my turf?!

295
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,310
Hm?

296
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,330
Oh, it's a monkey.

297
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,810
What? Am I that monkeyful?

298
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,860
Yeah, you're an imitation monkey.

299
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
What kind of conversation is that?

300
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,800
What do you mean?

301
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,860
By the way, who are you?

302
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,530
I see... What can I say?

303
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,040
Do you really think so? You have a good eye!

304
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,820
So who the hell are you?!

305
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,320
Hey, underneath the ship...

306
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,700
Y-Yeah... there's something down there.

307
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,130
I see! You guys came from the East Blue, huh?!

308
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,590
Yeah. But really, you look just like a monkey!

309
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,820
Quit complimenting me!

310
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,000
What's this?! What is this thing?!

311
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,850
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

312
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:27,910
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

313
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:43,840
There are days where I almost lose to myself

314
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,260
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

315
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,390
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

316
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:08,740
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

317
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,580
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

318
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,710
This unique moment...

319
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,630
Ahhh! It's a turtle!

320
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,680
This is the sea! Of course we'll see turtles!

321
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,350
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

322
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,080
Shut up and be quiet!

323
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,840
How can you be so calm?!

324
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,850

On the next episode of One Piece!
