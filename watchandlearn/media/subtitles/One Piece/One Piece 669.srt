The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390
We keep finding the things we

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,610
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,620
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,530
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,470
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,570
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round.

78
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,340
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,070
who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,230
Meanwhile, at the Colosseum,

81
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,980
the final round of the competition is about to start.

82
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,250
Who is that? He's not the Lucy that I knew.

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,390
This is the Rampart Tower B-2 -
in front of the main dining hall!

84
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,590
It's no mistake!
One of the intruders is Straw Hat Luffy!

85
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,900
And Pirate Hunter Zoro!

86
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,010
And... V-Violet-sama!

87
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,170
Th-There is one more person!

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,310
Lucy is showing it off!

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,750
Straw Hat Luffy has snuck in?

90
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:44,320
Then, who is the guy
fighting at the Colosseum?!

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,700
What the hell is going on?!

92
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,230
"A Moving Castle!
The Top Executive Pica Rises Up!"

93
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,150
Where's Mingo?!

94
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,550
Shoot! Shoot!

95
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,770
Are you okay, small person?!

96
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,390
Thank you!

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,070
Kin'emon, you take care of her!

98
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,760
What?

99
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,020
But I have to find the
place called the Toy House

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,830
where my friend Kanjuro is held!

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,470
I want to go there, too,
to take part in Operation SOP!

102
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,270
You do?! I didn't know that!

103
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,730
Zoro-dono, we're gonna go to
the Toy House together, then!

104
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,940
Do as you like.

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,280
Now, where is the Toy house?

106
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,200
--It's beneath this building. But...
--Oh, it's down below?

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,190
--Maybe, go down those stairs first and...
--Stairs?!

108
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh, now I know which way to go!

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,740
Get deep inside so you don't fall out again!

110
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,130
What? Oh, wait a sec...

111
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,930
Luffy-dono! Zoro-dono! Ninja Woman!

112
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll take my leave!

113
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,740
Excuse me!

114
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,460
THE ROYAL PALACE B-1 -
THE RAMPART TOWER

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,350
Straw Hat Luffy

116
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,600
has gone up to B-1 of the Rampart Tower!

117
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,930
Which way?!

118
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,010
To the left!

119
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,790
No one's here!
I'll get to you soon, Mingo!

120
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,290
Their security isn't keeping up with us!

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,980
Wh-What's this?

122
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,100
Something is in the wall.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,040
A face?!

124
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,540
What the...

125
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,640
A stone monster?!

126
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh no! It's Pica!

127
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,730
He's huge!
What's up with him?!

128
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,580
Be careful!
He's a top executive of the Family!

129
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,290
This stone monster?!

130
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,350
He's Pica, eater of the Stone-Stone Fruit -
a stone assimilation human!

131
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,990
A stone assimilation human?

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,440
He doesn't look like a human to me.

133
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,730
Are you really a human?

134
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm asking you a question!
Say something!

135
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,070
Can't you talk?!

136
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,750
If we get it in the teeth,
we'll be crushed with one blow!

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,460
Damn! We can't advance if nothing is done!

138
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,300
I don't care
if you're a top executive or something!

139
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,200
I gotta go kick Mingo's ass!

140
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,270
Get out of my way!

141
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,640
Gum-Gum...

142
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,840
...Jet Gatling!

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,630
Alright, I did it! Let's go!

144
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,280
That was too easy.

145
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,640
He's back for more!

146
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
Now you know it's not that easy to take down

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
the top executives of the Family!

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,990
He's not just a stone man.

149
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,020
He can merge with stones.
Which means he's practically...

150
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,520
...taking control of this whole stone palace!

151
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,210
The walls!

152
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,380
THE TOY HOUSE

153
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,900
Bring it on, Navy!

154
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,840
It's dangerous-in!

155
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,180
Hey, hold your fire, Navy!

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,080
How could you intrude in the
territory of the Family like this?

157
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,870
Our target is Cyborg
Franky of the Straw Hats!

158
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,930
Move aside if you don't wanna get shot!

159
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,380
You can't tell me what to do,
you stupid Navy!

160
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,180
What?!

161
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,210
--He's brushing his teeth!
--With two shoebrushes!

162
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,940
Señor is an executive of
the Don Quixote Family!

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,790
He's so strong!

164
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,130
It doesn't matter if I'm strong or weak.
It's a matter of a man's pride.

165
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,860
You tramps should stay out of it!

166
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,930
Oh! Scold us more, Señor!
We want more!

167
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,600
Whether you're an executive or not,
if you stand against the Navy, we...

168
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,850
Don't shoot him!

169
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,740
Regarding the Navy's involvement,

170
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,670
Issho-san and Doflamingo have talked

171
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,110
and come to an agreement-dara.

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,550
I don't like it but
if the Young Master is okay with it...

173
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Oh, Señor!

174
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,490
Why are you relaxing?!

175
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,620
I was super bored.

176
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,500
Now, listen to my song. "The Pirate Blues"!

177
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,870
No thanks!

178
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,440
Everybody!

179
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,310
We're going to make a full-scale charge now!

180
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:49,120
Capture or scrap Cyborg Franky
of the Straw Hats-dara!

181
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,210
Yeah!

182
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,750
I'm super ready anytime!

183
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,250
Huh?

184
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,340
--He's swimming...
--...In the ground?!

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,800
--Señor, you must be tired!
--Take a good rest!

186
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm sweating a little bit.

187
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,440
Let's see how much the Navy can do.

188
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,610
So hard-boiled!

189
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,020
I didn't expect the Navy to cut in but...

190
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,620
...it's becoming like a party and I like it!

191
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Weapons Left!

192
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,050
And...

193
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,410
...Franky...

194
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,210
...Rocket Launcher!

195
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,210
Don't hold back! Keep shooting!

196
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,090
Ha! That fool.

197
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,970
He's facing that many soldiers alone
but he doesn't budge an inch.

198
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,960
I like his gutsiness.

199
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,930
--Use the new cannon-dara!
--Yes, sir!

200
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,970
What kind of cannon is that?
It sounds exciting!

201
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,200
Fire!

202
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,510
Cyborg Franky is on fire!

203
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,890
We did it!

204
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,040
We did it!

205
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,540
Even his steel body can't
take that much heat!

206
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,730
He's gonna get all melted up!

207
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm... dying...

208
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,320
Or not!

209
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,030
What?!

210
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,930
You think I'm that weak?!

211
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,600
Did you think you could kill me
with those crappy toys?!

212
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,520
Super!

213
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,040
Dammit!

214
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,220
Oops!

215
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,270
What should I use this time?

216
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,710
Give me just about three seconds.

217
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,740
This?

218
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,490
No.

219
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,760
Not this one either.

220
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,730
This is it after all!

221
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,630
He's playing with us!

222
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,340
I'm not gonna run or hide!
So...

223
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,570
Let's have a big party, Navy!

224
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,840
Shoot-dara!

225
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,790
THE CURRENT LOCATION

226
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,690
THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT
USOPP AND THE OTHERS

227
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,820
Toys are coming out of there
one after another!

228
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,390
It means Sugar is there in the
Executive Tower at this moment.

229
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,160
What are those tentacle-like things?

230
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,740
There's an exclusive lift for
the executives in the middle.

231
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,390
And those pipes stretching on all side

232
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,670
s are for Big Humans and broken toys to fall.

233
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,690
There are chutes to the junkyard
coming from everywhere in Dressrosa.

234
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,950
When someone gets dropped from there,

235
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,750
he'll fall to the junkyard beneath the Executive Tower.

236
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,380
Help!

237
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,410
Damn! It's horrible!
First, it was the piles of trash - now what?

238
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,250
Where am I?!

239
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,240
You're a pirate - Cavendish, aren't you?

240
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,470
--Yes, I am...
--We're gonna have to examine you.

241
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,980
Examine me?! I'm totally healthy...

242
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,360
What the hell?! What's going on?!

243
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,270
What the hell is going on?!

244
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,470
And what is this slimy stuff?

245
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,550
I thought it was strange when
they took me to the medic room

246
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,140
even though I wasn't injured!

247
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,080
It's not "slimy," it's "sticky"!

248
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,780
What? Wow, you're too close!
Who the hell are you?!

249
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,500
You're in the Executive Tower.

250
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,940
INSIDE THE EXECUTIVE TOWER

251
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,720
But for some reason, new toys

252
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,040
keep coming out of here.

253
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,160
This factory-like room has...

254
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,030
...a special name besides
the "Executive Tower."

255
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,830
Sugar, what's the other name?

256
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,610
The Executive Tower.

257
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,560
No!

258
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,390
Snot comes out! It's hanging!

259
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,780
Yuck. Drop dead.

260
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,860
No, I'm not gonna die!

261
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,570
TREBOL - A TOP EXECUTIVE OF THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY
(THE STICKY-STICKY FRUIT EATER)

262
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,580
I'm not gonna listen to a brat like you!

263
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,890
Hey, I'm stuck, kid!

264
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,460
Do something about this sticky fluid...

265
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,650
What?

266
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,480
Here is the contract.

267
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,580
Do not harm any human.

268
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,210
Follow any orders from the Family.

269
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,830
What are you talking about?

270
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,150
Hey! What happened to my body?!
Change me back...

271
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,090
Stop talking and just go work!

272
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,510
What?! I can't talk!

273
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,790
Why am I doing as he says?!

274
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,360
Follow any orders from the Family.

275
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,230
The contract?!

276
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,320
Nobody remembers you now!

277
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,570
I even forget who you were!

278
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,070
You're gonna work and fight for Doffy
for the rest of your life!

279
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,800
Hey, what's going on?!
I've become a toy!

280
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,450
If you walk out the door at
the very end, there is a port!

281
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,600
Oh, you're a newcomer?
Let me take you to your position.

282
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,620
Where am I?!

283
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,100
Keep moving!

284
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,020
This is it! Now, work!

285
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,530
I'm a pirate!

286
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,020
This must be a bad dream! I wanna wake up!

287
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,560
Just carry it!

288
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,930
No! I don't wanna work!
Along with these creepy moving toys!

289
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,570
I'm not gonna work here
for the rest of my life!

290
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,880
So this is where they export the weapons!
But I can't disobey them!

291
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,440
I can't do anything!

292
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,260
I can't believe there is
such a port underground!

293
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,070
I wish I could make a call!

294
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,700
Koala is waiting for my call!

295
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,120
Is there any way I can move on my own will?!

296
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,230
I'm the king of Prodence!
Damn Doflamingo!

297
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,390
Live as a toy for the rest of my life?
No way! Somebody, help!

298
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,450
Swift!

299
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,140
That must be Trebol and Sugar.

300
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,860
She really looks like a kid.

301
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,770
Yes, she does.

302
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,840
She loves grapes - she's always eating them.

303
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,220
--So what?
--We're gonna use that against her.

304
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,090
Take a look at this!

305
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,920
This is a clump of Tatababasco Sauce,
the hottest spice in the world!

306
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,280
We made it look like a grape.

307
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,530
Don't tell me you're gonna let her eat it?!

308
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,500
I'm gonna go and put this in to the basket!

309
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,300
We tested it on 50 people of our tribe and...

310
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,480
...all of them got knocked out
and 18 of them almost died!

311
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,080
You tested it?!

312
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,680
We left nothing to chance!
I'm gonna make her eat it!

313
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,420
Alright! Leo, go!
I'm gonna be watching you!

314
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,090
That's so encouraging!

315
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,460
I gotta be able to get away
if something goes wrong.

316
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,700
Good luck, Leo!

317
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,400
You guys are too loud!

318
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,800
--Watch out for Trebol!
--Watch out!

319
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,740
I said you are too loud!

320
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,020
I can do this!

321
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,340
You all have to get ready!

322
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
When you hear Sugar scream,

323
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,750
that's when all the toys in the country will

324
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,880
change back into their human forms!

325
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,500
And at the same time,
everybody will get their lost memories back!

326
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,790
All his evildoing will be revealed

327
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,350
and the pirate - Doflamingo - will...

328
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,260
...show his true color!

329
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,990
I'm gonna go now!
Let's save all our friends!

330
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,940
Guys! You're too loud!

331
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,040
We will take back King Riku's kingdom!

332
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,640
I said...

333
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,650
...you're being too loud!
