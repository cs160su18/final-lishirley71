00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,480
Vice Admiral! He's not around!

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:27,200
"Justice"

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,820
"He's not around!" doesn't cut it!

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,940
Where the hell did he go?!

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,310
Since his bicycle is gone,
he probably went to... sea.

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,150
Contact the Five Elder Stars immediately!

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, sir!

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,080
Oops. Sorry about that.

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,000
That man again? He probably
just went to do some sightseeing.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,010
Seriously... Doesn't he realize his position?

33
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,060
We can't just have him wandering about.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,030
One of the Navy Headquarters'
ultimate powerhouses, Admiral Aokiji...

35
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,950
At any rate, there's not a single
good egg in this guy's family...

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:18,210
"Proud Man! Silver Fox Foxy"

37
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,090
Hey, Captain! Stop fooling around!
Help me out here!

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,620
Whoa! What a huge wave! It's scary!

39
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,550
He sure looks like he's having fun.

40
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,020
Tell me about it. I bet he'll be laughing
even if the ship gets capsized.

41
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,390
Wouldn't this thing snap before that happens?

42
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,870
Really?! If that happens,
what's gonna happen to us?!

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,730
Don't worry.

44
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,440
Even if the mast gets broken,
it doesn't mean the ship will sink.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,770
Besides, we have an excellent,
cute navigator on this ship.

46
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,540
Oh, no! It looks like the mast is about to break!

47
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,350
Really? What's gonna happen to us?

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,310
Don't worry!

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Even if the mast gets broken,
it doesn't mean the ship will sink!

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,390
Ah...

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,020
Ahoy! Guys! Long time no see, huh?

52
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,350
Boss! That's Straw Hat!

53
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,930
Ahoy!

54
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,390
How dare you, Straw Hat?! Don't look this way!

55
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,560
We haven't fallen so low as to need your help!

56
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,990
What?!

57
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,000
See ya!

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,790
Hey! If you want to help us,
we're okay with that, you know!

59
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,680
Boss... look behind you...

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,180
This is nothing! Slow-Slow Beam!

61
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,270
Beam!

62
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,730
This is it for us!

63
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,140
Hey, isn't this bad?

64
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,980
A small boat like that won't stand a chance.

65
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,660
Guys! Stay back!

66
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,240
Hold on to this!

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,170
Idiot! No! I meant the rope!

68
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,280
Luffy!

69
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,060
Well, I feel ashamed.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,360
First, I lost 500 subordinates.

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,820
And now, to think I even lost my ship...

72
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,210
This is finally the end of Silver Fox Foxy...

73
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,040
It might've been better if I'd let fate
take its course and sank into the sea.

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,420
Boss...

75
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,250
What do you think about that?

76
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,250
Well, I may not be in a position
to say this, but that's a lie.

77
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,720
Therefore, I'd like you to take pity
on me and let me stay on this ship!

78
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Okay. Since you don't have
your own ship, it can't be helped.

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,480
Here's some soup. It'll warm you up.

80
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,410
Whoa! This looks good! I'll have it with Choppy.

81
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,730
Sanji! I wanna have some, too!

82
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,620
There isn't any left. Wait until tomorrow.

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,780
What's wrong? Don't hold back.

84
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,050
What's this?! There's nothing in the soup!

85
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't act so full of yourself!

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,830
--Ahh! Sanji!
--How about I put you in the soup?!

87
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,580
Hey! Calm down! Calm down, Sanji!

88
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,750
You too! Apologize to Sanji! Okay?! Okay?!

89
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,770
Huh?!

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,690
Oh, no! What's this?! This is amazing!

91
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,730
Lots of gold... I didn't know they were rich.

92
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,650
Oh, shoot. The soup will get cold.

93
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,580
Choppy! You're here, right?

94
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,740
Choppy!

95
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,620
Oh...

96
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,540
It was just a candleholder...

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,730
Hm? Where's Boss?

98
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,970
Ahhh!

99
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,440
Choppy!

100
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,200
As if I'm gonna sit around fishing. I'm a guest.

101
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,410
Besides, we have food right here, too!

102
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,220
He's an idiot.

103
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,590
That's...

104
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,660
Boss! I see the Sexy Foxy!

105
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,550
What?!

106
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,670
--Ahoy! Ahoy!
--Good! You guys're gonna get off our ship, huh?

107
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,420
--Ahoy!
--Are they leaving the ship?!

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,560
--Ahoy! Ahoy!
--Hurray! Hurray!

109
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,180
Sodium...

110
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,570
Hydrogen phosphate.

111
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,310
What are those guys doing?

112
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,460
They've already gone to their ship.

113
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,090
Guys... You all couldn't forget about Boss
even after we got separated, huh?

114
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,870
I see, I see...

115
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,090
You can all come back to the Foxy Pirates.

116
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,920
What's the matter, you guys?

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,100
Let's have fun together again!

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,150
That's not possible, Foxy-san.

119
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,150
What'd you say?! Who the hell are you?!

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,060
This ship is now under the control
of the Fang-Frog Pirates!

121
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,620
Those guys are now my underlings!

122
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,700
Fang-Frog? Who's that?

123
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,450
Ah... If I remember right, they're the ones

124
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,240
who lost in the Davy Back Fight
and had stuff taken away.

125
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,290
And this time, Foxy got
his ship taken over by them?

126
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,050
What a stupid guy that Split-Head is.

127
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,720
Well, it is a motley crew of pirates
won by playing games, after all.

128
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,300
I think I'll pass on the send-off.

129
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Hey, let's go. We've got no business here.

130
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,150
Hold it!

131
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,650
I've got some business with you.

132
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,930
My underlings still won't
take off those strange masks.

133
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,160
It's quite annoying, but it seems they're
still devoted to their former captain.

134
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,630
It's probably because they
don't like their new captain.

135
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,990
Whoa! Boss is kinda cool.

136
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,460
For a split-head.

137
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Like it or not, small fries
follow the strong after all.

138
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,350
If they see you get beaten up,
they'll probably come to their senses.

139
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,270
Fight me, Silver Fox Foxy!

140
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,190
How conceited... You think you can defeat me?!

141
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
Looks like he'll accept.

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,920
Hey, Split-Head is on fire!
Come check it out already!

143
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,940
His head...

144
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,950
...is on fire?

145
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,070
Boss...

146
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,630
What's the matter, Porche, Hamburg?
Show some happiness.

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,550
He's gonna give this ship
and my subordinates back to me.

148
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,010
We Foxy Pirates challenge you
Fang-Frog Pirates to a Davy Back Fight!

149
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,980
I'll teach you who the real captain is!

150
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,570
You said you'd beat me up, huh?

151
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,960
If it's duels you want, why don't
we start with us captains?!

152
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,420
I assume you have no objection?

153
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,870
Boss is quite confident, isn't he?

154
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,790
He's got that stuff, so...

155
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,120
Is he gonna use that?

156
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,680
Well, what else would he do?

157
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,730
Here I come! Slow-Slow Beam!

158
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,150
Whaaa...

159
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,650
...aaat?!

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,570
Guys! Take him down!

161
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,490
That beam of yours is no
threat at all once I reflect it!

162
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,910
I already know your trick.

163
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,460
Boss!

164
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,740
Hey! What're you doing?!

165
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,750
Stop right there!

166
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,180
Drop your weapon!

167
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,220
Damn... it...!

168
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,830
Guys, did you see how stupid
your former boss looked?

169
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,410
You don't have to be loyal
to a guy like that! Got that?!

170
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,920
Hey, you! Wasn't it supposed
to be a duel?! That's dirty!

171
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,530
You're an outsider, so shut up!

172
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,340
To start with, I never said that
I'd accept the Davy Back Fight.

173
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,670
That bastard...!

174
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,630
Don't. It's their fight.

175
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,110
It has nothing to do with you.

176
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,190
He's right.

177
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,200
Just shut up and watch, Straw Hat...

178
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,980
Watch the proud Silver Fox Foxy fight!

179
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,080
Ah! What the hell is that?!

180
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,110
The fox guy is gone.

181
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,040
Where did he go?!

182
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,880
That way! I saw him go that way! It's true!

183
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,590
Oh, that way, huh?!

184
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,050
You think we'd fall for that?!

185
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,540
I wonder if they're having a party or something.

186
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,140
Maybe I'll go check it out.

187
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh, so, you'd rather have that girl
chasing you than stay with me, Doctor?

188
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,940
Okay, it's your turn, Robin.

189
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,330
One roasted fox, coming up!

190
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,080
Boss...

191
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,890
Boss!

192
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,880
Get back here! I'm your boss!

193
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,090
Hey...

194
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,690
Aren't weapons something
you use against your enemy?

195
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,480
Why do you hurt your own subordinate?!

196
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,650
Hm?

197
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,230
If you rely only on power, you're nothing
but the head of a group of thugs.

198
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,070
You don't have the caliber
to be the captain of a ship.

199
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,250
Just give up on this ship
and my subordinates as well.

200
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,550
I won't give you anything-- not a single thing.

201
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,550
Shut up!

202
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,810
Boss!

203
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,690
Hey, Split-Head!

204
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,530
Hang in there!

205
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,700
Hey!

206
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,330
Oh... It's you, Straw Hat...

207
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,770
I guess that was pretty pathetic, huh?

208
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,300
Say... would you do me a favor?

209
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,670
This...

210
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,440
Would you take this...?

211
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:01,480
That match was the best stage of my entire life.

212
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,610
Hey... that's...

213
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,700
You're super groovy right now!

214
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm your opponent!

215
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,130
Now, bring it on, Fang-Frog Pirates!

216
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,590
Afro!

217
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,080
Hey, hey, this has nothing to do with you.

218
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,670
--It does!
--I don't wanna fight a guy with a
100-million-Berry bounty on his head.

219
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,470
What good will it do me to fight you?

220
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,130
What're you saying?

221
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,570
If you defeat the Straw Hats,
you'll get the 160-million-Berry bounty.

222
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,350
And, that's not all.

223
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,530
They have a mountain of gold on their ship.

224
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,540
I bet that's worth quite a bit.

225
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,700
Yep, yep.

226
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,960
Are you shocked?! Just take it, you thieves!

227
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,530
Geez... When did they...?

228
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,720
Why is he talking proudly about it?

229
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,550
I'd better check later to
make sure nothing is missing.

230
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,040
A-A mountain of gold...

231
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,890
Seriously...?

232
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,890
Prepare to fire! The target is Straw Hat!

233
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,700
Yeah!

234
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
Fire!

235
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,250
--Let's go join him!
--Yeah!

236
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,580
What're you gonna do?

237
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,280
Hey!

238
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,880
Just hand over the gold nice and...

239
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,800
I guess this won't be settled unless
we take them all out, huh? Good grief...

240
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,390
Ha! We've got 500 crew members!

241
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,290
Take him down!

242
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,000
We weren't listening!

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,890
Hey!

244
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,020
Too bad they weren't listening, huh?

245
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,610
Hey, look at that!

246
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,560
Hm?

247
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,520
Ah! Hold it!

248
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,830
So, how is it, Fang-Frog?
My brother is strong, isn't he?

249
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,230
After all, he's so strong--

250
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,320
that you can't find anyone besides me--
who can defeat him.

251
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,590
You guys, go easy on them--
you don't wanna kill them.

252
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,300
They're just ordinary humans.

253
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,380
Take this!

254
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,130
Sword... Catch...!

255
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,520
What're you doing, you damn cook?!

256
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,020
You bastard! You pushed Nami-san
down earlier, didn't you?!

257
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,230
I did it to save her! Got a problem with that?!

258
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,810
What're you gonna do if she gets
seriously injured, you idiot?!

259
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,820
To start with, you don't know how to treat ladi...

260
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,480
Sword...

261
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,660
Like I said, what's your problem, you bastard?!

262
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,330
Shut up! We weren't done yet, were we?!

263
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,280
What's the deal? Wanna fight?!

264
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,630
Out of the way!

265
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,920
Oh... a human firework.

266
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,470
Looks like they're in full swing.

267
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,680
My chronic abdominal spasms...

268
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,480
H-Hey, are you oka--?

269
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,320
You got tricked, young fellow.

270
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, no. This is bad. I'm a doctor.
Let me take a look.

271
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,990
I hate doctors!

272
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,890
That was Ketchup Star.

273
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,240
Ow, ow, ow... My back...

274
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,340
Hey, pull yourse--

275
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,050
Ouch!

276
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,460
Gum-Gum...

277
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,600
Ouch!

278
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,220
...Whip!

279
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,190
Gum-Gum...

280
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,240
...Pistol!

281
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,080
That was splendid, Straw Hat.

282
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,510
You're as marvelous as ever.

283
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,930
I was just pulled in by your passion.

284
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,890
Let me tell you just one thing.

285
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,610
Oh, stop it. We're friends.
You don't have to thank me.

286
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,790
Slow-Slow Beam!

287
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,410
Huh?!

288
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,940
That's our Boss!

289
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,750
Remember this good, Straw Hat!

290
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,430
I am Silver Fox Foxy, a man
who obtains whatever he wants.

291
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,550
Your luck ran out when you
got on this ship, you fool.

292
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,070
Just clearing up the humiliation of
the Davy Back Fight wouldn't satisfy me.

293
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,280
I'll take the 160 million Berries
along with the gold.

294
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,490
You... idiot...!

295
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,120
All right!

296
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,320
This time for sure, I'll show you

297
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,840
that we, the Foxy Pirates,
are the strongest pirates!

298
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

299
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

300
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

301
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

302
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

303
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

304
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

305
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

306
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

307
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

308
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

309
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

310
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

311
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

312
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

313
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

314
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

315
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,260
Zoro! You put the afro on, too!

316
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,760
That's right! Fire up your brotherly soul!

317
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,550
Stop it!

318
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,680
The moss-head man looks cool!

319
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,680
--Black moss-head.
--I'm gonna cut you down, you jerks!

320
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,850
His wildness awakened!

321
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,270
Geez... Like I said, what's with this afro stuff?

322
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,310
--You put it on, too, Nami!
