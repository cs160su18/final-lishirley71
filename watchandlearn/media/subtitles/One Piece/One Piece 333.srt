2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,610
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,150
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,900
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,490
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,430
The words "given up" sound so lame...

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,060
They don't suit you, Captain!

49
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,730
You're the man who's supposed
to become the King of the Pirates!

50
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,280
The idiot...! All for me, everyone is...

51
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:53,500
"The Phoenix Returns! The Dream
Sworn to Friends on a Jolly Roger"

52
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,680
Hurry! We've gotta get our flag back!

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,510
You can count on me! It was around this floor!

54
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,930
Sweet!

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,980
"Around" this floor?

56
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,230
That doesn't bode well...

57
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,820
Huh? Where is this?

58
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,660
Which room is it in, Zoro?

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,530
Don't rush me.

60
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,000
How could I not?! Luffy's on his way!

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,120
It's this one!

62
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,210
Put 'em up, you sauna freak!

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,340
--He's this way!
--Got it!

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,100
--That way!
--Got it!

65
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,070
Oh! They found some high-end flour.

66
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,110
It figures!

67
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,070
Maybe it was the next floor up.

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,650
I can't trust you!

69
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,120
If you don't remember, come out and say so!

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,870
See anything to point us in the right direction?

71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,540
At this rate, it'll be dark before we find it.

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,040
I know! We've gotta find the flag
and fast! If Luffy finds out about this...

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,540
Hey! Give back my flag!

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,170
L-Luffy!

75
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,260
Welcome to Lovely Land.

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,390
I never expected the 300-million
bounty to come on his own.

77
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,900
Huh? This is Lovely Land?

78
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,480
Sure is!

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,980
It's a weird house.

80
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,740
H-He's here!

81
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,160
It's Luffy! W-We're doomed!

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,950
We've hit the worst-case scenario!

83
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,910
This really stinks...

84
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,660
Tsk!

85
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,790
Hey! Where are you going?

86
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,790
Isn't it obvious?

87
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll use sheer willpower to get
the Jolly Roger back if I have to!

88
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,630
Go wander these halls forever!

89
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,800
Shut up, you stupid cook!

90
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,880
Robin!

91
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,550
Robin-chan!

92
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,510
I've been searching for you.

93
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,850
You're such a naughty girl, sending us
a care package with cola inside!

94
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,100
That's my Robin-chan!

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,070
But isn't it strange?
Only you got the red carpet!

96
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,480
How'd you pull that off?

97
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,650
It looks like Luffy is here.

98
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,910
He's come for our Jolly Roger.

99
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,240
That's right! We're finished!

100
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,040
No! We can still make it!

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,500
This is Luffy we're talking about!

102
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,960
We can still weasel our way through this.

103
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,840
--Got it!
--You've got a point!

104
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Yep. Whoa, wait!

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,550
Indeed. I don't know how
Luffy learned about the flag,

106
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,970
but it's not as though he
witnessed it getting stolen.

107
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,430
Yep! Which means we've still got a chance!

108
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,100
I know where the Jolly Roger is.

109
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,690
You can leave it to me.

110
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,690
Sweet!

111
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,110
Way to go, Robin!

112
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,730
You're far more reliable
than that lame moss head.

113
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
Sheesh, damn that...!

114
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,900
We're counting on you, Robin!

115
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,370
Now, then...!

116
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,750
Guys, I want you to hear me out. Listen up.

117
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,290
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

118
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,380
Magnetic Love Bazooka!

119
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,720
And Lovely Cross Attack!

120
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,440
Plus Hunter of Love Kick!

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
With our forces combined,
no one stands a chance against us.

122
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,000
The magnetic power that binds us...

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
...is love!

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,330
People call us the Hunters of Love!

125
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,340
Dammit! Your clone technique
really comes in handy.

126
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,710
We told you, we're twins!

127
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,470
How'd you learn that ability?

128
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,930
Listen to us!

129
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,180
Love Attack!

130
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,020
Gum-Gum...

131
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,770
Magnetic Love Bazooka and...

132
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,440
...Lovely Double Attack!

133
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,490
If my brothers have brotherly love,

134
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,080
then we're tightly bound
together with matrimonial love!

135
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
We sure are, Arbell!

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,580
Kissy!

137
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,750
Huh?

138
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,540
What's with these guys?

139
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,960
Luffy, are you all right?

140
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,710
It's not like I'm hungry or anything.

141
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,970
Doctor, here he comes!

142
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,970
Don't think you can escape, 50-Berry Pet!

143
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,570
I'm putting you on ice!

144
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,700
I was born and raised on a winter island!

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,660
This doesn't bug me in the least!

146
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,750
Okay! You may be hunky dory, but it seems
to be taking a heavy toll on that brat!

147
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,160
Jiro!

148
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,470
Ouch!

149
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,340
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

150
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,090
Youch, that hurt!

151
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,180
Darn it, Straw Hat! Keep outta this!

152
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,310
Huh? Did I hit you? Sorry, my bad.

153
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,770
Don't play dumb!

154
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm not playing any games.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,150
Chopper and Jiro are strong enough
that they don't need my help!

156
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,900
What?!

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,820
Luffy...

158
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,700
Doctor!

159
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,910
I'm going to stand and fight.

160
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,960
I'm going to fight on my own
and reclaim our Jolly Roger!

161
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,880
Well said, Jiro!

162
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,880
What're you talking about?

163
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
You're just a measly
50-Berry reindeer and a brat!

164
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,720
Rumble...

165
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,510
What's that...?

166
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,940
Guard Point!

167
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,110
Wh-What the heck?

168
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,110
Here I go!

169
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,440
Doctor...

170
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,650
You're incredible!

171
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,460
Guard Point is a fur-strengthening form!

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,920
I could barely even feel that attack!

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,170
Damn it! I'm gonna freeze you alive!

174
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,090
I won't let you!

175
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,760
Multi-shot Ice Puck!

176
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,470
Take that and that and that!

177
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,100
Oomph!

178
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,280
What the heck?!

179
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,200
Gah! Stop that!

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,740
What the blazes are you?!

181
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,630
We did it, Doctor!

182
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,930
Yeah! You were a big help, Jiro.

183
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,770
D-D-Damn it! N-Now that it's come to this...!

184
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,450
What's that?

185
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,880
Savage Penguins?

186
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,140
Even amongst the nasty Savage Penguins,
this colony is especially ravenous.

187
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,940
He's right! All they keep
saying is, "I'm hungry!"

188
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Wait. Doctor, you can speak Penguin?
That's awesome!

189
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,820
Stupid! I'm not happy about getting
complimented over something like that!

190
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
My three minutes are up!

191
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Jiro!

192
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,330
Jiro! Come back! Hurry!

193
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,460
No! I'm not going back until I reclaim our flag!

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The 100-million-Berry bounty's here.

195
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,390
He's pitting us against penguins?!
He's mocking us!

196
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,560
Don't let your guard down!

197
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,600
Jiro...

198
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,520
All he's got is a stick... He's being reckless!

199
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,860
Isn't he the spitting image of
how you were back in the day?

200
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,660
And despite that, Vigaro never once barked
a word of protest against your orders.

201
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,250
Hey, Vigaro! Why aren't you stopping him?

202
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:40,090
The pirates we've fought are nothing
compared to the guys on that ocean.

203
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,460
The captain is being too reckless!

204
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,590
I don't plan on stopping Puzzle.

205
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,470
What?!

206
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,760
Stansen, when we set sail
as the Phoenix Pirates,

207
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,480
didn't we decide to push forward,
no matter how strong the foe?

208
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,900
--But...
--And we're talking about the only
man I've ever considered my captain...

209
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,320
Puzzle.

210
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,530
I wouldn't regret dying if it were
to help him realize his ambitions.

211
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,370
Here's the thing about phoenixes:

212
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,450
No matter the hardship,
they always rise back up!

213
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,710
And they're reborn even stronger than before!

214
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,130
That's the type of man I've
placed my trust in with Puzzle!

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,170
Puzzle, I believe in you.

216
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,890
You are the man who will
become the King of the Pirates!

217
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,270
Gum-Gum...

218
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,600
...Whip!

219
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,480
Beat it!

220
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,700
I...

221
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,330
This is our flag!

222
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,960
Someday I'm going to become
the King of the Pirates.

223
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,840
We can make it to the New World!

224
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,810
Sorry, men! I was a foolish
captain who couldn't live up

225
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,560
to the trust my precious friend placed in me.

226
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,310
But... But I wanna let...

227
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,650
...Vigaro see it once more!

228
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,320
He has to see our flag flying
above the ocean where he's at rest!

229
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,780
Captain!

230
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,330
Jiro, let's go! We're getting our flag back.

231
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,420
Captain...!

232
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,000
Aye aye, sir!

233
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,980
Why, you...!

234
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,410
Straw Hat! We'll deal with these scumballs!

235
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,040
Yeah? Then please do!

236
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,540
Hey!

237
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,010
--Hey, guys!
--You damn doting couple!

238
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,890
Yeah, you! I'm talking to you,
the stupid doting couple!

239
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,270
Constantly letching over a
lady is outright pathetic...

240
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,350
...you stinking hound of a man!

241
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,150
What's with those two, Darling?

242
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,900
They're simmering with jealousy.

243
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,200
--Talk about idiots!
--Aren't they stupid?

244
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,320
Kissy!

245
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,870
Hey, you jerk!

246
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,700
--I won't forgive you!
--Sanji!

247
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,580
Jerks! You let our precious Jolly Roger--

248
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,910
Where'd you go, you hockey freak?!

249
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,080
Right here!

250
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,790
Don't expect a repeat of last time!

251
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,090
Let's go! C'mon!

252
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,760
Let's go! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

253
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,510
--Get your butt in gear, Usopp!
--Coming!

254
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,140
La la-la la!

255
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,850
Jerk! Wait for me!

256
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,140
Say your prayers!

257
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,890
Hold up, you stupid doting couple!

258
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,520
Hey, Usopp! Our Jolly Roger--

259
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,900
Luffy! We have to defeat all of
these guys before we can go inside!

260
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,230
Why is that, Usopp?

261
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,700
Well, you see...

262
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,320
Listen up! Gloss over Luffy's
questions about the flag

263
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,080
until Robin gets it back! Understood?

264
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,540
Roger!

265
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,420
Uh, w-well...

266
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,340
There is a spell cast on that door

267
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,250
so that it won't open until we
defeat all five baddies here!

268
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,180
--A spell?
--Y-Yeah.

269
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,760
Really? So that's the deal.

270
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,470
I'll kick their butts!

271
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,280
Big Sister Robin, what were you up to?

272
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,940
Pretending to be an adventurer all by yourself?

273
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,660
No. I wanted to go see your Papa's room.

274
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,620
Really? You wanted to see Papa?

275
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,790
You can get to Papa's room
through this greenhouse.

276
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,620
It's a shortcut, plus it's fun!

277
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,800
Big Sister Robin, don't you like flowers?

278
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,340
Yes.

279
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,970
Big Sister Arbell loved this room, too!

280
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,510
We'd always go on walks here together...

281
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,560
But then she got married to that gross creep...

282
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,440
Hey, let's play that game!

283
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,190
You know? The one where I guess
which hand the coin is in.

284
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,690
Let's play! Let's play!

285
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,450
Lil...

286
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,870
Why did you lie to me?

287
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,750
I suspect this greenhouse doesn't
lead to your Papa's room.

288
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,250
Am I right?

289
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,880
Big Sister Robin, you lied to me, too.

290
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,760
You promised to play with me,

291
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,340
but you plan on leaving
with your friends, don't you?

292
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,390
But there is no way you'll
ever escape from this place.

293
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,770
What is this?!

295
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,570
Promise to become my big sister.

296
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,160
Do and I'll save you.

297
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,540
Damn that ugly man!

298
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,620
I won't fall for the same trick twice.

299
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh, really?

300
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,380
Arbell-chan, you're so hot!

301
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,840
You instantly fell for the exact same trick!

302
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,090
Here I go!

303
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,850
Now that I think about it, you can
handle him on your own, huh?

304
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,350
You bet!

305
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,930
Multi-shot!

306
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,350
Fresh Fire!

307
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,850
Foul...

308
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,070
Gum-Gum...

309
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,900
...Gatling!

310
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,910
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,210
It's refreshing when my moves hit home!

312
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,960
The door's open...

313
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,630
Blend!

314
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,420
You're finished, Campaccino!

315
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,640
You siblings use magnetism as your weapon.

316
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,760
You can't use that power if you're apart!

317
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,640
That isn't my only power.

318
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,810
What?!

319
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,320
--Love Swing!
--I'll catch you!

320
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,240
Are you stupid?!

321
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,490
What's that moron Sanji thinking?!

322
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,120
Usopp, the door opened!

323
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,960
Ah, got it!

324
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,880
Crap! Now what'll we do?!

325
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,550
What are you guys doing?!

326
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,010
Whoo, Nami-san!

327
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Sanji-kun, you deal with that man!

328
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,390
Leave him to me!

329
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,890
I'll take down this woman.

330
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,520
Thunder Charge!

331
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,690
My, what a thing to say!

332
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,820
What's your basis to support that claim?

333
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,780
"Basis"? We're running short on time!

334
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,950
Thunder Ball!

335
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,490
Luffy's going to catch on! Thunderbolt Tempo!

336
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,750
Honey!

337
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,130
Didn't you hear her? We're short on time.

338
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,760
Basses Côte!

339
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,220
Longe!

340
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Tendron!

341
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,680
Flanchet! Quasi! Jarret!

342
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,260
Curly Cook's merciless, isn't he?

343
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,100
Ignore him. He's stupid that way.

344
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,820
Wh-What's with him?!

345
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,790
Do-Don Accino!

346
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,380
He's... naked!

347
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,330
That's the issue?

348
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:47,760
Straw Hat, how dare you beat up
my darling sons and daughter?!

349
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,520
You've made a fool of the Accino Family!

350
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,980
So you're the one who stole
our Jolly Roger, Naked Balloon!

351
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,570
Hmph! So what if I did, whippersnapper?

352
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm gonna kick your butt right
quick and get our flag back!

353
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,380
Naked Balloon, quit saying,
"Bushuuu, bushuuu!"

354
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,140
Luffy, be careful! It looks
like he can still grow hotter!

355
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,350
I've gotta hurry and defeat him
so we can get our Jolly Roger back.

356
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,430
Oh, right. Nami, what on earth were--

357
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,470
Crap! Guys, hurry!

358
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,440
We really gotta beat Luffy to the flag!

359
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,270
"The Super Hot-Hot Final Battle!
Luffy vs. the Scorching Hot Don"

361
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,690
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
