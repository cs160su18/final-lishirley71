2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,310
--Who are you?
--What?

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,560
Oh? Who the heck are they?

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,860
Are they also your subordinates, Captain Usopp?

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,030
Hm?! Y-Yeah, of course!

27
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,320
You guys lost your memories, too?

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,820
Hi, pretty ladies! Your names, please?

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,530
What the heck is that?

30
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,410
It's a deer.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,000
Shut up, human! I'm a reindeer!

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
It talked!

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Pirates this, pirates that! What a stupid era!

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,840
I hate pirates! What I like
are money and tangerines!

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,010
There's no way that I'd
be traveling with pirates!

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,680
You guys're making quite a
racket so early in the morning.

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,140
You're interrupting my morning nap.

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,150
I have to get out of here somehow.

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,570
I've got no idea what's going on,

40
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,990
but it seems like there's
no point in me staying here.

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:11,960
"A Mysterious Boy with a Horn
and Robin's Deduction!"

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,050
Navigator...

43
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,720
Now I can rest easy for a while.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm glad that unpleasant pirate
hunter is off the ship, but...

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,970
I have a feeling that Navigator
might set foot on the island.

46
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,350
Knowing her, she probably won't do too much

47
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,230
until she can make a level-headed decision.

48
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,820
I hope so.

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,280
Hey, I'm starving. I wanna eat!

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,570
You look tasty!

51
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,620
What?!

52
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,240
Geez... You have no sense of tension, do you?

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,830
Hm?

54
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,500
But, well, I guess we can think about
what to do after we finish eating, huh?

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,130
By the way, Miss, I didn't get your name yet.

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm Nico Robin.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,470
First, could you tell us about
the memories that we lost?

58
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,180
Sure.

59
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,650
No way that I'd stay in a place
like that for even a second!

60
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,320
Pirates cold-bloodedly steal
things that people cherish!

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,990
I have to come up with a way to
return to Cocoyashi Village quickly.

62
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,340
I'm glad... that you came, lady.

63
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,300
I welcome you.

64
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,230
It's awfully quiet here.

65
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,600
I wonder if something happened...

66
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,900
I wonder if I'll find something
if I go up a bit higher...

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,960
Hm?

68
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,370
Newspaper...

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,880
Wh-What?!

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,550
H-Hey, wait!

71
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,220
This is mine!

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,560
Shut up! This newspaper is
the only thing I can depend on!

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,980
I'm not gonna let you have it!

74
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,440
You bastard! Stop screwing with me!

75
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,810
Why would I give you something to go on?!

76
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,270
Shut up! It's mine!

77
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,730
I got it first!

78
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,940
--Who cares?!
--Hey, who are you?!

79
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,660
If I knew, I wouldn't be having this problem!

80
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,700
What's with these people?

81
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,420
What the heck is going on?

82
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,290
--Hey...
--Hm?

83
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,670
What's the matter, lady?

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,810
I see... So you're looking for a boat?

85
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,770
--Yeah.
--The boats docked at this harbor
are the only boats on this island.

86
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,980
What? Is that right?

87
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,610
They all seem to be in disrepair, as if
they haven't been used in a long time.

88
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,190
It seems that everyone is too busy
with other things to care about them.

89
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,860
If you don't believe me, go ahead
and go around the island.

90
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,450
It's a small island. It won't take long.

91
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,460
Well, take it easy and stay a while.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it here.

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,960
I can't stay too long.

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,500
--Oh, I see.
--I'm sorry.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,970
No, don't worry about it.

95
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,640
I've gotten kinda sleepy. I'm going home now.

96
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,060
Ah... hey!

97
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,930
Well then, see you later!

98
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,700
These guys are real pirates!

99
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,110
So clouds are really fluffy?

100
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,540
Daaachshund... Horsey-Bird...
Darn it! Why can't I remember them?!

101
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,620
Davy Back Fight, the large Navy fortress...

102
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,630
Sky islands and the sand country, Alabasta...

103
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,340
We really had such a grand journey?

104
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,760
Yes, we did.

105
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,890
I-I can't believe it...

106
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,050
The captain of this ship has a
100-million-Berry bounty on his head?

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,560
Hey, don't you have some
more neat adventure stories?

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
I joined your crew after you left Alabasta.

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,020
So, unfortunately, I don't know
what happened before that.

110
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,360
Darn! That sucks!

111
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,320
Although I have a hard time buying her story,

112
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,820
it is true that the seasonings and equipment

113
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,660
are where I would like them to be.

114
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,540
Robin-san, could you tell us about the
most crucial thing-- about yesterday?

115
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,210
Sure. Well then, let's include
the ship's doctor, too.

116
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,210
Hm?

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,260
Like I said, it's backwards.

118
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,800
Sh-Shut up, you bastard!

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,180
You're hungry, aren't you?
Come and eat with us.

120
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,890
Ahh! Don't be ridiculous!
I can't eat with humans!

121
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,810
May I ask your opinion, too?

122
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,690
Please, our exceptional ship's doctor?

123
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,360
Dummy! Praising me wouldn't
make me feel happy! You jerk!

124
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,740
He sure looks happy.

125
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,200
We were traveling this area of sea.

126
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,500
Nami, are you really sure
we're on the right track?

127
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't worry. The Log Pose
is pointing this direction.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,710
Usopp! Can't you see anything yet?

129
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,130
Err, hold on, okay?

130
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,380
Let's see... Ah! I see an island!

131
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,890
There are coral reefs scattered all over.

132
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,100
It's dangerous to keep heading ashore like this.

133
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,390
Let's drop anchor off the coast
tonight and land tomorrow morning.

134
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,390
What?

135
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,060
Are you saying you don't
wanna listen to your navigator?

136
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,150
Sanji-kun, Luffy won't be having dinner.

137
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,940
--What?!
--Okay, Nami-san!

138
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,740
After that, everyone went to bed except
for me, as I was doing some research,

140
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,620
and the swordsman, who was standing watch.

141
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,750
I know it's not much, but that's about it.

142
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,920
The rest is what you remember... probably...

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,630
Given the way the pirate hunter talked earlier,

144
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,840
it seems he fell asleep
partway through the night.

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,670
It would seem so.

146
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,590
Would you like another cup?

147
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,470
Yes, thank you.

148
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,970
In any case, I wonder why only you
didn't lose your memory, Robin-san...

149
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,270
If the swordsman was really asleep,
the only difference between you guys and me

150
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,060
is that you were sleeping and I wasn't.

151
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,690
Although I was asleep, I remember!
I'm certain that we're the Usopp Pirates!

152
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,160
In other words, sleep determined
whether we lost our memory or not?

153
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,040
I just stated the facts, that's all.
I can't draw any conclusions.

154
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,460
I've never heard of such a case.

155
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,500
Now, it's your turn.

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,380
Please tell me the very last thing you remember.

157
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,420
I thought I went to pick
medicinal herbs with Doctorine,

158
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,720
returned to the castle and went to bed.
And then, when I woke up, I was here.

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
As for me... Hey, you're ignoring me?

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,520
I fainted after being
swallowed by a big whirlpool.

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,690
And the next thing I knew, I was here.

162
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,900
I thought I went to bed in my room after work,

163
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,480
but when I woke up, I was here.

164
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,440
So you don't remember
anything after those points, huh?

165
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,040
That's right! I heard the sound
of a horn from somewhere and...

166
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,500
A horn... Yeah, a horn! I heard it, too.

167
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,830
Come to think of it...

168
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,040
A child suddenly appeared before my eyes!

169
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,930
Don't tell me... It's not that
we lost our memories...

170
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,550
...but in fact, that the kid
stole our memories from us?

171
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,760
I don't know if that's the case,

172
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,810
but it's certain that he
holds the key to this matter.

173
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,350
Isn't it possible that we'll lose more
memories each time we fall asleep?

174
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,900
--Ahhhh!
--Ahhhh!

175
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,020
Don't scare me like that!

176
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,240
Hey, wait. It happened in my dream, right?

177
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
A supernatural thing like that
can't actually happen, right?

178
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,030
Then how do you explain the fact
that we all had the same dream?

179
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,120
Supernatural or not, it's the fact.

180
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,250
I don't mean to scare you,
but in the worst-case scenario,

181
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,830
it's possible that you will no longer
be able to tell who you are.

182
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,210
Whoa! That scared me!

183
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,170
Hey, why do you care if we
remember things or not?

184
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,760
Sure, it sucks that I lost all those fun memories,

185
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,390
but we can just start over and go on
new adventures together, right?

186
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,980
D-Don't be ridiculous! We may
end up losing all our memories!

187
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,310
I-If that happens, our past
and dreams will all be--

188
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,020
They won't.

189
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,450
My dream won't be lost. It must
be the same for you guys, too.

190
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,200
Wh-What a positive thinker he is...

191
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,790
Our captain is the same...
whether or not he has his memories.

192
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,420
He's kinda amazing.

193
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,290
Ahh! My food is gone!

194
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,380
Don't touch other people's food!

195
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,630
Sorry...

196
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,260
I don't know if he's crazy or what...

197
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,470
...but I feel like I'm an idiot for
thinking about things seriously!

198
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,070
Where's the town?

199
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,090
This is kinda exciting!

200
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,380
Wha...

201
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,550
What're you making?

202
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,050
A-A new medicine for regaining
memories! Don't interfere.

203
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,930
--Did you find something?
--Ahhh! Don't touch that without asking!

204
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,020
--No. It seems like an ordinary island.
--Ugh! What the heck is this? It's bitter!

205
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,190
All right! Done!

206
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,610
This is, indeed, my great invention.

207
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,860
What the heck is that?

208
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,820
Thanks for asking! Now...

209
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,450
...we don't have to worry
even if we lose our memories!

210
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,950
I name them, "My name board"!

211
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,830
That's a good idea.

212
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,910
A question mark? That's rude!

213
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm not a raccoon dog or emergency food!

214
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,580
"Stupid Lovelyn"?!

215
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,170
How do you like my idea? Cool, huh?

216
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,180
Don't make stupid stuff!

217
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,600
My memories... huh...?

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,270
People are such fragile things, Zoro...

219
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,520
Zoro...

220
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,900
You're lucky, Zoro. You're a boy.

221
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,370
I want to be the world's
greatest swordsman, too!

222
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,080
You see, when girls grow up,
they get weaker than men...

223
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,160
It's frustrating!

224
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,250
If only... If only I had been born a man...!

225
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,790
Don't be whining like that after you beat me!

226
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,210
That's not fair! You're my goal!

227
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,090
--Zoro...
--Boy this, girl that!

228
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,260
Are you gonna say that stuff
too when I beat you someday?!

229
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,970
You act like none of it is skill!

230
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,390
You're insulting all the hard
training I've been doing!

231
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,600
So don't say that stuff! Promise me!

232
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,070
Someday, one of us will be
the world's greatest swordsman!

233
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,280
We'll compete to see who gets there!

234
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
You dummy. You're so weak...

235
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,790
It's a promise!

236
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,580
Sensei...

237
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
Let me have... that sword...

238
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,130
Kuina's sword?

239
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,420
I'm going to get stronger for her, too!

240
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,880
I'm going to get strong enough
that my name reaches to Heaven!

241
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,430
I'm going to be the world's
strongest swordsman!

242
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,300
I promised her...

243
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,140
I... I...

244
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,350
Yes. You can have it.

245
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,660
I leave Kuina's spirit and dreams... with you.

246
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,160
After that, I trained hard every day
and set out to sea to search for that man.

247
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,120
Aiming to become a master swordsman...

248
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,830
I got on a boat and went to sleep.
I remember up to that point.

249
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,090
After that... I can't remember
what happened after that at all.

250
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,420
What's weird, in the first place, is these swords.

251
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,050
When on earth did I obtain these two swords?

252
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,220
And yet, they suit me quite well.
What's going on?!

253
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,940
Who's there?!

254
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,250
The most current date on the logbook
is the day before the newspaper.

255
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,040
So it's consistent... but...

256
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,380
I can't believe it... Is what
that woman said all true?

257
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
If it is...

258
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,180
I'm a member of a pirate group...

259
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,010
Me...?!

260
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,230
There's... There's no way that's the case!

261
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,440
But this tattoo... What on earth happened to it?

262
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,150
I don't know what's going on!

263
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,400
I don't know...

264
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,450
You seem to be in excellent spirits,
pathetic humans!

265
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,870
As of this moment,
this island is under my control!

266
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,420
On this memorable day, you will
all buy your lives from me!

267
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,340
Those who can't pay... die!

268
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,710
I don't want to.

269
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,430
Why do we have to leave?

270
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,220
I... want to live in this village...

271
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,640
Is it because we're poor that I can't
be Bellemere-san's kid anymore?!

272
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,310
Hold it!

273
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,480
That 100,000's for my two daughters.
I don't got enough for me.

274
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,860
Bellemere! What are you--?!

275
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,910
I'm sorry, Gen-san. I just can't
say I don't have a family...

276
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,410
Even if it costs me my life...

277
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,250
Yeah, maybe we're not related by blood...

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,250
...but we're a family.

279
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,000
I want to be their parent,
even if it's only in name.

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,220
They're... my kids.

281
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,140
Bellemere-san!

282
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,850
I'm sorry! I was never able to
do anything mother-like for you!

283
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,940
That's not true!

284
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,060
We don't need anything! Just don't die!

285
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,900
Nami...

286
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,820
Make your dream... come true!

287
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,030
Live...!

288
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,530
Die with your pathetic love.

289
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,990
Nojiko! Nami!

290
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,420
I love you!

291
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,550
I'm joining the Arlong Pirates...

292
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,220
...to be a surveyor and draw sea charts!

293
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,060
Nami...

294
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,850
I made an agreement with Arlong
to buy Cocoyashi Village from him.

295
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,020
To buy the village?

296
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,400
For 100 million Berries. If I buy
the village, we can be free.

297
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,070
But, 100 million Berries?

298
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,610
I'm not sure you can earn that
much working your entire life!

299
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,110
I will earn it! No matter what it takes!

300
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,540
If I ask for help from anyone,
more people will get hurt.

301
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,200
It'll hurt, you know...

302
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,210
Yeah...

303
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,500
Staying with the people who
killed Bellemere-san'll hurt.

304
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,630
If you survive, lots of fun things will happen!

305
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,930
I'll be fine. I'll put on a big smile,
even when I see his face!

306
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,850
I've decided not to cry anymore.

307
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,810
I've decided to fight on my own!

308
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,610
Bellemere-san...

309
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,780
Can't wait...

310
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,750
I'll steal all the rest... All the rest...

311
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,380
Oh, shoot.

312
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,920
Did I wake you up?

313
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,470
--No...
--You can go back to sleep.

314
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,800
If I notice something unusual, I'll wake you up.

315
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,260
It's okay. Sorry, Robin-san.

316
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,850
Shall I make some coffee to help us stay awake?

317
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,810
Thanks. That would be great.

318
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,480
At any rate, he's sleeping like a log,

319
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,190
after saying that he was gonna
stay awake no matter what.

320
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,400
So you two weren't asleep yet?

321
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,280
So it was you who stole everyone's memories?

322
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,290
I'm surprised that you've noticed.

323
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
But it's too late.

324
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,340
Wake up! Everyone, wake up now!

325
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,090
Oh? I see you have some mysterious technique.

326
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,090
--Huh?
--Hm?

327
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,090
Ugh! He's here!

328
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,970
--Ahhh!
--What? Breakfast?

329
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,390
That wasn't nice, lady.
To think that you woke them up...

330
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,770
I guess it can't be helped now.
I didn't wanna do this.

331
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,820
Hm? Ahhhh!

332
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,160
What're you doing there?!

333
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,330
--What?
--I'm not gonna let you take that place!

334
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,500
I've decided that that place is my special seat!

335
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,620
Don't you dare...

336
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,830
...sit there without asking!

337
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,470
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,270
Okay.

339
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,270
Whoa?! Wh-What's this? What's this?

340
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,280
Argh! What the heck is this?!

341
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
It's scary!

342
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,780
Wh-What was that?

343
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,410
Hey, isn't he in trouble?

344
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,460
He's not moving.

345
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,790
Is he still alive?

346
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,290
Doctor! Doctor!

347
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,920
Oh, right, that's me.

348
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,050
My memories are back!

349
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

350
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

351
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

352
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

353
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

354
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

355
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

356
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

357
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

358
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

359
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

360
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

361
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

362
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

363
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

364
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

365
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

366
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,710
All right! My memories are back!
You are all my friends!

367
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,340
Cook, swordsman, navigator,
doctor, scholar, and... liar.

368
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,970
--Hey...
--Well then, we'll go bring back Nami and Zoro!

369
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,890
I totally agree about Nami-san,
but we don't need that man.

370
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,220
--Right, we don't.
--I guess we don't. No! We do!

371
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,140
We can't do without even one person!

372
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

373
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,860
"Now, Let's Get Back Our Memories!
The Pirate Crew Lands on the Island"

374
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,940
I'm gonna cut you jerks down!
