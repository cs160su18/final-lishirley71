up the "end of the dream"

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,480
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,430
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,310
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,830
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get the

77
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,800
Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize
- and won the first round

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,090
but now, he's heading for the palace to take

79
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,140
back Law who's been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,390
Meanwhile, Usopp and the others put

81
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,780
Operation SOP into action
along with the Tontattas

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,900
but their plot has been uncovered.

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,470
"The Last Light of Hope!
The Secret of Our Commander!"

84
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,430
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,210
Stick-Stickem...

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,700
...Meteora!

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,490
What?!

88
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,810
T-Trebol-sama is going crazy!

89
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,380
The Executive Tower has been destroyed!

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,470
THE ROYAL PALACE B-1

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,650
We keep getting blocked!

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,380
I told you! Pica can manipulate
this whole stone palace any way he likes!

93
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,150
Straw Hat!

94
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,130
Is he really going to be okay?!

95
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,320
You mean Zoro?

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,910
You don't have to worry about him!

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,030
He'll be fine no matter what!

98
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,490
What the...!

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,520
Rebecca has never made an attack
before but she just did it!

100
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,390
What kind of sword is that?

101
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,180
Its blade is blunt.

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,490
The ring is a place for killing.

103
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,330
If you can't cut anybody,
you'll have to shed your own blood!

104
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,030
It's what the people want to see!

105
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,370
Lock!

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,610
That's a direct hit!

107
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,650
The undefeated girl couldn't do anything!

108
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,820
Diamante!

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,260
Damn!

110
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey, Musclemelon!

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,280
No, I'm Bartolomeo...

112
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
Protect her!

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,670
What?!

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,810
Rebecca, do you know
how your mother Scarlet died?

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,770
I'm gonna go buy something to eat.

116
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,080
The Toy Soldier cried like a baby.

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,420
He was so pathetic.

118
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm sorry!

119
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,310
I couldn't protect your mother!

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,910
Our ship...

121
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,790
Why did Trebol-sama do this all of a sudden?

122
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,120
Usopp!

123
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,870
Usopp! Wake up!

124
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,910
What a relief!

125
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,160
--Robi...
--Shh!

126
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,620
Wh-What just happened?!
I saw a big duck falling from the ceiling!

127
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,180
I'll explain to you later. We have a problem!

128
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,540
Leo and the others got caught!

129
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,480
What?!

130
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,120
You prick!

131
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,500
Drop dead! Right now!

132
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm not gonna die, you little shit!

133
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,250
We're having a serious conversation now!

134
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,770
Don't get in my way!

135
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,910
Stop lying!

136
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm not gonna tell you!

137
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
I know someone is helping you - who is it?

138
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,510
Hey! Hey! What's his name?

139
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll never tell!

140
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,540
Yeah! Never, ever tell!

141
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,790
Let's run while we can, Robin!

142
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,020
Even though he's actually my friend?

143
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,960
What?

144
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,840
If I remember correctly, his name is...

145
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,410
You mean Usoland?

146
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,340
Hey!

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,660
You idiot! He's not my friend!

148
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,080
Oh no! I've been fooled!

149
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,680
Is the one-legged soldier
your associate, too?

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,000
I-I'm not gonna tell you!

151
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, I already know.

152
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,320
Oh, if you know, then it can't be helped!
He's our associate!

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
--I thought so!
--Oh no!

154
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,630
Now, we see some connections!

155
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,640
It doesn't matter anymore!
You people are finished!

156
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,680
Today is the decisive day!
We will pull off...

157
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,980
...this operation no matter what!

158
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,990
And we will...

159
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,410
...take back our friends at any cost!

160
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,640
Let me tell you something.

161
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,040
That sticky stuff is flammable!

162
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,500
What is it this time?!

163
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,580
Trebol-sama!

164
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,940
Hey!

165
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,110
Are you guys okay?!

166
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,370
Leo! Leo!

167
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,790
Everybody, are you okay?!

168
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,080
Stay with me! That was too reckless!

169
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,920
The operation is over! Let's run away!

170
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,470
I mean, you have to fall back!

171
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,900
You guys did all you can!
But you can't beat Trebol!

172
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,810
That's not an option!

173
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,980
We must complete Operation SOP...

174
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,360
...as soon as...

175
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,590
...possible.

176
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,880
Leo!

177
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,370
Then, the commander will...

178
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,560
...take down Doflamingo...

179
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,830
...for sure!

180
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,060
The commander is...

181
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,780
...waiting for us!

182
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,530
We must hurry!

183
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,620
Lao G, you bastard!

184
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,400
Lao G's "G"!

185
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,510
"G"!

186
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,170
"G"!

187
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
DRESSROSA - THIS MORNING

188
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,860
DON QUIXOTE DOFLAMINGO
WITHDRAWS FROM THE SEVEN WARLORDS

189
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,210
Doflamingo-sama withdraws
from the Seven Warlords?!

190
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't believe it!

191
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,700
Is he gonna step down
from the throne of Dressrosa?!

192
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,690
Yeah!

193
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,040
He's nothing but an ordinary pirate now!

194
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,630
He's gonna be chased by the Navy!

195
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,550
We're gonna be free!

196
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,020
Finally, we're free!

197
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Commander, did you see the newspaper?!

198
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,410
It means we're gonna have our friends back,
doesn't it?!

199
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,470
We no longer have to fight Doflamingo!

200
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,510
That's great!

201
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,770
No.

202
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,140
It was a false report.

203
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,310
What?!

204
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,660
No one's coming back!

205
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,320
No way!

206
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,610
I'm so glad that it was just a mistake!

207
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,900
He's a great man!
He's not gonna abdicate the throne!

208
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,720
Doflamingo-sama!

209
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm gonna enter today's competition
and win the Flare-Flare Fruit!

210
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,660
And I will take down Doflamingo!

211
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,430
Rebecca! Come to your senses!

212
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,250
I know you're angry!

213
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,140
So am I! But don't jump the gun!

214
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,340
We're gonna rise up! We're locked and loaded!

215
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,210
No! I'm not gonna wait!

216
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,060
Our hopes have been dropped
from heaven to the edge of hell.

217
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,970
No one here can take it anymore!
Their spirits are broken!

218
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,250
All there is left to do is
wait to be executed now.

219
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,780
We'll be released if we
can win a thousand times?

220
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,750
That's not hope!

221
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,230
That's a wall of despair!

222
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,570
The legendary gladiator Kyros won
3000 out of 3000 matches?!

223
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,780
Everybody knows that statue is
just make-believe!

224
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,510
Dying prisoners must have made up
their ideal warrior and that's Kyros!

225
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,700
They built the statue
wishing to be freed like him someday!

226
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,580
I'd rather not dream an impossible dream!

227
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,980
Today's competition is a
chance and I'll take it!

228
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,830
So...

229
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,230
It's not a chance!

230
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,610
It's impossible for you
to win that competition!

231
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,940
You're gonna die!
I won't allow you to enter it!

232
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,900
You're not thinking straight!

233
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,230
You're only 16!

234
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,440
Do you think of yourself
as an adult now, Rebecca?!

235
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,910
You're still a kid!
You must listen to what I say!

236
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,700
Oh, please! You're not even my parent!

237
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,390
You're the one who's not thinking straight!

238
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,160
What's your plan?!

239
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,080
You have no chance to beat Doflamingo!

240
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,610
Because you're...

241
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,240
...just a one-legged toy!

242
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,260
Yeah...

243
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,480
You're right!

244
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,050
N-No!

245
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,210
Sorry for being meddlesome

246
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,720
but I hope you're not gonna
enter the competition.

247
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,910
I didn't mean it! Soldier-san, don't go!

248
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,350
Please! Soldier-san!

249
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,370
I was just afraid that
you were gonna sacrifice yourself!

250
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,620
I'm sorry! Don't go, Soldier-san!

251
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,340
Soldier-san!!

252
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,220
It's shaking!

253
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,690
It must be Pica! What is he doing?!

254
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,890
You can't go after him!

255
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,370
Are you okay, Commander?!

256
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,800
Th-Thank you!

257
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,600
--Let's get going!
--Wait! They're gonna get beaten up!

258
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,710
Hey! Let go of me! You little bastards!

259
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,760
Stop looking back, Commander!

260
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
We were planning on
sacrificing ourselves from the beginning!

261
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't be silly!

262
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,180
What will happen if you stop here?!

263
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,660
Even if Leo and the others
pulled off Operation SOP,

264
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,060
if we let Doflamingo walk away,
he'll turn everything back again!

265
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,000
You're the only one who can bring
down Doflamingo, Commander!

266
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,160
Why do you care about the commander, Leo?

267
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,310
Why do you guys count on him so much?!

268
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,460
C-Commander!

269
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,120
Even if only he makes it...

270
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,990
He's just a one-legged toy!

271
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,320
Normally, people who are turned into toys
are bound by the contract

272
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,800
and they will become
workers who can't disobey.

273
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,860
The commander was the first person

274
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,370
ever in this country to get turned into a toy

275
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,440
but the Hobby-Hobby Fruit eater, Sugar...

276
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,310
...made a mistake forgetting
to make a contract!

277
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,070
Just one mistake from ten
years ago made him...

278
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,320
...the only toy in this country who
can get back at...

279
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,670
...the Don Quixote Family!

280
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,640
That's why he's been fighting
on his own for a decade!

281
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,040
If it weren't for him,
toys would have no choice...

282
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,740
...but to put up with it!

283
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,360
We Tontattas wouldn't know anything

284
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,060
and we all would have been enslaved by them!

285
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,130
If we ignore his rallying cry,

286
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,930
there'll be no chance of saving this country!

287
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,840
He's worth betting everything on!

288
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,080
Nobody remembers him now

289
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,580
but everybody knew him once!

290
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,950
When he was a Big Human, his name was...

291
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,010
...Kyros!

292
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,210
He was the strongest gladiator
in the history of the Colosseum!

293
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,190
That's who our commander is!

294
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,000
The Toy Soldier runs to reach Doflamingo

295
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,180
but a brutal enemy named Gladius stands
in his way!

296
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,660
When the Toy Soldierfs life is at stake

297
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,460
Due to Gladiusfs overwhelmingly
destructive power

298
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,400
Luffy rushes in like the wind!

299
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece

300
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,570
!
"The Rupture Human! Gladius Blows Up Big Time!"

301
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
