00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,690
In pursuit of Luffy, four of the
Straw Hats and the Franky Family

3
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,580
were nearing the courthouse. However...

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,380
Take us to the courthouse, Gomorrah!

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,850
Gomorrah!

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,150
Dammit! Who are they?!

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:00,120
"Guilty"

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,120
Not gonna be that easy... you damn trash.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,620
All right! The second one is down, too!

10
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,670
If we get surrounded in a place
like this, we'll be goners!

11
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,550
"Courthouse" "Rocketman"

12
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,550
Meanwhile, Sogeking was
around the main island front gate.

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,690
All right! Oimo and Kashii are back in business!

14
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,390
Oh, no...

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,820
We don't have much energy
left to fight guys like them.

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,450
Is this it for us?!

17
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,040
How...

18
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,960
...dare you...

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,300
Huh?

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,300
...deceive us?!

21
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,460
Before we rejoice over
the safety of our bosses...

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,810
Before we grieve over our wasted years...

23
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,360
We'll take out all our anger
on them in a furious rampage!

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,740
Let's go together... king of snipers!

25
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,200
Sogeking is now headed to Luffy
and the others with Oimo and Kashii.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,860
No need for formality! Hoist the
counterattack signal this time for sure!

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,950
Hurry to our comrades!

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,620
--This tastes terrible.
--You'll soon notice how big the change is.

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,550
This is the birth of new
Devil Fruit power-holders.

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,340
I look forward to seeing those powers.

31
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,550
Get a handle on your own powers
at least, while you have a chance.

32
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,810
"Courthouse"

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,570
Around the same time, Luffy was
waging a fierce battle against Blueno

34
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,360
on the rooftop of the courthouse.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,630
Iron Body!

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,650
Wheel!

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,960
Door-Door!

38
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,470
A-A door just opened on the ground!

39
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,590
Door-Door.

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,410
Wh-What the heck?!
Were there small doors here?!

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,600
Crap! I got stuck! Dammit!

42
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,810
Revolving Door.

43
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,000
What?! What?!
Wh-What's going on?! I feel dizzy!

44
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,780
Wh-Wh-Which way is forward?! Stop!

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,910
Tempest Kick!

46
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,710
Hey, Cook!

47
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,550
Yeah, I saw it.

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,640
Luffy's already fighting CP9.

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,800
What?!

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,400
There's only one path left!

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,020
Yeah, we're gonna make
a dash for the courthouse!

52
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,610
That's the only choice we have.

53
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,860
All right, let's go, guys!

54
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,400
--Yeah!
--Wait!

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,950
All of you, don't get off!

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,620
Chopper?!

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,340
Hold on tight!

58
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,180
Gomorrah... Gomorrah says so!

59
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,020
Go! Gomorrah!

60
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,940
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

61
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,830
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

62
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,840
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,720
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,430
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

65
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,400
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,730
we will be able to make it through

67
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,780
Always!

68
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,620
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

69
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,580
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

70
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,710
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

71
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,210
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

72
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,620
We can't stop here

73
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,550
Around the world

74
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,720
Start me up!

75
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,720
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

76
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,610
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

77
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,580
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

78
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,750
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

79
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,380
Brand New World

80
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,920
Start me up!

81
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:56,100
"Almost to Luffy!
Gather at the Courthouse Plaza!"

82
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,820
Hey, Gomorrah! Why are you
trying to crash yourself into walls?!

83
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,580
What's going on? So he can't go on after all?!

84
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,720
Th-That's not it! He can't see!

85
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,850
--What?!
--His eyesight has weakened
because his retinas got hurt!

86
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,810
What?! You can't see?!

87
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,730
It started running like crazy!

88
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,930
Don't break the encirclement!
Stop the monster!

89
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,690
What're you doing?!
Fire the trench mortars already!

90
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,480
Stop, Gomorrah!

91
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,460
You're in no shape to keep running anymore!

92
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,460
He says that he promised Sodom!

93
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,250
He said to Sodom, "Leave the rest to me!

94
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,590
I'll run with everyone on my back for you!"

95
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,940
Gomorrah...

96
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,220
They were inside its stomach?

97
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,940
I can't eat anymore. I'm full.

98
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,840
Let's take them back
with us for emergency food.

99
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,000
Bro! There's trouble! Some pirates
beat up Sodom and Gomorrah!

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,660
You've got some nerve
messing with my underlings!

101
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,960
Hey! You're injured!
Don't dance! Sodom! Gomorrah!

102
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,640
There's a dead end ahead!
He'll crash into it and die!

103
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,770
Gomorrah! Stop! Don't run randomly!

104
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,020
Stop!

105
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
Dead end? Do you see one?

106
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,940
Nope... I don't see anything of the sort.

107
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,820
It's the courthouse, Gomorrah!

108
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,660
W-We're here! Gomorrah!

109
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,080
This report is for all units!

110
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,620
The King Bull with the pirates on it broke
through the encirclement in Block D!

111
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,130
"Courthouse" "Tower of Law"

112
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,500
They've just reached the courthouse plaza!

113
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,790
I repeat! The pirates...!

114
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,710
Look at this... Funkfreed.

115
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,520
It's a golden transponder snail.

116
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,680
Just like the authority to exercise Buster Call,

117
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,230
this shiny transponder snail
is indeed a valuable item

118
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,020
that can only be carried with the permission

119
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,530
of someone ranked admiral or
above in Navy Headquarters.

120
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,460
In order for me to exercise Buster Call,
Aokiji temporarily entrusted it to me.

121
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,950
Just wait and see! Once the revival
of the weapon becomes reality,

122
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,420
I'll be able to carry this myself, instead of
having some admiral entrust it to me,

123
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,510
and control troops at will.

124
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,430
Buster Call...

125
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,660
I'm exercising a Buster Call.

126
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,720
Commence concerted fire!

127
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,440
We're targeting everything on Ohara,
the island of archaeology!

128
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,230
Just by pressing this button,
an entire island can be wiped out.

129
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,330
Authority can be like a weapon too, huh?

130
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,810
Chief Spandam!

131
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,620
Ahhhh! That scared me!

132
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,750
What's your problem?! Knock on the door first!

133
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,090
I almost accidentally pressed the button!

134
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,920
I-I'm sorry. But I was told
that this is an emergency.

135
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,430
There's a call from the Enies Lobby main island!

136
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,440
What?! A call?! They should've
called this room directly!

137
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,740
Hm? Hey! The receiver is off!

138
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,190
This happens all the time! Who's behind it?!

139
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,440
Hm? You just said that it's an
emergency or something, didn't you?

140
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,620
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,660
Spanda!

142
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,960
Hey, Nico Robin!

143
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,510
There seems to be an emergency report
from the Enies Lobby main island.

144
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,980
It's probably not really an emergency,
but you can guess what it's about, right?

145
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,770
What happened to Straw Hat Luffy,

146
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,150
who worked hard to beat up
a whole five soldiers...

147
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,880
How your friends got stomped

148
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,370
by the strongest gatekeepers,
Oimo and Kashii...

149
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,780
Let's hear together what happened to the idiots

150
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,020
who went against the World Government!

151
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,620
You're so low!

152
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,130
Shut up, you punk!

153
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,290
Hey, guard!

154
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,430
This is Spandam.

155
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,180
Oh, is this the Chief?! Good!
I can finally give you a report!

156
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,190
I don't know where to start.

157
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,810
Calm down, you idiot! You wanna
talk about the Straw Hats, right?

158
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,610
What happened after the
last report? Oh, wait! Listen.

159
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,150
When you report, summarize
the crucial points briefly

160
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,910
and explain them clearly with a loud voice.

161
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,070
--Yes, sir! The invaders--
--Did you accidentally kill them?

162
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,280
Well, that's their own fault for being so weak.

163
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,660
The pirates, who number about sixty,

164
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,830
have invaded and pushed
into the courthouse plaza,

165
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,300
the farthest point in the
Enies Lobby main island!

166
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,010
To all units on Enies Lobby main island!

167
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,000
All soldiers! Head to the
courthouse plaza immediately!

168
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,560
You did a good job, Gomorrah!

169
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,440
We won't waste the boost
you two brothers gave us!

170
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,330
We're gonna attack, guys!
We'll rescue Big Bro Franky!

171
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,740
Yeah!

172
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,040
The pirates have reached the courthouse plaza!

173
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,270
Can you see Luffy?

174
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,950
No.

175
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,490
If the rooftop is that high,
we can't just climb up there.

176
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,260
No... It's not like we're made of rubber.

177
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,640
How many CP9 members did you see?

178
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,890
It was only the big horn guy we saw.

179
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,800
It's hard to believe that all of
them are in a place like that

180
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,400
with Robin-chan and Franky.

181
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,110
In any case, we have to
catch up with Luffy quickly!

182
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,730
We have to hurry up and rescue Robin!

183
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,980
Hurry to the courthouse plaza!

184
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,200
The drawbridge isn't down yet! Corner them!

185
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,500
Ribbit!

186
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,210
Whoa! What an amazing frog!

187
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,890
That's the iron ball that knocked
down Gomorrah! Who did that?!

188
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,760
Ribbit!

189
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Over there! They're running away!
There are three of them!

190
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,480
Why are they running away?
They're the ones who started the attack.

191
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,320
You idiot! It's a waste of time chasing
after each enemy who runs away!

192
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,630
Shut up. I just went to check.

193
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,220
It wouldn't hurt to know what kind
of enemies would attack us, would it?

194
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,180
Whoa! He brought him down!

195
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,680
What is this guy?!

196
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,180
He must have Herculean strength
to swing around something like this!

197
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,150
Does he belong to a special
unit like the Watchdogs?

198
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,410
There may be more hiding. Be careful.

199
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,790
Now, let's hurry up.
The guards are closing in on us.

200
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,320
Corner them!

201
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,200
They're not gonna be able to open the
courthouse's heavy stone doors anyway!

202
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,250
Bring them down here in the plaza!

203
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,710
Come to think of it, these are huge doors.

204
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,180
How will we...

205
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,170
...get them open...?

206
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,430
Get a move on! I'll go on ahead!

207
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,770
H-He cut through that thick stone!

208
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,100
Zambai!

209
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,230
We'll split up and go to both sides

210
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,940
in order to pull down the drawbridge's levers!

211
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,110
O-Okay! I'm counting on you guys!

212
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,410
All right! We'll split into three groups!

213
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,370
Those who come with me will thoroughly
clean house inside the courthouse!

214
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,620
I don't need many!

215
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,130
Good luck, guys! Disperse!

216
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,140
"Courthouse" "Tower of Law"

217
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,010
Huh?

218
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,300
Also, the giant gatekeepers
at the main island front gate,

219
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,810
Oimo and Kashii, went over to the pirates' side!

220
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,070
They're currently around the center of the
main island running towards the courthouse!

221
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,610
Get outta our way!

222
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,580
The casualties of our guards are...

223
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,490
...over 2,000!

224
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,700
N-Not five...?

225
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,160
And the captain, Straw Hat Luffy,
who beat over 1,000 all by himself,

226
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,420
suddenly disappeared, so we're
searching for him right now!

227
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,800
This is probably unprecedented--
the worst situation we've had

228
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,310
in the history of Enies Lobby!

229
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,430
Blueno...

230
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,230
What's he doing in a place like that?

231
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,690
What's going on?

232
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,910
What the hell is happening
on this island right now?!

233
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,940
My face door finally closed!

234
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,620
Of course. An opened door is meant to close.

235
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,570
I'm surprised that you could
dodge the tempest kick.

236
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,280
Yeah. Well, it's a piece of cake.

237
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,820
I resent that.

238
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,920
You jerk!

239
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,420
He jumped!

240
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,130
Finger Pistol!

241
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,850
Shave!

242
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,510
Iron Body! Smash!

243
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,940
Gum-Gum... Bullet!

244
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,270
Iron Body!

245
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,780
Tempest Kick!

246
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,290
He's completely keeping up with my speed.

247
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,590
He changed the course of the Tempest Kick!

248
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,930
He's got unbelievable physical abilities!

249
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,510
No good.

250
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,350
Hm?

251
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,550
I'm no good like this.

252
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,430
When Aokiji defeated me, I thought...

253
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,810
"If I am to encounter more
strong guys like him in the future,

254
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,700
I won't be able to protect my friends...
unless I become stronger."

255
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,780
I have friends I want by my side
even if they're not strong.

256
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,170
So if I don't get stronger
than anyone, I'll lose all of them.

257
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,160
Then what're you gonna do?

258
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,070
I came up with a way to
fight with all my might...

259
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,750
...so that I won't lose anyone...

260
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,020
So that no one will go far away.

261
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,520
What's he doing?
What's happening inside his body?!

262
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,780
You'll now... no longer be
able to keep up with me.

263
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,900
What?

264
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,660
All my techniques will evolve one step further.

265
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,240
Second... Gear!

266
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,130
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

267
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,050
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

268
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,180
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

269
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

270
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
We'll become No. 1

271
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,310
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

272
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,520
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

273
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,690
an era created by risking everything

274
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,820
We always try our best, let's go!

275
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
If we want to achieve glory,

276
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,200
now is the time--don't be afraid

277
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

278
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,080
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

279
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,080
We can take off with unknown powers

280
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,340
We don't fear, and we don't waver

281
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,050
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

282
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,090
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

283
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

284
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,310
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

285
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Charge ahead

286
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,190
Let's start running towards tomorrow

287
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,460
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

288
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm glad that I met you guys here.

289
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,330
Hmph! What kind of bluff is that?

290
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,910
You'll now... no longer be
able to keep up with me.

291
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,250
Can't be...! I can't see him at all!

292
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,840
Gum-Gum...!

293
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,130
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,170
"Everything Is to Protect My Friends!
Second Gear Activated!"

295
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,610
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
