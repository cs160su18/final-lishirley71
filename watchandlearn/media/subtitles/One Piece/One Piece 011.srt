2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,640
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,350
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,610
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,790
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:25,290
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,420
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,400
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,180
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,200
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,260
You're nothing but the
son of a filthy pirate!

25
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,950
Filthy?!

26
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,930
I feel for you.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,300
You must truly hate your
great idiot of a father

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,420
for abandoning his family and village
because of his lust for treasure!

29
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,700
Don't you dare insult
my father any more!

30
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,710
Only then will I inherit
her enormous fortune!

31
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,670
Hey, you guys! Don't attack that girl!

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,020
"Expose the Plot!
Pirate Butler Captain Kuro"

33
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,180
Our captain's been gone a long time...

34
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,240
Luffy, too.

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,150
It was a big shock for him...

36
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
He always watches the sea from
the shore when he's feeling down!

37
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,640
--Captain!
--Captain!

38
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,650
Huh? Wasn't Luffy with him?

39
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,830
--Captain!
--Captain!

40
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,430
Where's Luffy?
Wasn't he at the shore with...

41
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,150
Is he still mad about
his dad being insulted?

42
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,770
Who knows?

43
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,620
No, that look was different!

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah, something must've happened!

45
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,820
Why do you suppose he
looked so desperate?!

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,210
Hey, how do we get
to this shore of yours?

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,830
Doesn't this smell like an incident?!

48
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,960
Yeah, something must've
happened at the shore!

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,120
I think this calls for the Usopp Pirates!

50
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,140
Alright, already!
How do we get there?!

51
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,230
T-Terrible... news...

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,820
Terrible news, everyone!

53
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,120
Pirates are going to attack!

54
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,430
Tomorrow morning, pirates are
going to attack this village!

55
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,340
Everyone, run away! Everyone...

56
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,410
What are you all doing?! Everyone!

57
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,440
Alright, Usopp! Enough is enough!

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,080
You're gonna pay once and for all!

59
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,120
N-No, it's not like that!

60
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
It's the truth this time!

61
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,730
Shut up! All you ever
do is spout huge lies!

62
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,630
If you were as honest as Klahadore-san,

63
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,770
then we'd believe you!

64
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,740
No matter what he does,
it won't matter.

65
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,540
Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak!

66
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
Damn it!

67
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,580
So he ignored me because
nobody'd believe me anyway?!

68
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,950
Are these to your liking?

69
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,390
They're the ones you custom-ordered
from the eyewear shop...

70
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,830
...in the next town over.

71
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,810
Yes, they're perfect!

72
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm sorry for asking you
to go all the way there.

73
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,520
It's a present, isn't it?

74
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,420
Yes. Tomorrow is actually
exactly three years since the day

75
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,390
Klahadore came to this mansion.

76
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,490
He's always taken good care of me, so...

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,480
Klahadore-san will be delighted!

78
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,550
Yes!

79
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,700
Please, hear me out, everyone!

80
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,790
Pirates really are going to
attack tomorrow morning!

81
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,800
If we believed every
story you ever told,

82
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,320
we'd have fled the village
hundreds of times by now!

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,760
Please, believe me!
We gotta get out of here!

84
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,110
They really are going to kill everyone!

85
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,690
I swear it's the truth this time!

86
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,280
And we're gonna get you this time!

87
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,180
Dammit!

88
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,990
Get him! Don't let him escape!

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,460
This is the place!

90
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,800
Our captain always heals
his emotional pain here!

91
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
It is nice here!

92
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,740
That straw hat guy isn't here...

93
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,880
It's pretty fragile here...

94
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,350
Nami. Don't fall now.

95
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,140
Yeah.

96
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,010
L-Look! There!

97
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,220
What the--?!

98
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,890
There he is!

99
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,370
It's the straw hat guy!

100
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,280
And his butt.

101
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,770
Luffy! How did this happen?!

102
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,630
He fell!

103
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,540
He's a goner!

104
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,950
So that's why our captain...

105
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,860
Quiet!

106
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,640
This guy...

107
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,640
Morning!

108
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,300
Usopp-san!

109
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,580
Thank goodness!

110
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,660
I thought you might never come back...

111
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,600
You gotta run, Kaya!
They're gonna kill you!

112
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,160
Eh? What?

113
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
You've been tricked!
That butler is really a pirate!

114
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Hold on. What kind of joke is this?

115
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,850
It's no joke!
I heard it with my own ears!

116
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,020
Klahadore's really a pirate who
weaseled his way into your mansion

117
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,950
so he could get your fortune!

118
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,350
He's been pretending to be a
butler for three years straight,

119
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,470
so he could get your fortune!

120
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,710
What are you talking about, Usopp-san?

121
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,690
He said his crew's gonna storm
in and kill you at dawn tomorrow!

122
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,980
He's a really bad guy!
You gotta escape, quick!

123
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,350
I admit, he did say too much earlier.

124
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,160
But lying like this...

125
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,630
It's not like you, Usopp-san!

126
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,030
No, it's not a lie...

127
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,520
It's the truth...

128
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,770
It's the truth!

129
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,290
Eh?! They're going to kill Kaya-san?!

130
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,510
Are they really going
to attack the village?!

131
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,510
Yeah, that's what they said.
No question about it.

132
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,520
So what were you
sleeping down here for?

133
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,910
That's the thing!

134
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,440
I thought I was up on the cliff...

135
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,010
So how'd I get down here?

136
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,720
I knew it! Klahadore's a bad guy!

137
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,280
It's no wonder he seemed so creepy!

138
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,200
So that's why our captain ran to
the village with that intense look!

139
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,550
That's great, then!

140
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,520
Now they'll know, and
can run away beforehand!

141
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,950
Talk about stupid bad guys!

142
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,960
Yeah, that's right!
We gotta run away, too!

143
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,790
Yeah! We gotta organize
all our prized possessions...

144
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,500
--...and hurry!
--...and hurry!

145
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,050
Oh, no!

146
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,070
What is it?

147
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,990
We need to stock up on food
before the meat shop guy runs away!

148
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,330
That's not the issue at hand here.

149
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,900
Tell me, Usopp-san.

150
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,610
What kind of story do you have today?

151
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,940
Right. Hmm, let's see...

152
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,790
Alright!

153
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,320
This story happened when I was five,

154
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,450
when I fought a giant goldfish
living in the southern sea!

155
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,780
Goldfish? You fought a goldfish?

156
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,370
Yeah! It was so big,

157
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,720
not even a fish tank the size
of this mansion could've held it!

158
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh, my!

159
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,920
What first shocked me was...

160
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,980
...the immense size
and length of its poop!

161
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,630
It was so big that I landed on it,

162
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,660
thinking it was solid ground!

163
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,470
That sounds fake!

164
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,640
But it's the truth!

166
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,940
So, first off, starting a bonfire to
dry off my clothes was a bad idea.

167
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,520
How come?

168
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,890
Well, you see...

169
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,520
...the goldfish's butt caught
on fire and freaked it out!

170
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,430
Oh, dear!

171
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,190
Though I guess I can't say I blame it.

172
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,410
It was so close to
becoming a grilled goldfish!

173
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,210
I... I loved them.

174
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,210
I loved the lies you told...

175
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,490
Yet, why are you saying this?

176
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,600
It's not like that! I'm not
trying to get back at Klahadore...

177
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,240
Why do you say it?

178
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,520
Kaya... I'm...

179
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,240
Is something the matter, Miss?!

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,460
You gotta escape, Kaya!

181
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,370
Stop, Usopp-san!

182
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,330
Let go of her!

183
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,890
Just trust me!

184
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,600
You gotta get out of this village,

185
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,260
before that butler gets back!

186
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,390
Stop!

187
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,640
Come on!

188
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,240
This'll all make sense come tomorrow!

189
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,030
But you gotta escape for now!

190
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,280
Please, listen to me!

191
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,690
You're pathetic.

192
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,570
Get away from her!

193
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,620
No!

194
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,380
Please, catch him!

195
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,470
He roughed up the lady of the house!

196
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,620
--How horrible!
--How could he?!

197
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,870
Why...

198
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,950
...won't anyone believe me?

199
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,840
There he is! Get him!

200
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,910
Usopp-san...

201
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,660
Please pull yourself together, Miss!

202
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,890
Thank you for coming, men.

203
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,970
It's truly been three long years.

204
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,290
Once this plan succeeds,

205
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,430
I intend to give you
all plenty of the take.

206
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,130
At dawn tomorrow,

207
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,510
destroy the village
to your hearts' content!

208
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,160
Who are you?!

209
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,730
I'm Usopp!
A brave warrior of the sea!

210
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,860
I hear you've been unhappy lately!

211
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll cheer you up with a story!

212
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,860
Mind your own business!

213
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,200
Please leave! I'll call for someone!

214
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,530
Now, now, don't sweat it!
I'm always meddlesome!

215
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,750
When I was three, my meddling
even led me to save a sick whale!

216
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,040
Eh? A whale?

217
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
You bet!

218
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,520
It was huge, and had
a really sore throat,

219
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,750
so I went inside its mouth,
but it thought I was food!

220
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,430
Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak!

221
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,130
--Captain!
--Captain!

222
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,370
Oh, hey, guys!

223
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,850
Yo!

224
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,560
You're alive?!

225
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,240
Alive? Yeah, I just woke up!

226
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,090
This guy was asleep the whole time!

227
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,100
Anyways, Captain!
We heard everything!

228
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,530
Let's hurry and tell
everyone about the pirates!

229
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,260
Tell everyone?

230
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,760
You're pathetic.

231
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,480
Shut up! All you ever
do is spout huge lies!

232
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,850
If you were as honest as Klahadore-san,

233
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,710
then we'd believe you!

234
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm lying like usual, obviously!

235
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,790
That damn butler pissed me off,

236
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,490
so I decided to claim he's a pirate!

237
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,040
Oh!

238
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,060
So you put the straw
hat guy up to it, too!

239
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
Hey? What's wrong?

240
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,420
I think less of you now.

241
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,200
Me too.

242
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,260
Me too!

243
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,360
Even if that butler is a jerk,

244
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,410
I never thought you'd
lie to hurt someone!

245
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,260
We really respected you, too!

246
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,170
I was all wrong about him!

247
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,320
Same here!

248
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,340
Let's go home!

249
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,200
Yeah! It's suppertime!

250
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,570
Wonder what we're having...

251
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,510
Oww!

252
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,400
There, all done!

253
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,810
Why did you tell them that?

254
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,380
Because I'm a liar.

255
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,230
They were never going to
believe me from the start.

256
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,110
I was too optimistic.

257
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,060
Even so, the truth is the truth.

258
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,230
Pirates really are going
to come, aren't they?

259
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,550
Yeah. They're definitely gonna show up.

260
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,320
But everyone thinks it's a lie.

261
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,330
They think tomorrow'll be just
another normal, peaceful day...

262
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,050
That's why I'm going to stop the
pirates at the beach tomorrow,

263
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,830
and make sure this stays a lie!

264
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,800
That's the only logical thing
for a liar like me to do!

265
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,080
Even if I get shot in the arm,

266
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,280
even if I'm driven off with brooms,

267
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,920
this is my village!

268
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,360
I love this village!

269
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,650
I want to protect everyone!

270
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,630
You're one hell of a nice guy,

271
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,200
pushing your henchmen away
and going into battle alone!

272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,670
Just so you know, I have dibs
on all the pirates' treasure!

273
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,610
Alright! We'll help you out!

274
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,580
You guys... are going
to fight with me?! Why?

275
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,420
There's a whole bunch
of bad guys, right?

276
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,060
"Scared" is written all over your face.

277
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,020
M-Me, scared?!

278
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,190
I'm perfectly okay with lots
of bad guys or whatever!

279
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,990
Because I'm Captain Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea!

280
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,610
Dammit! Dammit! This isn't a show!

281
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,960
These are Klahadore's
pirates we're dealing with!

282
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,820
Of course I'm scared!
What's wrong with that?!

283
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,190
I don't want your sympathy!
You guys can leave! Leave!

284
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,930
We ain't laughing! We're helping
'cause we think you're honorable!

285
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,760
As if we'd risk our lives
because of sympathy!

286
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,240
Oh... You guys...

287
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

288
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

289
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

290
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

291
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

292
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

293
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:20,010
so that my memories won't fade

294
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,430
Huh? Why'd Usopp
cover this slope in oil?

295
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,790
It's his Oil Strategy.

296
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,510
What a weird strategy.

297
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,410
But where are the pirates?

298
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,850
What?! They're at the north shore?!

299
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,660
I'll go on ahead!

300
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,190
They're gonna take my treasure!

301
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,720
North, north! Which way is north?!

302
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,960
Damn you, Nami!

303
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,420
On the next episode of One Piece!

304
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,060
"Clash with the Black Cat Pirates!
Great Battle on the Slope!"

305
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
