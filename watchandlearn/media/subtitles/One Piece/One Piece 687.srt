00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

75
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,420
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,500
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,670
and have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,070
Doflamingo trapped everybody
in the country in the Birdcage

82
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,450
and put Dressrosa in chaos.

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,480
On top of that, he put prices on
the heads of Luffy and 11 others.

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,480
While the Don Quixote Family awaits,

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
Luffy is heading for the Royal Palace
to take down Doflamingo!

86
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,850
His name is Corazon.

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,800
The former top executive of
the Doflamingo Family!

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,530
What?! Was he a member of his clan?

89
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,310
Yes, he was.

90
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,150
He also saved my life and was...

91
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,880
...Doflamingo's...

92
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,110
...biological young brother!

93
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,520
Wait, Viola!

94
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,650
Why are they so important to you?!
They're pirates!

95
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,830
Yes, they're unlawful men - who will break
this country's deceptive peace!

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,420
Father-sama, I decided to trust them,
the Straw Hat Pirates!

97
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,250
King Riku-sama!

98
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,870
The Straw Hats aka Usolanders
are Dressrosa's hope!

99
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,890
Even though they're pirates,
we're gonna trust them to the end!

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,270
Straw Hat-san, we're almost
at the first level!

101
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,190
Yeah! We're the first to arrive!
No one's here yet!

102
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,870
Gum-Gum...

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,640
...Fire Salute!

104
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,060
All right! Keep up the pace, Moocy!

105
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,730
Let's go!

106
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,340
"A Big Collision!
Chief of Staff - Sabo vs. Admiral Fujitora!"

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,950
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,740
Doflamingo!

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,290
It's odd!

110
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,170
Ah! It's very odd!

111
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,820
How could those idiots from the Colosseum
climb all the way up here?!

112
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,640
I thought there were thousands of Navy soldiers
down there!

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,970
I thought there were-in!

114
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,030
As well as Vice Admiral Bastille
and Navy HQ Admiral Fujitora!

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,120
How did they make their way through?!

116
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,540
Hey! What was that?!
The Don Quixote Family's military force?!

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,490
We'll reach their boss soon!

118
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,170
Outta my way! I go first!

119
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,560
All right, go straight up, Farul!
This is the stairway to stardom!

120
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,290
In...

121
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,770
Damn the Navy... So useless!

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,230
There are more coming!

123
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,110
What?!

124
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
I have a report!

125
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,940
Straw Hat Luffy's arriving at
the first level...

126
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,860
Gum-Gum...

127
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,510
...Gatling!

128
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
Outta my way!

129
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,860
--You're in Straw Hat-san's way...
--Don't stand in his way, you idiots!

130
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,260
Don't you stand behind me, either!
Get off!

131
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,260
Don't say that! Let us follow you!

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,350
Straw Hat-san!

133
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,390
What's wrong with these guys...

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,850
--Straw Hat!
--You can't go any farther!

135
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,770
Gum-Gum...

136
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,380
...Stamp Gatling!

137
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,120
Yeah! Nice! Straw Hat-san!

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,040
Here I come, Mingo!

139
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,710
We can't... c-compete with him...

140
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,130
Straw Hat!

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,050
They're all getting knocked down!

142
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,890
W-We also have
the Colosseum group coming up!

143
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,750
Get out of my way! Destruction Cannon!

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,830
Straw Hat!

145
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,510
What are you guys doing-in, you idiots?!

146
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,140
Do you wanna screw up
Young Master-sama's game-in?!

147
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,350
Can't they take down one guy at least?

148
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,900
Disappointin"g"!

149
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,730

...the "G"!

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,450
No matter how much he says "G"...

155
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,660
We're no match to them...

156
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,380
Oh no!

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,770
You jerk! You almost hurt me!

158
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,430
Weaklings are meant to be cleared out!

159
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,970
What did you say?!

160
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,850
Bye!

161
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,200
My goal is just to repay my debt
to God Usopp and his friends!

162
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,850
And...

163
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,950
...to make the headlines of the newspapers!

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,710
THE PIRATE NOBLE - CAVENDISH
OF THE WHITE HORSE

165
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,510
Why don't you guys keep fighting
a little war over there?

166
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,160
--Dammit! I will...
--...Repay my debt!

167
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,960
Ah! Everybody's coming!
Even the Colosseum group!

168
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,650
I see them, Dellinger!

169
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,140
All the Navy people are getting hung up!

170
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,340
What?!

171
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,980
No matter how I ask you,
you're not going to move out of our way?

172
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,120
Let me think.

173
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,500
The Straw Hat Pirates,

174
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,450
and those warriors who support them.

175
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,550
I can't let anyone who's trying to hurt them...

176
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,110
...go any farther!

177
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,380
Is it the Revolutionary Army's job
to give cover to pirates?

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,950
Yes, it is.

179
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,620
As a member of the Revolutionary Army,
I won't let you through.

180
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,700
No, that's not true.

181
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,790
I mean, it's my duty as his brother!

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,590
Oh...

183
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,590
I wonder who's brother you are.

184
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,730
Wait! He's out of your league-dara.

185
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,220
But Vice Admiral-dono...!

186
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,040
Vice Admiral, huh?

187
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
He's right.

188
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,980
Even if you all attack me at once,

189
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,300
you can't defeat me.

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,840
You bastard!

191
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,790
You did it!

192
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,290
Don't mess with us Navy, brat!

193
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,030
It doesn't work.

194
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,290
I'm a Flare-Flare Fruit eater!

195
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,120
You're pissing us off!

196
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,250
We Navy can't be defeated by a single member of the Revolutionary Army!

197
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,920
Wait! Don't do it-dara!

198
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
Shoot!

199
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,220
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

200
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,770
I said "Don't"!

201
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,030
This asshole!
He has extremely powerful fingers!

202
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,330
They're "claws"!

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,890
Fire Fist!

204
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,190
Fire Fist!

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,280
Guys!

206
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,490
He's a Logia eater!
Physical attacks won't work against him!

207
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,520
--Logia?
--He's a devil!

208
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,040
How horrible it is-dara.

209
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,050
To let the No.2 of the Revolutionary Army
have such a Devil Fruit.

210
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,640
Step back!

211
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,020
You guys can't beat him-dara!

212
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,650
You bastard!

213
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,620
Dodge!

214
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,210
Your Shark-Cleaver isn't just
for show!

215
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,710
You little brat!

216
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,090
You run around like a cat.

217
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,530
I'm gonna bring you down
including those claws

218
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,700
that you're so proud of-dara!

219
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,580
My fingers are...

220
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,350
...the claws of a dragon!

221
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,350
The claws that rip apart
those bigoted people...

222
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,260
...in power!

223
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,580
Vice Admiral Bastille's Shark-Cleaver is...

224
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,430
You little shit!

225
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,000
These claws can...

226
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,000
...crush human skulls...

227
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,250
...like an egg!

228
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,860
I have a problem.

229
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:43,770
Since that Bird Cage thing is in its way,
my meteor's going to be sliced, isn't it?

230
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,340
--Run!
--It's a meteorite!

231
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,080
Oops! What a fine mess!

232
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,250
It's all over the place...

233
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,910
I hope no civilians got hurt.

234
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,370
When you plan to bring down a meteorite,
let us know, Issho-san!

235
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,630
Oh, I'm sorry! I brought one down!

236
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,360
Before you do it!

237
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,980
Bastille-san!

238
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,150
Do you know the position you're in?

239
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,740
Only a Navy admiral could do that.
What power...

240
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,760
I still haven't gotten used to my own power...

241
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,330
So I tried to ward it off.

242
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,420
Vice Admiral Bastille!

243
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,370
Vice Admiral-dono!

244
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,270
You've really created havoc...

245
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,480
Huh?! You've done most of it!

246
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,920
You said "brotherly duty" earlier...

247
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,060
Yeah.

248
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,170
The man who had the Flare-Flare Fruit power before you -

249
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,830
"Fire Fist" Ace who died in the War of the Best...

250
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,120
...claimed that he was Straw Hat's adopted brother but...

251
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,710
...you're saying you're his brother, too?

252
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,000
Did you guys know?!

253
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,700
We can become brothers
if we exchange this cup of sake!

254
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,130
Yeah!!

255
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,740
We three exchanged the cup of sake.

256
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,170
Our bond can't be broken
even if anyone tries.

257
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,850
What a terrible set of three brothers.

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,660
What kind of brothers are they?!

259
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,200
Straw Hat's brothers...

260
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,450
One of them was
a commander of the White Beards!

261
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,400
And the other one is
No.2 of the Revolutionary Army?!

262
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,120
Just remember.

263
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,340
If Luffy ever calls for my help,

264
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,140
no matter where I am in the world,
I'll be there - forget my position!

265
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,230
I never...

266
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,820
ACE DIES

267
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,590
--Sabo-kun!
--Sabo!

268
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,750
...wanna go through that again...

269
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,260
It's senseless to ask you
any more questions.

270
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,850
You have no interest, anyway, do you?

271
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,230
I don't have a cup of sake
to go along with your stories.

272
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,770
Luffy.

273
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,630
You're our little brother!

274
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,440
Luffy is...

275
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,020
...my brother to save!

276
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,910
Robin and the others, trying to join Luffy,

277
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,670
go for a make-or-break mighty flight,

278
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,260
and take Tontatta Airlines straight
to the Royal Palace!

279
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,750
Meanwhile, as the group of ruffians

280
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,960
makes a steady progress,
Luffy and the others fall behind

281
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,530
but suddenly charge into a secret shortcut

282
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,190
to the Palace trying to make a big comeback!

283
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,020
"A Desperate Situation! Luffy Gets Caught in a Trap!"

285
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,070
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
