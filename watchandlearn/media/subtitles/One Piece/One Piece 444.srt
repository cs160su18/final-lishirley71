2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,780
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,780
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,990
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,410
With the help of the queen
of New Kama Land Ivankov,

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,540
Luffy got to level 6 where Ace was held!

54
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,420
We transfer custody of the criminal
- Portgaz D. Ace to the Navy!

55
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,680
But it was too late! Ace was already on
a ship heading to the Navy Headquarters!

56
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,430
I'm gonna go to Navy Headquarters!

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,350
After letting Jimbei and Luffy's former enemy
--- Crocodile out of their cells,

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,270
they are about to reach level 4!

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,270
"Even More Chaos! Here
Comes Blackbeard Teech!"

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,410
LEVEL 2 WILD BEAST HELL

61
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,030
Hurry up!

62
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,830
What's going on out there?

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,330
--Camisole!
--Long johns!

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,040
Everyone, get down to level 4!

65
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,550
Everyone, get down to level 4!

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,760
I heard some kind of announcement too.

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,720
Maybe something has happened in the prison.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,640
Hey, Buggy! Look!

69
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,640
All the jailers and Blugoris are leaving!

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,690
Everyone, get down to level 4 now!

71
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,020
Wow! All the beasts are going away!

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,740
--Go away, you fools!
--Don't ever come back!

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,410
Seems like they've got a problem
somewhere else, partner!

74
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,950
This is our big chance!

75
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,870
You're right!

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,170
When I look back, we've been chased
by the Army Wolves in level 5...

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,210
That was pretty clever of them!

78
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,760
We've suffered the remnants of
Magellan's poison gas in level 4...

79
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,510
This must be Magellan's poison!

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,350
Then we faced the Sphinx again in level 3!

81
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,810
Gnocchi!

82
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,570
You're still here?!

83
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,190
Penne! Buckwheat noodle with an egg!

84
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,070
Camisole!

85
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,360
Long johns!

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,910
T-back!

87
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,490
--Pantyhose!
--Briefs!

88
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,290
And we pretended to be a part of the
floor to trick the wild beasts just now!

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,800
We were pretty much the comic relief
but now we've made it all the way here!

90
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,130
To level 2!

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,970
Just a little more to go to get out of here!

92
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,060
Are you guys ready?!

93
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,150
Anytime!

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,950
These copies of keys that
Brother 3 made by wax,

95
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,910
they're fine pieces of work!

96
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,830
--Go to level 4!
--What's wrong, A team?

97
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,240
--Get B team!
--We lost touch with C team!

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,790
--Hurry up! What're you doing?
--Answer me!

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,330
What?! Vice Warden, this is
the monitoring room!

100
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,630
What's wrong?!

101
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,630
It's weird...

102
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,840
What?!

103
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,340
No, no, this cool headdress is...

104
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,220
...something that I ordered secretly
to wear when I became the warden....

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm not talking about that!

106
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I see somebody sneaking around level 2!

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,520
They look like prisoners!

108
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,530
What did you just say?!

109
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,860
Thanks!

110
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,950
You gotta thank Captain Buggy for this!

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,500
Send the remaining guards there to check!

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Yes, sir!

113
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,010
Are there any jailers on level 2?!

114
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,420
Answer me if you're still there!

115
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,760
--Yes?!
--What are you guys doing?!

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,970
We were gonna go down to level 4 as ordered.

117
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,560
No, inspect that floor!

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,060
This floor?

119
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,330
This is our time, partner!

120
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,250
While they're having a riot here again,
we're gonna stow away on a Navy ship!

121
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,290
Yeah, then our prison break will be complete!

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,460
I think that Straw Hat and
Mr. 2 are already dead...

123
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,550
...or they will spend the
rest of their life in prison!

124
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,850
But my own life is the one I saved!
-- I feel very sorry for them!

125
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,190
That's Buggy the Clown!

126
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,850
Look! There's Mr. 3, too!

127
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,270
Look up!

128
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,730
Up?

129
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,540
All right, guys! This is our big chance!

130
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,960
If you wanna get back on the
street, go berserk for your life!

131
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,920
Now let's kick it off!

132
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,710
--He's our savior!
--Captain Buggy!

133
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,460
T-This is level 2!

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,470
The prisoners are out of their
cells and rampaging again!

135
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,190
Send the Blugoris back! It's out of control!

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,390
Snap!

137
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,060
This is level 4!

138
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,270
--What now?!
--The queen of queers Ivankov and Inazuma...

139
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,780
...and Mr. 2 who tricked you earlier are...

140
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,400
Heehaw!

141
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,200
Gimme a break!

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,540
--They're here with a mob!
--A mob?!

143
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,170
Everyone, get down to level 4
now! Everyone, get down to...

144
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,800
I can't believe this but the
people that they're with...

145
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,730
...are the prisoners who had disappeared
by "Demoning Away" over the years!

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,350
What?! What's really going on here?!

147
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,400
It's for sure!

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,990
Somebody tell me if I can
still become the warden!

149
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,030
Heehaw! Finally, I caught up with you!

150
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Straw-chan!

151
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,120
Bon-chan! Looks like you
got your juice flowing now!

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,250
Yeah, I'm more than fine now!

153
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,370
No! Why are you here, Mr. 1?!

154
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,590
Who is it?

155
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,850
He's the guy who was defeated
by Sash-chan in Alabasta!

156
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,310
ONE

157
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,270
Oh, then I don't know him.

158
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,070
Vice Warden, we need backup on level 4 now!

159
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,950
We need it on level 2, too!

160
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,870
What should I do?

161
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,280
--Please hurry!
--Please hurry!

162
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,870
--Hannyabal-sama, give us an order!
--We need it on level 4!

163
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,920
--No, on level 2!
--Vice Warden, give us an order now!

164
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Emporio...

165
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,300
...Face Growth Synthesis!

166
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,430
Heehaw!

167
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,350
So annoying!

168
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,850
Hell Wink!

169
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,190
We can't stop them!

170
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,900
They were all vicious
before they disappeared...

171
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,120
...but now they're very bizarre!

172
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,880
Fish-Man Karate!

173
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,340
Arabesque Brick Fist!

174
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,600
Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!

175
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,360
For lots of reasons--we can't stop them!

176
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,200
Let's get to the Navy Headquarters!

177
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,750
We've had word of an unprecedented
riot going on in Impel Down.

178
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,920
The ringleader is Monkey D. Luffy.

179
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,440
This is your last chance to see the sky.

180
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,570
Once you've been shackled on the
scaffold, you will never again...

181
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,730
...see the sky.

182
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
This is Onigumo.

183
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,630
Prepare to open the gate of Marineford!

184
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,530
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

185
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,820
How did it go?

186
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,120
We still can't find him! Ace's
execution is in 5 hours...

187
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
NAVY

188
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,370
...so time is of the essence because
Whitebeard could appear at anytime!

189
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,960
But we can't find the Warlord of the Sea,
\ Blackbeard, anywhere on this island!

190
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,630
And maybe this is unrelated but
a Navy ship without clearance...

191
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,860
...has just arrived at Impel Down!

192
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,220
What?!

193
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,810
I don't think that it's him but...

194
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,380
Why did he come here?!

195
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,620
Search the ship they arrived on!

196
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes, sir!

197
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,170
Please wait! We didn't ask
for reinforcements and...

198
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,320
...there's a state of emergency here
so we can't assure your safety!

199
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,930
We're waiting to hear from
the Headquarters now so...

200
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,720
It doesn't matter! We're on the same side!

201
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,350
But even so, pirates are not
allowed to enter the prison...

202
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,500
There's no need to hesitate!

203
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,550
I'm...

204
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,630
...on the Government side!

205
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,510
What a gloomy place!

206
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,230
Sir! All crew members of the ship--
that Blackbeard was on are wiped out!

207
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,690
What?!

208
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,320
Hey!

209
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,070
Yes, sir!

210
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,240
Stop there!

211
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,750
Liberation!

212
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,600
We have an intruder! The Warlord
of the Sea - Marshall D. Teech!

213
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,620
Hey, you alright?!

214
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,450
They're the ones who vanished a while back!

215
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,360
Darkness...

216
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,500
Blackbeard and his clan are breaking
into the prison! This doesn't look good!

217
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,710
I was dragged into the darkness!

218
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,140
His motive is unknown!

219
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,180
Give us an order! H-Hurry!

220
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,730
It's over! My life is over now!

221
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,020
No, this is just a beginning!

222
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,450
A sad and long life in which I
will never become the warden...

223
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,200
...has just begun!

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,830
Vice Warden! Are you okay?!

225
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,470
Straw Hat on level 4!

226
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,110
Buggy the Clown on level 2!

227
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:27,750
MAIN ENTRANCE

228
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,750
The Warlord of the Sea--Blackbeard
at the main entrance!

229
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,320
I don't know...

230
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,090
...how to begin to deal with this mess!

231
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,510
IMPEL DOWN'S EXCLUSIVE PREMIUM
"FRIED RICE CRACKERS"

232
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,100
Anybody want snacks?

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,470
Are you nuts?! We gotta save Impel Down!

234
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,980
Ring, ring, ring...

235
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,080
That's easy for you to
say! You're not in charge!

236
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,900
--I see! You wanna become a vice warden!
--Hannyabal!

237
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,980
Can you hear me?!

238
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,820
W-Warden Magellan?! Where are you now?!

239
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm on level 2.

240
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,070
I've just taken care of the
fools running wild here.

241
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,850
Huh?!

242
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,290
Help me!

243
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,800
I blocked all the exits on this floor!

244
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,470
All of them will stop moving soon!

245
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,260
We're blocked up!

246
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,010
Captain Buggy! There is a
block of poison in our way!

247
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,650
Damn Magellan! How annoying!

248
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,440
We can't stay here!

249
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,400
I don't know why Blackbeard
is attacking us...

250
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,910
--...but I already did something about it.
--Nice!

251
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,580
It's not something that I wanted to do but
I have no option under the circumstances!

252
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,790
It's not something that you wanted to do?!

253
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I decided to release Shiryu against my will!

254
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,880
You did?!

255
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,180
Anyway, we can't ask the Navy
Headquarters for reinforcements.

256
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,590
We have to handle this ourselves!

257
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,770
You focus on bringing the situation
on level 4 under control!

258
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,650
I'm gonna head down to level 4 soon!

259
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,750
Hold out until I'll get there!

260
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,290
Warden!

261
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,660
Warden!

262
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,910
Warden!

263
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,480
Hey, Warden! Hey, Warden! Hey, Warden!...

264
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,010
Can we go now?

265
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,880
Fever!

266
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,260
Heehaw!

267
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,950
Crab-chan! Where is the
staircase to level 3?!

268
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,790
Go left! And across that bridge!

269
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,410
Got it!

270
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,330
Get out of my way!

271
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,730
PRISON

272
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,230
Light.

273
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,280
Yes, sir!

274
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,240
A JAIL MANAGER OF IMPEL
DOWN SHIRYU OF THE RAIN

275
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,210
Shiryu, how do you like it out of the cell?

276
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,920
Yeah, I really learned a lesson.

277
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,550
The eternal boredom makes you long for death.

278
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,810
But you're not gonna use me as a pawn

279
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,340
and then ask me to go back into
the cell, are you, Magellan?

280
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,240
You're a condemned prisoner! And
this is a deferred sentence!

281
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,000
This is your only chance!

282
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,900
Yeah, I bet.

283
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,280
I'll keep that in mind!

284
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,530
Here's your sword, Jail Manager Shiryu.

285
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,030
I'll leave Blackbeard to you!

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,710
Yes, sir!

287
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,870
Clank!

288
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,800
Oh my sword!

289
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,350
I haven't seen it for a while!

290
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,330
I have the right...

291
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,750
...to cut you down!

292
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,340
With the Blackbeard pirates having invaded,
Impel Down spirals further into chaos.

293
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,340
Blackbeard and the others manage
to evade the traps set out for them.

294
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,560
Meanwhile, the man freed
by Magellan stands in their way.

295
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,680
On the next episode of One Piece!

296
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,640
"The Dangerous Encounter! Blackbeard
and Shiryu of the Rain!"

297
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
