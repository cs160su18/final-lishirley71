00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660
Make waves, jump from your sleep

Being brazen, is it a crime?

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,850
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,520
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,610
and boarded the newly coated Sunny
setting sail for the Fish-Man Island...

80
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,490
...located 10,000 meters below the sea level...

81
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,580
...in order to go on to the
next stage - the New World.

82
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,710
Okay, that's good!

83
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,120
That's the extra-vehicular Flutter Kick Coating!

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,880
An extra-vehicular diving suit!

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,590
Wait! You have to attach the safety rope!

86
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,430
Rocket Launcher!

87
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,810
Another arm!

88
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,770
Guard Boost!

89
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,110
Are you guys okay?

90
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Mil Fleurs!

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,490
Gigantesco Mano!

92
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,370
They did great.

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,580
Alright, it's my turn!

94
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:44,550
"Lost in the Deep Sea!
The Straw Hats Get Separated!"

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,090
Third Gear!

96
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,360
Armament; Hardening!

97
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,580
What is that?!

98
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,000
It wasn't like that before!

99
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,050
I feel weak because of the sea!

100
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,800
Damn that octopus! Is it trying to stop him?

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,590
Blue Walk!

102
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,510
Whoa, Sanji-san got out of the bubble!

103
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,140
That's really fast!
He's like a Fish-Man! That's so cool!

104
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,830
I've been running and running

105
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,770
in order to get away from those hideous people for 2 years.

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,200
Compared to them,

107
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,440
the monster is nothing.

108
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,080
It actually looks rather cute to me.

109
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Diable Jambe!

110
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,290
Bien Cuit...

111
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,590
...Grill Shoot!

112
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,520
I need to breathe!

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
Three-Sword Style technique;
Crossing the Six Paths!

114
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,140
The demon that rules the
realm of water... So weak!

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,090
I feel grateful when I think about it.

116
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,440
I got to fight every single day for the past 2 years.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,520
To top him...

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm still gonna get stronger!

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,940
That was great...

120
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,150
I-I couldn't see his movement!

121
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,280
He shouldn't have done it!

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,080
Did you say something, No. 7?

123
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,080
--I'll kill you!
--Bring it on!

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey hey, Zoro! Sanji! You can't cut his arms!

125
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,500
Gum-Gum...

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,010
...Elephant Gun!

127
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,190
He blew it away!

128
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,940
He's gotten so much stronger!

129
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,690
Even while he's in the sea...

130
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,410
Hey! Something is in there!

131
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,870
A shark?

132
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,590
--A shark?
--Isn't that shark wearing something?

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,800
That's fairly big.

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,930
What is it?

135
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,560
Thanking us for helping him?

136
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,430
What a polite shark.

137
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,110
What?

138
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,940
We're being drawn into the sea current!

139
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,070
Luffy, let's go back to Sunny!

140
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,570
Yeah!

141
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,130
They've been swept away
by the downward current!

142
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh no! Follow them! We have to stay together!

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,970
Okay!

144
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,520
--I don't wanna die here!
--You've got to be kidding me!

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,430
--You're still here?
--You're too calm!

146
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,110
My eyes are spinning! But I don't have eyes!

147
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,720
Keep the yard level! Hard to Port!

148
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,630
We're gonna crash into the continental shelf!

149
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,740
I got it!

150
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,580
Don't lose your concentration,
or the ship will wreck!

151
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,450
What?!

152
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,170
Don't get thrown off!

153
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,960
Stay in the center of the current!

154
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,500
Alright!

155
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,770
It's really fast!

156
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,980
This is fun!

157
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,580
Usopp!

158
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,340
Oh, ow, ow, ow!

159
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,380
I'm alive!

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,020
What? Why are you all so glum?

161
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,980
Oh I know! You guys can't
do anything without me...

162
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,360
It's so cold here!

163
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,280
We can't find Luffy and the
other two. We got separated.

164
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,820
What?!

165
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,570
I hope they haven't been
shredded to pieces by the monster.

166
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,530
Your imagination is terrifying...

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,350
It's too dark - I wanna look for
them but I can't see anything!

168
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm not good with darkness.
I feel something, don't you?

169
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,070
We probably submerged around 7,000 meters.

170
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,070
Even the Shark Submerge can't
take the pressure this deep.

171
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,290
Are we near the Fish-Man Island?
Maybe they got there already...

172
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,750
Camie-chan said it's located
at 10,000 meters below sea level.

173
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,460
We have to submerge 3,000 meters more?!

174
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,380
All they have is a small bubble.

175
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,300
Even if they're alive,
there isn't enough air so it's dangerous!

176
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,680
That's why I told them to
attach the safety rope!

177
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,060
We won't accomplish anything
standing around like this.

178
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,230
Let's look for them. I now have a search light.

179
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,350
What?!

180
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,440
Is it your eyes?!

181
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,610
Franky...

182
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,780
...Nipple Lights!

183
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,410
Why there?!

184
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,370
Oh?

185
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,870
Th-That's huge!

186
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,540
Terrifying!

187
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,210
No way...

188
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,170
That's...

189
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,130
Let's get away!

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,430
Just look all around.

191
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,390
They must be looking for us too.

192
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,740
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

193
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,240
Where did you go?

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,030
Come back!

195
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,620
Luffy-san! Zoro-san! Sanji-san!

196
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,370
Dammit!

197
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,260
In this vast, submerged expanse,
the Sunny Eyes don't help that much.

198
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,380
We're stuck...

199
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,550
The darkness is stirring up our anxiety.

200
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,310
In fact, we're not getting
anywhere. What should we do?

201
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,940
We can't stop the ship so try
not to overlook anything.

202
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,190
There should be some trace of them.

203
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,690
Let's find them.

204
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,030
Yeah.

205
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,280
Oh, it's a jellyfish! There's a
massive jellyfish above us!

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,450
That's huge! You're right!

207
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,750
They're twinkling! Like stars in the night!

208
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,840
That's beautiful!

209
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,710
Oh, a tentacle!

210
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,470
D-Do you wanna be my friend?

211
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,590
Don't touch it, Chopper!

212
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,800
It's probably venomous!

213
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
Oh no! A little...

214
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,150
...Coup de Burst!

215
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,940
Wh-What?!

216
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,200
The jellyfish got eaten!

217
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,030
Oh, we lost some air.

218
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,450
Better than getting eaten!

219
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,870
Coup de Burst is a weapon that
shoots a fair amount of air.

220
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,630
But since we're in the water,
we only have a limited amount of air.

221
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,260
So when we shoot the air
out, the bubble shrinks!

222
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,510
I see. But it makes me nervous
to see the bubble shrinking.

223
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,850
That fish that got bitten
turned upside down!

224
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,850
So they contain a neurotoxin as I thought.

225
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,440
The deep sea's scary! It's dark too...

226
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,780
There are a lot of fish with
white eyes... It's creepy here!

227
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,110
Since the deep sea is always dark,

228
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,230
there are many creatures with rudimentary eyes.

229
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,230
So they can't see well.

230
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,770
Fools! See this? Come here!

231
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,150
But there are some with developed eyes too.

232
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,830
What's that? How can I see things without eyes?

233
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,620
Do you people wanna know why?

234
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,090
The answer is... Tum, tum, tum, tum, tum...

235
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,550
...a secret!

236
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,220
Are you talking to yourself?

237
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,100
No problem. I'm used to being lonely.

238
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,560
Hey! Stop fooling around and look for them!

239
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
Why did I get hit?

240
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,820
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji! Where are you?!

241
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,990
Oh?

242
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,910
This rope must be...

243
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,280
Everyone.

244
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,710
Have you seen that pirate guy?

245
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh yeah, he's still here!
I totally forgot about him.

246
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,550
Where did he go?

247
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,670
I haven't seen him since we got this deep.

248
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,880
Maybe he got thrown off
during the downward pull.

249
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,180
That could be it!

250
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,020
His hands and legs were tied up so
he couldn't hold on to anything.

251
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,640
Well but...

252
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,190
...he untied himself. See?

253
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,490
Th-Then, he's somewhere
on the ship? Where is he?

254
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,030
He's got to be hiding somewhere...

255
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,490
What?!

256
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,530
Oh no...

257
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,250
I'll sneak into the girls' room--
if that's what you want, honey.

258
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,490
Damn! We have enough problems already

259
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,170
but now we have to look out for him too.

260
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,840
Who cares! He's not that strong anyway.

261
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,150
It's great.

262
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:34,440
Those formidable 3 who were fighting
against the Kraken went missing.

263
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,820
There's no way they could have
survived after getting lost

264
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,580
with just those bubbles to protect them.

265
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,800
It's a shame that I couldn't kill Straw Hat

266
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,720
but I can prove that he's dead by killing

267
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,480
these crewmembers and taking their heads.

268
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,810
But don't rush, Caribou!

269
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,390
You can't rush!

270
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,070
If I kill them here, there's no one else to sail the ship.

271
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,780
They navigate the ship pretty well.

272
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,200
As soon as you get to the Fish-Man Island,

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,700
you all will be dead!

274
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,350
Here he is!

275
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,940
--Oh no! Shoot! Dammit!
--Now he can't get away.

276
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,900
How did he get in there?

277
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,780
We weren't paying attention. If he
wasn't so stupid, we could be in danger now.

278
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,580
His body wasn't taking form.
It has melted like mud.

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,370
--Like mud?
--Yeah, I'm sure it's a Devil Fruit power.

280
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,790
He must've eaten a Logia-type fruit.

281
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,380
He was only pretending to be caught.

282
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Hey, get me out of here, mister!
Mister in swimshorts!

283
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,050
I'll become your servant!

284
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,480
What's the matter, Chopper?

285
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,060
I don't know. I feel hot all of the sudden.

286
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,690
I can't stand the heat.

287
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,910
It's hot! What happened?

288
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,660
Wh-What's this? Smoke?
It's blocking our view forward!

289
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,830
Smoke from the sea floor? Why?

290
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,330
It's...

291
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,040
It could be...

292
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,300
Hydrothermal deposits!

293
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,100
--A volcanic area in the sea!
--What?!

294
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,310
Look, you can see that there
were volcanic eruptions here!

295
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,150
Let's get away from here!
If it erupts, we're gonna die!

296
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,360
It's hot... It's hot...

297
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,110
Something's after us!

298
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,910
Carnivorous Tubeworms!

299
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,740
We have no choice.

300
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,490
A little Coup de Burst!

301
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,170
Faceless Crabs!

302
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,380
A little Coup de Burst!

303
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,920
I don't even know what they are!

304
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
A little Coup de Burst!

305
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,090
The deep sea's scary!

306
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,060
Luffy and the others can't survive here.

307
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm starting to get sad.
I finally got to see him after 2 years...

308
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,940
Cut it out! They're not gonna die so easily!

309
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,610
I used Coup de Burst little by
little but we lost so much air.

310
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,080
What is that?! It's so bright!

311
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,340
Is that the Fish-Man Island?

312
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,160
Do you think Luffy and the others are there?

313
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,250
We haven't submerged
another 3,000 meters yet.

314
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,170
"WHO-ARE-YOU?"

315
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,760
Hey! What are you sending
the flashing signals with?!

316
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,760
--Do you see anything?
--No, it's still too bright.

317
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,350
Oh no!

318
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,850
It's an angler! He tricked us!

319
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,940
We were fooled by the deep-sea hunter!

320
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,860
That was close!

321
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,410
We're totally trapped! Can we get away...?

322
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,370
What is it this time?!

323
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,790
I-Is it a human?

324
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,750
What the hell is it?!

325
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,010
A monster in the sea that looks like a man...

326
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,930
It's a Sea Bonze!

327
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,600
He's gonna capsize the ship!

328
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
That?!

329
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,650
Hey, Ankoro! You can't do that!

330
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,120
Don't eat ships! How many
times do I have to tell you?

331
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,410
Captain Vander Decken-sama won't like this!

332
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,210
D-Did he help us?

333
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,920
Let's go! We have to get away
anyway! He is a monster too!

334
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,890
What the hell is that?!

335
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,840
The infamous ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman,
emerges from the dark.

336
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,930
But suddenly, a submarine volcano erupts,
creating yet more danger.

337
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,770
Evading falling rocks,
they make it to the ocean floor,

338
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,140
where a scenery not expected
in the Deep Sea awaits them.

339
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,590
On the next episode of One Piece!

340
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,890
Undersea Volcanic Eruption!
Drifting to the Fish-Man Island!

341
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
