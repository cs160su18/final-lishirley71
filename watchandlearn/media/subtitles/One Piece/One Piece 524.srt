00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
It's not our way to worry

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,900
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,900
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,570
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago
to go on to the next stage the New World.

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,750
Let's go to the Fish-Man Island!

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,250
There's something at 6
o'clock! Is it a creature? No...

82
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,800
Are you guys all ready?!

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,640
--Yes, brother!
--Yes, yes!

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,050
The target is right there!

85
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,230
Hey, guys! There is a ship kind
of thing coming from behind!

86
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,890
Charge!

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,400
It's a pirate ship!

88
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:31,790
"Deadly Combat under the Sea!
The Demon of the Ocean Strikes!"

89
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,580
Run!

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,210
Hard to port!

91
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,470
Go, Sea Cow!

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,020
--They're coming after us!
--That sounds so familiar...

93
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,600
They're so persistent!

94
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,890
What do they want from us?

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,030
Stop!

96
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,480
The bubble is gonna pop!

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,780
--You're doing great, Sea Cow!
--Yes!

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,370
--Are they gonna come aboard?
--Sea Cow?

99
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,740
Wait a minute! That's...

100
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,250
The bubbles are joined!
Brother, now is the chance!

101
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,880
--Alright, should we do it?!
--Yes!

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,760
Hey, Momoo! You're Momoo of the
Arlong Pirates, aren't you?

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,510
Do you remember me?

104
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm Nami! I was there at the Arlong Park!

105
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,810
Hm? Hey, Luffy, doesn't he look familiar?

106
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,150
Yeah?

107
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,520
Die, you damn thing!

108
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Gum-Gum Pistol!

109
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,160
--Let's board their ship!
--Yes!

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,410
Whoa! He's coming through the bubble!

111
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,210
No, somebody's coming!

112
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,000
We gotta fight!

113
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,670
--Guys! Are you ready?!
--Yes!

114
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:14,600
While they're dumbfounded,

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,140
kill them all!

116
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,690
Let's go!

117
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,770
Yes!

118
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,900
Guys, follow my lead!

119
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,530
What?!

120
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,620
--What's the matter, Sea Cow?
--Why, Sea Cow?

121
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,710
--Oh no, we left Captain Caribou on that ship!
--Brother!

122
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,010
Alright, by way of greeting,

123
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,640
fire the gatling gun!

124
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,890
Kill all the Straw Hats and...

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,780
Huh?

126
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,760
No! Don't throw me out into the water!

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,090
That's something...

128
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,600
...you shouldn't do!

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,350
You have to value people's life!

130
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,190
The gods... the gods are watching
over you! Don't you think so?!

131
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,060
You're being inconsistent!

132
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,570
Weren't you gonna fire a
gatling gun and kill us all!

133
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,620
No, that was just... That
was just a play on words.

134
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,160
That wasn't playing.

135
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,660
Who are you? You must be
the captain of the ship.

136
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,830
Oh, Roronoa Zoro!

137
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,340
No way! I'm not a captain! I'm just...

138
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,430
I was forced to be a slave for them!

139
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,890
Oh, I'm sick of being on that ship!

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,640
He's making ridiculous excuses.

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,300
Oh yeah! This is great!

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,770
Can I stay on this ship for a little while?

143
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,900
Please?

144
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,440
Well, he is kind of pathetic...

145
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,150
No way! He just made it up!

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,570
What?! He just made it up?!

147
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,780
Hey, where did you find the Sea
Cow who was drawing your ship?

148
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,740
Oh...

149
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,870
Here is... mmm... Cutie-san!

150
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,040
You're the cat burglar.

151
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,090
Stop looking at our navigator like that!

152
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,930
Nami-san! You're safe...

153
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,680
...now!

154
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,180
That's getting to be a pain!

155
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,980
I just caught that sea monster somewhere...

156
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,860
Experienced people have
those animals pull their ship.

157
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,190
What?!

158
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,280
Is that so?

159
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,200
--Stop! Stop, Sea Cow!
--What happened?

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,870
Brother! I'll save you!

161
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,210
I wanna find a sea monster.

162
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,220
Hey, Luffy! What are you up to?

163
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,050
Oh, it's just a turtle... It's too small.

164
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,430
Come on!

165
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,520
Let's start his rehabilitation
with some less stimulating pics.

166
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,070
Hey, Nami.

167
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,960
The direction we're heading is slightly off

168
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
from where Log Pose is pointing.

169
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah, that's fine.

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,070
The right course should be south
west of where it's pointing.

171
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,820
It's faster to go straight.
Why should we do that?

172
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,250
If you go straight, you'd be
taken away by the sea current

173
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,710
and get stuck by an undersea
mountain or volcano.

174
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,380
What?! Volcano! It's
scary to be in the water!

175
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,420
But I thought the sea currents
in the Grand Line were volatile.

176
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,720
Is there any stable current?

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,930
Yes, just one.

178
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,680
This is good. Stay calm.

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,740
Everyone! It's gonna get
colder from here on out

180
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,730
so wear a coat or something.

181
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,900
Yes, it's getting chilly
- I can feel it on my skin.

182
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh, but I don't...

183
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,530
You're a skeleton--you don't have skin.

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,990
Chopper-san, you can't do that...

185
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,750
You can't steal my line...

186
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,000
Are we going somewhere
cold? Not the deep sea?

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,540
Don't you know that the
water in the deep sea is cold?

188
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,760
Like in a bath tub, hot water
goes up and cold water goes down.

189
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,010
Oh yeah? I'm not a big fan of
baths so I wouldn't know.

190
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,630
I see.

191
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,850
If the sea is the same as a bath tub,

192
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,910
it's gonna get colder as you go deeper.

193
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,810
The temperature isn't the only difference.

194
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,900
You're still depressed?!

195
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,310
In the deep layer of the sea,

196
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,360
there are giant currents
called deep currents

197
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,450
that you don't get to see very often.

198
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,620
Those currents flow totally
independently from surface currents.

199
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,410
There are currents under currents?!
You know many things!

200
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,540
Because I'm really old!

201
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,300
All currents are connected.

202
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,590
One current flows eastward and
the other one flows westward.

203
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:46,430
They could also flow upward or
downward. It's like a giant dragon.

204
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,930
Deep currents flow really slowly.

205
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,440
Once they flow to the deep
sea, it takes 2000 years...

206
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,650
...until they flow upward to the surface.

207
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,240
2000 years?!

208
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,950
Yes, that's why there
are a number of myths...

209
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,410
about the dark and
undiscovered deep currents.

210
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,580
Monsters! Curses! Spirits of the dead!

211
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,210
What?! There are ghosts in the deep sea?!

212
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,300
--Huh? Really? I'm scared!
--It's exciting!

213
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,180
Ghosts... I don't know about that.

214
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,520
But we're gonna get on a downward flow.

215
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,650
That's how we get to the deep sea.

216
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,150
Deep layer...

217
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,860
Surface...

218
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,900
Downward flow...

219
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,280
Submerge...

220
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,990
Twang-twang!

221
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,330
So there are wonderful currents...

222
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,250
You guys didn't understand a bit, did you?!

223
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,750
You wanna sing, Nami-san?

224
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,710
Shut up!

225
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,050
What is that sound?

226
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,430
This is it!

227
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,350
Nami, I see it!

228
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,270
Yeah?

229
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,140
The wonderful current?!

230
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,480
Where is it?

231
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,690
That's cool!

232
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,530
--Oh!
--What is that?

233
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,110
So that's the downward current!

234
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,070
The downward flow--plume!

235
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,330
How... cool!

236
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,450
It's like a massive...

237
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,420
...waterfall in the sea!

238
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,520
Interesting!

239
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,610
The sea is "falling" far below!
At an extraordinary speed!

240
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,610
Nature's great!

241
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,620
What a spectacular stream!
I wonder how deep it is.

242
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,330
It's far greater than I had heard.

243
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,500
I can't see the bottom! It's completely dark!

244
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,490
We're dead!

245
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,440
With that speed,
we're gonna be slammed

246
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,130
into the bottom and die!

247
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,590
Is it really okay to go with the flow?

248
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,640
Don't worry about the ship.

249
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Sunny is the strongest ship built
from the treasure tree Adam.

250
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,020
Alright!

251
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,350
Advance!

252
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,570
No way!

253
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,860
I didn't know that it lives here...!

254
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,790
It's a demon that rules the realm of water!

255
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,010
And the enemy of the human race!

256
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,030
Straw Hats! You should turn back now!

257
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,830
It's dangerous!

258
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,660
I had forgotten about you.

259
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,410
--There is a monster!
--What?!

260
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,130
What are you talking about? Cut that crap!

261
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,770
Those myths are just made up by someone.

262
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,870
It... It's right there...

263
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,490
Cut it out, guys!

264
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,330
B-Behind you...

265
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,330
What are you saying...

266
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,050
Be... Behind me?

267
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,720
Uh-huh.

268
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,010
Behind me...

269
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,940
It's the Kraken!

270
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,610
How huge!  The monster octopus!

271
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,030
Looks like he broke a lot of ships!

272
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,410
Ships that had left for the
New World have been attacked!

273
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,910
Please! I don't wanna die! Go back!

274
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,580
If you just wait for a few days, it would...

275
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,500
Shut up!

276
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,920
I have a good idea!

277
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,710
Let's tame him!

278
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,920
Huh?

279
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,590
What did you say, Luffy?!

280
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's tame the octopus
and make him pull our ship!

281
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,850
No way!

282
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,270
Take a good look!

283
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,810
No, you don't have to take
a good look since it's huge!

284
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,230
Oh, it's big!

285
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,690
We're dead!

286
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,780
It must've been around for
several hundred years!

287
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,040
The Kraken appears in many
myths in the world -

288
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,290
it's like a visionary creature!

289
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
It has no bones and I'm a
skeleton without any flesh...

290
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,130
It's the polar opposite of me.

291
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,290
I don't care!

292
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,630
You're quite good.

293
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,130
You can't see this kind of thing often, so...

294
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,840
Sketching? How relaxed?!

295
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,640
I'll help you but do you
have any plan, Luffy?

296
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
The problem is that we're in the sea.

297
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,310
No. No. No.

298
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,290
The problem is the size of it.

299
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,610
It would be dangerous
even if we were on land.

300
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,450
What's wrong with them?

301
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,610
This is the kind of situation
when everybody agrees to

302
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,450
run away at full speed!

303
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,700
Shift the helm to the south!

304
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,670
Hey, Nami, go straight towards the octopus!

305
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,130
Don't be a fool!

306
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,550
--The octopus will...
--Whoa, whoa, Nami-san. I'm here for...

307
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,510
...here for...

308
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,300
...for you!

309
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,560
You held it! Good job!

310
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,640
Thanks to the rehabilitation
and to Nami for wearing a coat.

311
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,600
It's dangerous to be on this ship!
I've got to protect myself!

312
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,860
Something's coming from behind!

313
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,860
Brother!

314
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,740
They came back!

315
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,240
Coribou! Guys!

316
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,200
--We're gonna save my brother!
--Yes!

317
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,420
You came back to save me, huh?!

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,460
Don't do it!

319
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,560
--The coating popped!
--That ship is even bigger than Sunny!

320
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:34,310
Oh... Guys!

321
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,160
--They look like a school of jellyfish.
--Shut up, Roronoa! Cut it out!

322
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,410
It's coming!

323
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,670
--It's too big!
--How can we fight against it?!

324
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,000
Third Gear...

325
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,380
No!

326
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,670
You'll break the bubble!

327
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,510
Chicken Voyage!

328
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,930
Can we... get away somehow?!

329
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,140
Don't do anything! I'll beat it!

330
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,310
No! You're gonna break the bubble!

331
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:20,490
Listen! If you wanna fight against
it that much, here is an idea!

332
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,490
What is it? Tell me.

333
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,820
Okay, that's good!

334
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,420
That's the extra-vehicular
Flutter Kick Coating!

335
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,040
An extra-vehicular diving suit!

336
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:39,840
As long as you're in it, you can
fight as you want even in water!

337
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,090
If I let these fools do whatever
they want, I'll be in danger too!

338
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,630
You shouldn't have done that, stranger!

339
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,100
We wanted to run away!

340
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,440
Now, they're gonna fight!

341
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,850
I told you guys to run from the beginning

342
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,020
but that Captain-san won't listen!

343
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,650
Would you rather they fought on this ship?

344
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,900
Okay, good luck! Go far away!

345
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,240
This rope is annoying.

346
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,870
Stay away from this ship!

347
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,910
Alright.

348
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,040
--Okay, let's go!
--Yeah!

349
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,870
Huh?

350
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,340
Wait! You have to attach the safety rope!

351
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,920
You'll be separated!

352
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,260
Nami-san's worrying about me!

353
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,720
You guys! Draw his attention for me!

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,970
I'm gonna beat him with one strong blow!

355
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,310
I could beat him right away!

356
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,190
You can't cut him!

357
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,770
I want the octopus as a pet!

358
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,320
Are they okay?

359
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,110
Stay as far away as you
can! Even a millimeter...

360
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,030
But it's attacking us!

361
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,830
Move aside, guys!

362
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,450
Franky...

363
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,380
...Rocket Launcher!

364
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,260
--Got it!
--How powerful!

365
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,640
No, another arm!

366
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,260
Why does he keep attacking us?!

367
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,470
It's gonna hit us!

368
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,810
Guard Boost!

369
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,730
They got a hard hit!

370
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,650
Are you guys okay?

371
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,070
H-He did it!

372
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,650
--Well done!
--Yeah, Chopper!

373
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,030
We're gonna hit the mountain!

374
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,000
Mil Fleurs!

375
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,210
Gigantesco Mano!

376
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,000
What big hands!

377
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,340
--Yes!
--Nice, Robin! You saved us!

378
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,250
Good. Although I'm in water,

379
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,980
I was okay because it
was just a brief moment.

380
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,940
They did great.

381
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,150
Alright, it's my turn!

382
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,940
Here is the new technique!

383
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,360
Third Gear!

384
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,160
Facing the Demon of the ocean floor, Kraken,

385
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,420
Luffy, Zoro and Sanji use the techniques

386
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,610
acquired during their two-year training.

387
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,140
But then, the Straw Hats are
scattered in the Deep Sea

388
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,930
by the massive current caused by the battle.

389
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

390
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,570
"Lost in the Deep Sea!
The Straw Hats Get Separated!"

391
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
