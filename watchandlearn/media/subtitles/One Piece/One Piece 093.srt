00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,800
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,510
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,600
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,280
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,580
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,170
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,380
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:21,100
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,430
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,310
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,490
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,670
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,420
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,970
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,280
Well, we're finally here.

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,790
I'd tell you not to be too eager,
but I guess that's asking too much.

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,480
But do you have a plan
for stopping the rebellion?

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,940
I do have a plan, but there's no
guarantee it will make things stop.

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,210
So hungry...

26
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,230
So hot...

27
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,250
Please! Don't make a hasty decision!

28
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,260
"Nanohana, Alabasta Kingdom"

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,190
"Off to the Desert Kingdom! The Rain-
Summoning Powder and the Rebel Army"

30
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,370
So this is an Alabasta city?

31
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,110
Food!

32
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,030
Listen, guys! Use self-control and
try not to act on instinct too much!

33
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,210
Yes, Nami-san!

34
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,000
The guy who needs to hear
that the most is already gone.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,740
Food place!

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,020
Get back here!

37
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,010
He's all-instinct.

38
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,890
What should we do?

39
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,100
Don't worry.

40
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,340
Find where the most commotion is,
and he'll be there.

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,730
You got that right.

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,290
Ugh! I wish he'd at least realize
he has a bounty on his head!

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,590
Especially in a big country like this!

44
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,910
Forget about him.
Let him do whatever.

45
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,880
Let's just eat first.
We can think after that.

46
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,790
They're all the same...

47
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,790
Karoo and I can't go with you.

48
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,240
--Eh?
--Huh? Are you not feeling good?

49
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,790
I'm too recognizable here...

50
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,000
That's for sure.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,290
Don't worry! I'll go shopping
for you too, Vivi-chan!

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,670
What is it?

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,180
Mr. 3's ship!

54
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,190
That creep didn't kick
the bucket after all?!

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,400
There's no doubt about it!

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,790
His ship runs on the power
of his Wax-Wax Fruit!

57
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,320
The bastard's here?

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
This is bad. He's seen our faces.

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,940
It's alright! I have an idea!

60
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,300
There's no telling where he is,
so we hafta move without standing out.

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,690
I think we're standing out quite a bit...

62
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,920
Alright! You can come out, guys!

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,670
We've been long out.

64
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,180
Looks like nobody noticed us!

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,130
If so, it's a miracle.

66
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,520
Vivi-chan. We're safe from
view for a little while now.

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,810
Vivi-chan?

68
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,660
Yes?! Yes? You were saying?

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,740
What's wrong?

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm sorry. I just felt
a little relieved, so...

71
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,020
At the very least,

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,490
from what I've seen of this town,
things still seem all right...

73
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,070
I probably can't rest easy...

74
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,440
...but I think I'll make it in time.

75
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,300
Yeah. It does seem like a peaceful town.

76
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,220
Hey, Vivi.

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,550
You said you had a plan for
stopping the rebel army, right?

78
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,900
What will you do now?

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,260
What should we do?

80
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,390
Eh?

81
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,790
If you think you're gonna make it in
time, it'd be better to act quick.

82
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,440
Th-That's true, but the agreement
was only to bring me to Alabasta--

83
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,990
Come on, now!
Are you still saying that?

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,110
Nami-san?!

85
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,780
We traveled this far together.
We can't just leave you now.

86
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,910
Yeah, Vivi! Don't act so distant!

87
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,680
Plus, I'm interested in this
Warlord of the Sea!

88
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,930
You don't have to mention that!

89
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,830
Anyways, stop thinking that way!

90
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,000
Not to mention people are
out to kill all of us but me.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sanji-san...

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,750
So there you have it!

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,170
And besides, if this
country gets destroyed,

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,930
we won't get our reward
for bringing you here.

95
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,800
Understand?

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,590
Y-Yes.

97
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,010
Very good, then!

98
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,210
Go to hell.

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,480
Thank you, Zoro! I haven't forgotten
about your debt to me, either!

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,270
Wh-Why, you--!

101
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,150
Even if I'm a ghost I'll
still come for my money!

102
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,360
You lousy--!

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
You'd better pay the
400,000 Berries you owe!

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,610
It's gone up!

105
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,990
It'll go even higher if
you're not quick to repay!

106
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,340
Hey, Usopp! Say something!

107
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,340
Thank you.

108
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,230
Forget it!

109
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,810
Nami-san is in the right!

110
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,770
Say what?!

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,840
Northwest of this city
is an oasis called Yuba.

112
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,860
That's where the rebel army is based.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,570
I'd like to go there
first to stop the uprising.

114
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,230
But to get to Yuba,
we'll have to cross the desert.

115
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,610
For that, we'll need to stock up on
the necessary food and water here...

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,430
...but if Mr. 3 is in town...

117
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,920
Oh. In that case, it's no problem.

118
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,970
He hasn't seen my face.

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,360
That's right! You've met
almost none of them so far!

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,220
And one other!

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, yeah! Chopper, too!

122
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,800
That'll be perfect. We'll have a
lot to carry. I'm counting on you!

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,310
Right! Got it!

124
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,090
Hey, now. You gonna be okay?

125
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,270
I'll be okay! I wanna do what I can!

126
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,580
There's no problem like this, right?

127
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,020
Alright! Now that's a human reindeer!

128
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,380
In that case, your help is appreciated.

129
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,530
Leave it to us!

130
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,010
I've listed everything we need.
Oh, and we'll need some clothes, too.

131
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,680
Clothes?

132
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,640
Ordinary clothes so we won't stand out.

133
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,070
--Ah.
--And perfume!

134
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,100
--Ah.
--And perfume!

135
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,180
Yes, Nami-san!

136
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,990
Food and water!

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,470
Tabasco!

138
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,320
Who cares about you!

139
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,010
Food and water!

140
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,750
Tabasco!

141
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,850
Still...

142
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
...where could that idiot be,
and what is he doing?!

143
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,160
Hmm... It doesn't look like there'd
be a food place here at all...

144
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,210
But, actually...

145
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,740
...where am I?!

146
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,080
"Nanohana"

147
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,540
No choice. I'll just have
to go back the way I came.

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,780
Smoke?

149
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,510
If there's smoke, that means...

150
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,820
Food place!

151
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,050
Says it's deer meat!

152
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,120
That's what's great
about historical lands!

153
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,630
Got all kinds of ingredients!

154
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,700
What is it, Chopper?

155
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,720
There's something strange mixed
in with the smell of the food...

156
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,210
Strange?

157
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,330
Oh! That's the scent of perfume!

158
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,340
Perfume?

159
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,420
Yeah. That shop there sells some.

160
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,010
I don't really like this smell... Hey!

161
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,210
That's a wonderful outfit, Miss!

162
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,680
But it and your exotic fragrance
are put to shame by your raw charm!

163
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,860
What do you say?
Would you like to have some tea--?

164
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,010
What was that, Chopper?!
That was just getting good!

165
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,110
What are you doing?
Shopping comes first!

166
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,820
Yeah, I know!

167
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,360
Oh, it's too much!
This smell is making me sick...

168
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh, that's okay. Don't push yourself.

169
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,950
I'll do the shopping.
You go wait over there.

170
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,980
Later!

171
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,990
Miss!

172
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,130
Is he really gonna be okay?

173
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,060
This is bad. I'm starting to
have symptoms of heat stroke.

174
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,750
I need to go somewhere where it's cool...

175
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,860
Ah! That feels nice!

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,280
I think I'll take a nap until
Sanji comes back.

177
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,910
Is that okay? Is it? I guess it is...

178
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,790
Is it closed?

179
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,290
Yeah. Let's go.

180
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,060
We don't want anyone finding it.

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,790
Now where'd he go?

182
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:35,670
"Katorea"

183
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,560
Nanohana is famous for its perfume,

184
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,820
but the perfume is actually
made at an oasis called Katorea.

185
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,670
It's a city west of here.

186
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,700
I dunno, this doesn't seem like
a food place at all, but...

187
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,870
Anyone here?!

188
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Huh? No one's even here?

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,540
Oh! Water!

190
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,750
Come on! Just a little would be good!

191
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,290
What're these?

192
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,040
What's this green powder?

193
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,440
Is it food? It doesn't look very tasty...

194
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,110
Yuck! Yuck! What is this stuff?! Blech, yuck!

195
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,110
Oh! Perfect!

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,920
This stuff is obviously poison!

197
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,310
Now you burn!

198
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,120
What a waste of time that was.
Now to find me a food place...

199
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,380
What is that?!

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,060
Rain...

201
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,730
Oh! This is perfect! Water!

202
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,110
Wh-What is this?!

203
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,940
Aah! All the bags are gone!

204
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,670
What the hell did you do?!

205
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,400
Who are you?

206
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,990
Shut up!

207
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm asking what you did with that powder!

208
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,740
Powder?

209
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,900
I burned it all!

210
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,210
You burned it?!

211
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,970
My Dance Powder! My treasure!

212
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,640
What's with you, old guy?
Why're you so sad?

213
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,810
Shut up! How dare you
waste my prized powder!

214
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,330
Do you know how much I spent for it?!

215
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,050
I don't care! Why would you
want that poison anyway?!

216
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,820
That's none of your business, you bastard!

217
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,770
Give me my dream back!

218
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,300
That stuff was your dream?!

219
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,080
That's right! It was a step
toward achieving my big ambition!

220
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,740
I'm very sorry!

221
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,830
Apologizing won't fix things!
Pay me for it!

222
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,370
I can't. I don't have money.

223
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,200
Don't say that proudly!

224
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,560
I even built a cabin out here and
finally managed to get this far...

225
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,210
C'mon, don't be so down!
You can just buy some more!

226
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,840
It's not that easy to buy!

227
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,600
The World Government outlawed
it from being made or sold!

228
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,500
Come again?

229
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,290
Hey, old man.
Are you a really bad guy?

230
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,430
You found me out?

231
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,180
Then die!

232
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,610
Huh?! Where am I?!

233
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,660
Huh? Huh? Who're they? Where am I?

234
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,540
Rifles!

235
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,820
What's wrong?

236
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,680
Thought I heard a voice. It's nothing.

237
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,730
I dunno what's going on,
but they seem dangerous!

238
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,160
I should probably get out of here, quick!

239
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,730
Oww!

240
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,950
Good work. That took a while.

241
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,950
Yeah.

242
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,330
The weapon store guy really raised
his prices, that greedy bastard...

243
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,580
It can't be helped. They're in huge
trouble if they get found out, too.

244
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,370
Where's Koza?

245
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,830
Inside.

246
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,500
We got a bit of food, too.
It's in the back.

247
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,380
Got it.

248
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,920
What is this?

249
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,640
They went and bought a whole deer?

250
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,520
Koza. We got some weapons.
Just a few, anyway...

251
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Yeah. Sorry for giving you
such a dangerous job.

252
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,600
It's nothing at all.

253
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,280
Why're you in such a daze?

254
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,700
This country is screwed...

255
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,350
It'll either collapse from the inside, or...

256
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,330
Whatever the case, it won't stay at peace.

257
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,630
We have enough men now after
300,000 of the Royal Army

258
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,680
switched to our side, but we
don't have enough weapons...

259
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,090
Or food.

260
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,930
And our strength is at its limit.

261
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,680
There's no point in shedding
any more unnecessary blood.

262
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,970
We're going to finish everything
for good with our next attack!

263
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,960
We, the rebel army,
must change this country!

264
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,970
Hey! Wasn't there deer meat here?

265
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,940
Huh? Are you sure someone
didn't haul it out already?

266
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,620
C'mon, do better checks, will ya?

267
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,470
What?!

268
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,900
Water? There's some in
that trough! Drink that!

269
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,670
Hey! Let's get the rest
out of here! Gimme a hand!

270
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,500
Right!

271
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,610
A-Am I safe now?

272
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,450
Whew! Thank you!

273
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,970
But why did you help me?

274
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,810
"I got no reason. I'm cool, ain't I?"

275
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,070
You're so strange!

276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,980
Thank you so much!

277
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,750
He's a little strange,
but he's a nice guy!

278
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,430
I feel like I'm going to see him again!

279
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,000
Still, who were those people?

280
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,790
Oh, well. Now which way is Nanohana?

281
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,540
This way.

282
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,520
Oh! You certainly are strong!

283
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,770
No one can beat me!

284
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,730
Yeah, I would think not!
Not with your strength! My apologies!

285
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,480
No, no! I apologize for
burning your important stuff!

286
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,520
Oh, uhh, no, let's just
call it a mutual apology!

287
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,110
In any case, please keep
this powder thing a secret!

288
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,410
Hey.

289
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,190
What was that powder?

290
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,540
Y-You don't know?

291
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,910
No. It was yucky.

292
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,700
That was stuff known as Dance Powder!

293
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,090
Dance Powder?

294
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,920
It's also called
"Rain-Summoning Powder."

295
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,550
It's what caused that
sudden downpour just now!

296
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,050
Umm, shall I explain in more detail?

297
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,310
I wouldn't understand anyways!

298
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,060
You look like you wouldn't.

299
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,560
You're a rude guy!

300
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,970
I-In any case, this powder can
artificially produce rain, yes.

301
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,110
Dance Powder, when released into
the air, forms the cores for rain!

302
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,280
When moisture collects around them,
clouds form and precipitate!

303
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Understand?

304
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,150
So it's mystery powder, basically?

305
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,410
Well done!

306
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,150
You really are a rude guy!

307
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,630
Why would you wanna use
that powder to make it rain?

308
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,800
You don't seem to know
anything about this country.

309
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,040
No. I just landed here by boat.

310
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,430
This land of Alabasta has always
been battling with drought.

311
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,430
Drought?

312
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,890
It's when it never rains
and the land dries up!

313
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,670
I know that much!

314
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,440
So anyway, this land has
always been low on water.

315
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,270
And rain's been especially
scarce these past few years.

316
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,320
That's really something!

317
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,690
Most oases have dried up now!

318
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,760
Huh? Then just use the mystery powder!

319
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,740
Exactly! But the World Government
has outlawed Dance Powder!

320
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,580
They'll execute you if
they catch you using it!

321
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,210
It's also said to be what
started this country's rebellion.

322
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,290
Really?

323
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,910
I don't know much myself, though.

324
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,580
Oh.

325
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,180
Oh! Was your dream to use that
mystery powder to save this country?

326
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,100
Huh?!

327
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,230
You said it was important powder earlier.

328
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,020
No, uhh, that wasn't quite
what I had in mind...

329
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,850
What, then?

330
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,860
Well, I thought I could
make a bunch of money

331
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,780
by selling water in these hard times...

332
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,190
Yeah, you could! You're smart!

333
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,370
But, whatever. That has
nothing to do with me.

334
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,320
Guess I'll keep looking
for a food place again.

335
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,200
U-Umm! Please, don't
tell anyone about this!

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,460
I won't. I don't care.

337
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,700
I beg you! I'll give you whatever I can!

338
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,000
--For reals?!
--For real! For real!

339
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,930
Oh! Thanks for this lunch, old guy!

340
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,260
Not at all! I hope it's to your liking!

341
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,680
It's more than enough! Later, old guy!

342
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,790
Please remember not to tell anyone!

343
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,500
Don't worry! Don't worry!

344
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,060
I couldn't turn you in,
even if I wanted to!

345
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,140
Huh?

346
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,740
After all, I'm a pirate!

347
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,720
See ya! Thanks for the food!

348
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,110
That isn't fair!

349
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,560
Wow!

350
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,520
This is wonderful!

351
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,400
I love these kinds of clothes!

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,920
I know I asked you to
shop for us Sanji-san,

353
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,700
but aren't these outfits
for dancer girls?

354
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,410
Come, now! It looks marvelous on you!

355
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,210
I asked for commoner clothing...

356
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,210
Dancers are commoners, too!

357
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,100
But we're going to cross a desert...

358
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,260
Don't worry!

359
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,550
If you get tired, I'll carry you!

360
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,370
There's no getting through to him...

361
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,320
But, compared to them,
you two clearly look like bandits.

362
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,030
How're you any different?!

363
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,380
Chopper! What're you doing?

364
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,400
The smell is killing me...

365
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
That reminds me, where did you go?

366
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,990
Various places!

367
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,220
Is he not feeling good?

368
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,860
Oh, the perfume's gotten to him.

369
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,660
Perfume?

370
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,900
Oh, right! Tony-kun
has a sensitive nose!

371
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,380
Oh, this...

372
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,160
Some of it can be rather strong.

373
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,520
Like this?

374
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,600
Stop!

375
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,050
Mellorine love into the abyss!

376
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,050
What are you, an idiot?

377
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,960
In any case, we've accomplished our
first goal of gathering supplies!

378
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,020
Yes...

379
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,670
We're going to a place
called Yuba, was it?

380
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,260
Yes, but first is a
trek through the desert.

381
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,710
It will likely be much more difficult
than you imagine right now.

382
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,240
There's no telling what might happen.

383
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,160
One wrong step in this burning land,

384
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,690
and there's no guarantee you'll survive.

385
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,350
I'm still a little uneasy and unsure
about taking you to such a place,

386
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,000
but I want to return peace to this kingdom!

387
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,840
So I... So I ask you again!

388
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,250
Everyone! Please lend me your help!

389
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,080
I beg of you...

390
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,850
You finally said it.

391
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,790
We've been waiting for it!

392
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,110
There's no telling what happens on
the sea, either. Right, Vivi-chan?

393
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,770
Yeah! It'll be no different from before!

394
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,310
I can't wait to see the desert!

395
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,370
Alright, guys! Whadya say
we get going to Yuba now?!

396
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,630
Yeah!

397
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,200
Everyone...

398
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,370
Don't we seem to be missing someone?

399
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,410
Luffy!

400
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,030
This won't be enough at all!

401
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,360
That moron!

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:24,380
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

403
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:36,960
From today forth,
something's going to change

404
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:47,220
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

405
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:57,640
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

406
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:08,110
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

407
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:16,500
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

408
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,170
Before dawn

409
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,630
Where in the world could Luffy have gone?

410
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,090
Uh oh! Hide! It's the Navy!

411
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,640
What's all the commotion?
Did something happen in town?!

412
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,390
Some idiot pirate must
be running around town.

413
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,470
Heya, guys!

414
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,720
It's you?!

415
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,980
Yikes! It's that copycat girl!
Crap! I'm outta here!

416
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

417
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,650
"The Heroes' Reunion!
His Name is Fire Fist Ace!"

418
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
