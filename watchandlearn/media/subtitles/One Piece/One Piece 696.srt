00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,170
Oh

35

Here we go, always, be the best

Here we go itsudatte saikou de

Beyond the light, make my day

69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,270
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,430
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,650
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,490
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,250
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,570
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

84
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,500
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

85
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Gravity Blade!

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,290
Raging Tiger!

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,220
This jerk! What is he up to?!

88
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,190
It's an all-or-nothing gamble.

89
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm determined to bet my life on it.

90
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,370
Father-sama must be
somewhere on this battlefield, too...

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,800
Somebody made it here, huh?

92
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,060
It's you...

93
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,980
We can go straight to the fourth level this way!
Let's go, Tra-guy!

94
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,070
Go!

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,660
I'm gonna go first!

96
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, wait, Soldier!

97
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,580
Luffy, dodge!

98
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,000
Let me take care of it!

99
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,910
Hey, Bartolomeo!

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,680
If it helps Luffy-senpai...

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm happy to die!

102
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,560
I know how you feel...

103
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,240
Rooster-kun.

104
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,320
Our captain is...

105
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,900
...worth risking...

106
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,870
...even our lives!

107
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,230
"A Tearful Reunion!
Rebecca and Kyros!"

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Damn!

109
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,980
I gotta hurry or
Soldier will kick Mingo's ass first!

110
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,060
Straw Hat-ya!

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,260
What?!

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,650
It's still here!

113
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,320
It's no use fighting it!

114
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,240
We're almost at the fourth level!
Shake it off!

115
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,490
Okay!

116
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,310
THE PLATEAU - LOCATION OF THE ROYAL PALACE - LEVEL 4
THE SUNFLOWER FIELD

117
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,670
What did you come here for?!

118
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,720
Don't tell me you're here to kill Doffy.

119
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,430
That can't be it.

120
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,730
You recklessly challenged me
with that blunt-edged sword

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,110
and disgraced yourself pathetically!

122
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,780
So you know you have no chance against Doffy!

123
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
Or...

124
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,870
...you came to challenge me again
believing in some miracle?

125
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,180
To avenge your mother...

126
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,060
...on me!

127
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,070
I like the look in your eyes.

128
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,420
I... I couldn't protect her!

129
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,810
Sure! If you wanna challenge me,
I accept!

130
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,740
Listen to me, Rebecca!

131
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,200
I promise I'll kick Doflamingo's ass for you!

132
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
Shame on you, Rebecca!

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,830
What's the matter?! Why are you running?!

134
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,420
Why aren't you fighting?!

135
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,920
You're a gladiator!

136
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,420
I thought you came to kill me!

137
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,870
I know I'm no match for Diamante.

138
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,000
What I have to do now is
hand this key over to Lucy and the others!

139
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,010
At the Colosseum, I managed to put on
some good shows using you but...

140
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,900
...if you can't fight,

141
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
you've served your purpose!

142
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,630
I'll... put an end to you now.

143
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,260
No, wait...

144
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,320
You prefer a gun, don't you?

145
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,450
Because Scarlet...

146
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,900
...got killed by a gun!

147
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,360
Help!

148
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,720
Soldier-san!!

149
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,140
Rebecca!!

150
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,640
You're...

151
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,810
Kyros!

152
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,730
Won't let you take away...

153
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,360
...another member of my family
from me!!

154
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,130
This man was a legend.

155
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,750
He was the strongest gladiator
in the history of the Colosseum.

156
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,520
Although I couldn't protect your mother,

157
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,050
I'm gonna protect you to the end,
with my life!

158
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,900
Let me teach you how to fight.

159
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,070
My mother said I shouldn't hurt anyone!

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,910
I'm gonna teach you how to not get hurt!

161
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,020
I'm a toy.

162
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,220
Rain and wind will rust my body!

163
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,420
I don't know how long my body's gonna last!

164
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,390
Be strong!

165
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,750
Rebecca!

166
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,140
Father-sama...

167
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

168
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,760
As a toy with no future,

169
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,350
all I could do was teach you how to fight!

170
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,830
Even though you're a gentle person
like your mother!

171
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,630
But it ends today!

172
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,500
What?

173
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,800
You...

174
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,700
...don't have to fight anymore.

175
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,280
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

176
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,290
Uh-huh!

177
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,880
What do you mean by that, Kyros?!

178
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,680
It means, today,

179
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
I'll settle my score with all of you!

180
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,060
That means...

181
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,440
...it's the end of all of you!

182
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,390
You monster!

183
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,190
Rebecca!

184
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,680
Is this...!

185
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,330
Rebecca!!

186
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,390
Lucy!

187
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,150
Rebecca!!

188
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,190
The key!

189
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,490
Lucy!

190
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,700
Great! We both made it!

191
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,670
The key!

192
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,420
Give it to me now!

193
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,840
Here it is!

194
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,180
Hurry up!

195
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,390
Rebecca!

196
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,710
Room!

197
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,090
You jerks!

198
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,900
Here they are.

199
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,430
Finally, we caught up with him!

200
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,810
Finally... I'm free!

201
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,300
We're here!
The fourth level - where Mingo is!

202
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,300
Is that where he is?

203
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,380
Yeah.

204
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,630
Law! Straw Hat!

205
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,130
Diamante.

206
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm sorry, you two...
My hands are full with this guy.

207
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,060
Could you take care of Doflamingo for me?!

208
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,230
Of course!

209
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,130
Then, I'll leave that guy up to you, Soldier!

210
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,270
Got it!

211
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,200
--Let's go, Straw Hat-ya!
--Okay!

212
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,040
Oh yeah, Rebecca!

213
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,870
I bet you're happy to see your dad!

214
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,540
Uh-huh.

215
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,390
Thank you for the key!

216
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,320
See you!

217
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,630
Hey, Lucy!

218
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,290
Are you really going to...

219
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,190
Are you really going to
take down Doflamingo?!

220
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm not Lucy.

221
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,850
My name is Luffy!
The man who'll become the King of the Pirates!

222
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,340
So don't worry!

223
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,490
The King of the Pirates?!

224
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,700
You're fighting me, Diamante!

225
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,550
Don't get in my way!

226
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,420
What annoying bastards!

227
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,170
I won't allow you idiots...

228
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,550
...to get to the Palace!

229
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,720
You tremendous idiot! Traitorous brat!

230
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,410
Room!

231
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,600
Shambles!

232
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,320
Dammit!!

233
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,810
Is this... the palace?

234
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,610
Yeah, we finally made it.

235
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,420
What a useful ability!

236
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,160
It is but it also eats up my energy.

237
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,160
Maybe, having those Sea Prism Stone cuffs on

238
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,430
and getting carried by you to this
point wasn't so bad after all.

239
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,370
I was able to save my energy.

240
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Scalpel.

241
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,670
What's wrong?!

242
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,490
I operated on myself.

243
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,170
He purposely used lead bullets...
That jerk!

244
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,820
You okay?

245
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,720
--No need to worry.
--I see.

246
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,720
All right!
Let's go and kick Mingo's ass!

247
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,680
Wait!

248
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,550
What?!

249
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,800
Doflamingo isn't someone that you can
beat just by force of will alone.

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,650
You need to cool down.

251
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,900
What?! How can I cool down
after getting this far?!

252
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,730
I'm saying, if you don't,
you can't defeat him!

253
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,390
I promised Rebecca!

254
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,400
Stopping here won't change anything!

255
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,790
Law and Straw Hat have shown up
in the yard...

256
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,180
...nearby the pool.

257
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,270
--Roger that.
--Clank.

258
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,480
10 years... For 10 years.

259
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,970
I spent such a long time,
increasing their number little by little.

260
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,700
Those tens of thousands of toy slaves.

261
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,620
But that idiot...

262
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,300
...brought it all to naught in an instant!

263
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,620
Not yet, Kanjuro?! We have no time!

264
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,510
It's almost done!

265
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,980
Revenge is easy.

266
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,080
Just touch them with this hand.

267
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,740
Straw Hats...

268
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,990
Now I'll bring...

269
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,340
...your existences...

270
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,900
...to naught!

271
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,680
A vengeful Sugar closes in on Luffy and Law.

272
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,050
"Won't let her turn him into a toy!"

273
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,290
With this passionate thought in his mind,

274
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,800
Usopp takes aim at Sugar in the distance,
beyond even his line of sight!

275
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,030
Suddenly, everybody's fate depends on
Usopp's skill!

276
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

277
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,940
"One Shot One Kill! The Man
Who Will Save Dressrosa!"

278
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
