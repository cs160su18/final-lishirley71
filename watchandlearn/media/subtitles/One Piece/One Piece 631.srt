We are the one! Go ahead!

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,220

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,620

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,360

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41

and become the King of the Pirates!

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,070
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,640
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,910
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,690
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,030
The Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

74
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,230
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

75
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,430
and were drawn into a climactic
battle on Punk Hazard

76
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,230
which ended with Caesar's capture.

77
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,340
Then, they headed out for
their next destination

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,190
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law.

79
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,550
We made it! Dressrosa!

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,390
Luffy and the others arrived at Dressrosa -
a kingdom ruled by Doflamingo,

81
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,200
and divided into three teams.

82
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,040
The first team will head for
Green Bit to hand over Caesar.

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,790
The second team will stay at
the Sunny to guard the ship.

84
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,200
The third team will...

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,570
...destroy the SMILE factory
and rescue a samurai.

86
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,600
Luffy and the others entered
a port town - Acacia

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,010
where they came across living toys.

88
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,780
Then, they walked into a bar to eat something.
However...

89
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,520
Let's go this way!

90
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,800
How does it go? What is it?

91
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry! It's black!

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,620
You were off!

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,410
Okay, white!

94
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,010
Let's see.

95
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,650
You've missed it again. It's black 20!

96
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,550
It should be white this time!

97
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,850
It's black!

98
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,330
White!

99
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,590
I'm sorry!

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
It's black!

101
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,680
I guess I'm running out
of luck. This is no good.

102
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,830
What do you wanna do? Do you wanna quit?

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,240
No.

104
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,680
One last time.

105
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,610
I bet everything!

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
Great!

107
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,950
Then I'm gonna bet everything
on whichever color you don't pick.

108
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,790
Let's play it like real men!

109
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,760
Everything? Really?

110
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,140
Yeah.

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,990
Alright, let's do it.

112
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,200
Place your bets!

113
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,270
I've made up my mind.

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,910
White, please!

115
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,180
"Full of Enthusiasm!
The Corrida Colosseum!"

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,900
If you pick white, I bet on black, of course!

117
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,930
Okay.

118
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Come on, white! White!

119
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,600
It's gonna be black! Black!

120
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,230
Which is it?!

121
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,720
You're not saying anything. That means...

122
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,280
...it's white, isn't it?!

123
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,250
I'm sorry, old man!

124
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,290
What?! That means it's...

125
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes!

126
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,540
--It's bl...
--White!

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Ah?! Who the hell are you?!

128
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,590
Look carefully! It's black, idiot!

129
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,590
It's white.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,990
Old man, you win!

131
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,720
What?!

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,180
You bastard! Stay out of it!

133
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,220
That's right!

134
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,660
Do you wanna get your ass kicked?!

135
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,880
Who is he?

136
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Doesn't he have any idea who they are?!

137
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,580
He got himself involved, as usual!

138
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,780
How annoying!
He looks so calm and composed!

139
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,520
D-Do I really win?!

140
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,420
Yeah, you win.

141
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,650
I don't know who you are
but thank you for your kindness!

142
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,590
Don't mention it. I just said what I saw.

143
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,490
I'm happy for you.

144
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,160
But, old man, you look so strong...

145
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,170
What you're doing is so senseless, you brat!

146
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,340
When we say "It's black," it's black!

147
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,070
He can't see anyway so it doesn't matter!

148
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,560
You're so annoying!

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,010
Go away!

150
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,530
Oh no, did I trip a big boar or something?

151
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,050
If so, I'm sorry.

152
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,490
Y-You fool!

153
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,540
This is no good.

154
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,580
Young man, could you step aside a little bit?

155
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,360
I'm going to send those people to hell.

156
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,960
Kill him!

157
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,290
What?!

158
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,680
It's heavy! So heavy...

159
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,610
I-I'm going to get crushed!

160
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,380
What?! What's wrong with him?!

161
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,810
What did he do?!

162
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,120
Wow! It left a hole!

163
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,120
It's not too bad to be blind.

164
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,700
I know there are many hideous things
that are better unseen.

165
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,610
Okay, excuse me.

166
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,250
Who is he?

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,710
Is he a Devil Fruit eater?

168
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,930
What kind of Devil Fruit is that?

169
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,870
Excuse me, mister.

170
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,550
You can send a bill for the repairs here.

171
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,510
O-Okay...

172
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,070
Wh-What?! Don't tell me you're...

173
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,240
Goodbye.

174
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,460
Old man, you're so strong! Who are you?

175
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,100
I should not tell you that
for the sake of both of us.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,230
Hey, are you blind?!

177
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,340
I-I'm sorry. Did you get hurt?

178
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,220
"For the sake of both of us"?
Is he extraordinarily infamous or something?

179
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,390
Whoever he is, he is not an ordinary man.

180
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,160
--Oh, my bag is gone!
--So is my watch!

181
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,860
I can't find my wallet!

182
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,960
Oh no! My jacket got stolen, too!

183
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,860
In broad daylight,
while there was dust everywhere...

184
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,670
That old man was a thief?

185
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,170
There are only two!

186
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,610
What's the matter?

187
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,370
One of my swords is missing!

188
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,080
My Shusui that was here a minute ago!

189
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,010
What?! The national treasure
of the Wano Kingdom?!

190
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,460
Damn! My Shusui...

191
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,380
Where did it go?!

192
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,670
What are you gonna do?!

193
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,640
They stole from everybody.

194
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,140
It was fairies who took your stuff.

195
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,690
What are you talking about?!

196
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,840
Is that the name of a group of thieves?!

197
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,180
Fairies are fairies.
All you can do is laugh it off and let it go.

198
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,650
How can I laugh it off?!

199
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,600
Those invisible fairies are
the guardian deities of

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,950
Dressrosa from ancient times.

201
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,900
We have to turn a blind
eye to whatever they do.

202
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,730
Well, if fairies did it...

203
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,000
We should just forget about it!

204
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,100
I can't just let it go!

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,290
He's right!

206
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,220
The sword is the national
treasure of the Wano Kingdom!

207
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,040
That's my sword!

208
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,770
It's not yours!

209
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,610
I told you! Somebody gave it to me!

210
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,150
I'll have to challenge you
to a duel at some point

211
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,510
and win the Shusui back for the Wano Kingdom!

212
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,100
Yeah, I'll accept it and defeat you!

213
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,620
You got too greedy, fairy!

214
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,090
You can't get away!

215
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,960
Hey, Zoro! Where are you going?!

216
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,260
Wait, wait!

217
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,030
We don't have time to let you wander!

218
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,590
Sounds like fun!

219
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,670
Wait, Luffy!

220
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,650
Did you find the thief?!

221
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,490
I'm not gonna let anybody
have the national treasure!

222
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,810
Hey, let go of me! We should go, too!

223
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,420
I have an idea.

224
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,270
An idea?

225
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,930
I understand now.

226
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,130
When there are only these guys around,
I have to take charge.

227
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,230
Boy, they're all out to get attention?!

228
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,640
Leave everything up to this big brother.

229
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,160
There it is! Wait, you fool!

230
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,660
You wait, you idiot!

231
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,140
Give me back the national treasure of
the Wano Kingdom!

232
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,810
Wait!

233
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,440
You wait!

234
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,050
Give me back the national treasure of
the Wano Kingdom!

235
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,050
Look! He has a strange hairstyle!

236
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,710
What did you say?! How rude!

237
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,460
I didn't know my topknot was exposed!

238
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,290
Oh no! I'm not a child but...

239
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,990
...I'm lost!

240
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,310
You're working under Doflamingo, aren't you?

241
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,450
Yeah. So what?

242
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,020
Super that's what we thought!

243
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,980
Yeah.

244
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,060
Do you guys think
you can mess with the Young Master-sama

245
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,160
in Dressrosa and get away with it?

246
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,140
That's not gonna work for us.

247
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,410
Old buddy, why don't you spit it all out -
everything we just asked you...

248
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,050
I-I told you!

249
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,850
I remember going after a couple of samurai

250
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,490
but I don't know how one got captured
and where he is now.

251
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,250
And I don't know what SMILE is.

252
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,490
You don't even know a bit about SMILE?

253
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,440
Yeah, and I don't know the
factory you're talking about.

254
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,980
Who are you people?!

255
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,070
I can't believe this.
Even his man doesn't know about it.

256
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,510
Then tell us where people of higher rank are.

257
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,580
This guy is too low in rank maybe.

258
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,620
Everyone's too busy today -
I don't know where they are.

259
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,920
I've been summoned to the Colosseum, too.

260
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,300
Look!

261
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,180
All the people in this kingdom
are heading to the Colosseum today.

262
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,370
What Colosseum?

263
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,400
It's the Corrida Colosseum.

264
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,870
If you wanna see high-ranked
officials, go there!

265
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,940
Why are they going there?

266
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,850
There will be a very big event today.

267
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,420
All the executives of our
family should be there.

268
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,990
The very big event that you're talking about is
that super event?

269
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,000
For whatever reason, Young Master-sama
offered an unbelievable prize!

270
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,760
Oh, it was so surprising!

271
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,800
Everyone wants it!

272
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,070
D-Don't tell me it's...

273
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,970
...that delicious meat
that Mingo was talking about!

274
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,280
Huh?

275
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,030
He said he has something that you will want.

276
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,120
Then what is the prize?

277
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,370
Prepare yourself for the shock...

278
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,340
The prize is...

279
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,660
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

280
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,730
Ouch!

281
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,600
Here he comes! The Lightning Soldier!

282
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,390
You hurt me!

283
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,800
We want to see it, too!

284
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,710
Let us in!

285
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,410
It is not for kids to watch!

286
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,350
People will kill each other! Go home!

287
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,150
That's the wanted toy soldier!

288
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,420
He just won't give up!

289
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,820
You can't shoot me!

290
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,500
Jet Walk!

291
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,360
Ladies and gentlemen and toys!

292
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,170
What you will see today is...

293
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,830
...one hell of an event!

294
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,150
The king entrusted us
with an extraordinary prize...

295
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,150
...for today's event!

296
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,630
There was a man who died
in the War of the Best

297
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,270
in Marineford two years ago.

298
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,340
What?! He means...

299
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,680
He was a 2nd division commander of
the legendary Whitebeard Pirates

300
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,050
and a son of the King of the Pirates -
his name was Ace!

301
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,820
--What?!
--Ace?!

302
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,500
Flame Commandment!

303
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,690
Fire Pillar!

304
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,530
They say he could smash through a warship
with his Fire Fist

305
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,520
and could burn down a town,
turning it into hell!

306
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:12,680
That tremendous power is now
reproduced as a Devil Fruit!

307
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,380
--R-Reproduced?!
--For real?!

308
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,120
Look!

309
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,960
The winner will get this forbidden fruit!

310
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,790
It's Logia, the most powerful
type of Devil Fruit!

311
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,170
--No way!
--That's...

312
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,460
It's the Flare-Flare Fruit!

313
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,570
--Wow!
--I can't believe it!

314
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,160
Is it a real one?

315
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,630
Young Master-sama won't lie about this!

316
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ace's...

317
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,490
...Flare-Flare Fruit?!
