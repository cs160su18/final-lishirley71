00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,750
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,430
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,550
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,180
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,280
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,580
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,170
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:21,100
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,430
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,310
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:39,490
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,670
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,420
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,970
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:22,240
"Yuba"              "Nanohana"   "Katorea"

22
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,880
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,140
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,950
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,010
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,700
After arriving in Alabasta,
Luffy and the others

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,270
encountered Navy Captain Smoker.

29
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,880
There to save Luffy
in the nick of time

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,580
was the man who controls fire:
Fire Fist Ace.

31
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,410
Ace turned out to be
Luffy's older brother.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,350
"Ace and Luffy!
Hot Emotions and Brotherly Bonds"

33
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,520
Move.

34
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,190
I'm afraid that's a no-can-do.

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,270
Fire Fist Ace...

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,120
To think you're Straw Hat's brother...

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,810
White...

38
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,100
Spark!

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,870
Wh-What is that?!

40
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,100
--Is a house on fire?!
--No, it's no ordinary fire!

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,250
What in the world is happening?

42
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,580
It's a fight between flame and smoke?!

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,910
He did say he ate
the Flame-Flame Fruit.

44
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,680
But Luffy! Is it true
that guy's your brother?!

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,610
Yeah! His name's Ace!

46
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,180
You having a brother
isn't that surprising,

47
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,990
but what's he doing
in the Grand Line?!

48
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,940
Ace is a pirate!

49
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,920
He left the island three years
before me to find the One Piece!

50
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,360
A-Anyways, let's hurry back to the ship!

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's escape before
anyone comes after us!

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,380
Yes, Nami-san!

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,300
Still, I never thought I'd
see Ace in a place like this!

54
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,670
The path splits into two!

55
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,550
Usopp, left! Hear me, guys?!

56
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,890
Yes, Nami-san! I'll follow
you wherever you go!

57
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,200
Enough, pervy cook!

58
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,840
Cool! The fireball's gone even higher!

59
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,460
It seems there really is no end to
a fight between flame and smoke.

60
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,590
Though it was already obvious enough.

61
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,070
Where did Straw Hat's crew go?

62
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,240
Th-They're gone!

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,550
So is Ace! We've lost sight of him!

64
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,740
I caught Straw Hat for the
first time in the Grand Line...

65
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,570
But Portgas D. Ace.
You simply had to get in the way.

66
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,590
Hurry and load the stuff!
We're leaving right away!

67
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,620
Hurry!

68
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,820
Set the sails!

69
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,890
S-Say. Are we leaving again just
after we finally reached the island?

70
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,720
Yes. We only stopped by this town
to get what we're going to need.

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,420
Now we're going to head up the
river into the interior of Alabasta.

72
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,770
Our next destination is Erumalu,
the City of Green.

73
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,850
Erumalu?

74
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,670
Hurry!

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Pick up the pace!

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
All set!

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,090
Okay! Let's set sail!

78
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,040
Y'know...

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
Huh?

80
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,130
I get the feeling we're
missing someone...

81
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,800
So do I...

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,720
Yeah. We're missing
approximately one person.

83
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,660
That moron!

84
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,450
Huh?!

85
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,270
That's weird.

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,060
Why am I the only one here?

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,840
Where did they go?

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,990
Sheesh! I guess my letting you
escape was pretty much pointless.

89
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,110
Yo!

90
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,610
Ace!

91
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,270
Haven't seen you in a while, Luffy!

92
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,970
You too, Ace!

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,360
How many years has it been?

94
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,630
Good question.

95
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,300
But, Luffy. It looks like you
still go at your own pace,

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,340
just like you did
since you were a kid.

97
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,260
You too, Ace! I was surprised
you ate a Devil Fruit,

98
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,770
but besides that, you're the same!

99
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,980
Like when you'd sneak into the fields,
eat 100 watermelons,

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,770
and then spit the seeds
out like a gun and run!

101
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,310
That wasn't me! That was you!

102
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,110
And then you got big bumps right here!

103
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,920
That was you, too!
I watched and laughed!

104
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,520
I guess we're both the same!

105
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,530
Yeah!

106
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,470
This brings back memories!

107
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,250
Say, weren't your friends
looking for you?

108
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,790
Yeah.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,010
But, Ace. What are you
doing in this country?

110
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,490
Huh? You mean you didn't get
the message I sent to Drum?

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,750
Drum?

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,620
Yeah. It's no big deal
or anything, though.

113
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm just in these waters
on minor business,

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,620
so I thought I might look you up.

115
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,720
Minor business?

116
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,190
I'm a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates now.

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,230
Whitebeard Pirates?

118
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,160
This is the mark of the
Whitebeard Pirates. It's my pride.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,940
Oh?

120
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,380
Luffy. Won't you join
the Whitebeard Pirates?

121
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,030
Your friends can come too, of course.

122
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,080
No.

123
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,620
I figured not. Just thought I'd ask.

124
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,770
Whitebeard is the greatest pirate I know.

125
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,830
I wanna help him to be
King of the Pirates...

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,650
And not you, Luffy.

127
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,480
That's fine!
Then we'll just have to fight!

128
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,570
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

129
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,500
Hey! Don't drink it all, Luffy!

130
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,000
Something must've happened in town.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,290
Smoker and all the
marines left the ship...

132
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,090
But...

133
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,790
This is perfect! I'll use this
chance to escape somehow!

134
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,310
Mr. 11.

135
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,110
You must be members of Baroque
Works if you know my codename!

136
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,340
Are you Millions?! Hurry and untie me!

137
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,320
Yeah, we are members of Baroque Works.

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,400
But we're Billions. Meaning we're
candidates to be Number Agents.

139
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,790
Mr. 11. You're barely an agent.
You're not much stronger than us.

140
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,170
O-Oh! I see!

141
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,310
Sorry about that, Billions.
But could you hurry and untie me?

142
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,980
Don't be silly!

143
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,710
With you gone, one of us can
be promoted to a Number Agent.

144
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,600
So let's empty one of the Agents' seats!

145
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,790
W-Wait!

146
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,680
Hey!

147
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,790
Fire Fist Ace is in this town!

148
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,160
What?! Fire Fist Ace?!

149
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,070
The Second Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates?

150
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,510
If we can take down Ace,
we're guaranteed to be Number Agents!

151
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,220
Anyways, let's look for your friends.

152
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,800
Getting spotted by the
Navy's always a pain.

153
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,410
They might've gone back to the ship.

154
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,120
Which harbor is your ship in?

155
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,160
Actually, I can't remember at all.

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,790
Oh, geez.

157
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,150
Pirate ship captains usually
remember where they leave their ship.

158
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,550
Don't worry about it!

159
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,650
You are the same as ever.

160
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,490
Say, what kind of crew do you have?

161
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
A swordsman who wants to be the
world's greatest sword master.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,450
He's always wearing a haramaki.

163
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,620
A navigator who likes maps
and tangerines and money!

164
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,830
Then there's a cook who
makes really yummy food...

165
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,220
Oh, and there's a liar, too!

166
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,230
And then a reindeer!

167
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,510
That's quite the variety you got there.

168
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,650
We also have a princess and a duck now!

169
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,560
Oh?

170
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,900
They're all so interesting!

171
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,800
I'd say you're probably the
most interesting of all, though.

172
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,640
Still, only a handful of people for a
pirate crew... That's just like you.

173
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,360
I also want a musician!

174
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,100
Stop right there, Fire Fist Ace!

175
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,320
As you can see,
there's no place to run now!

176
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,900
Fire Fist Ace! Your head is mine!

177
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,980
Prepare yourself!

178
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,310
I-Is it really okay to
set sail without Luffy?

179
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,540
The Navy will be all over the harbors.

180
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,790
We need to hide the ship first.

181
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,530
There should be a cove ahead
that's hidden from view!

182
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,480
So we'll wait for things to
cool down, then look for Luffy.

183
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,460
Yeesh! He's always, always
causing trouble like this!

184
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,420
He's a real reliable captain...

185
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,810
Fire Fist Ace! Your bad luck ends here!

186
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,410
Hey! Isn't that Straw Hat Luffy?!

187
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,450
N-Now that you mention it--!

188
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,680
H-He's worth 30 million Berries!

189
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,000
Talk about lucky! Fire Fist Ace
and Straw Hat Luffy!

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,020
Once I have your heads, our promotion
is a hop, skip, and jump away!

191
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,220
Anyway, let's find your ship.
Let's go to the shore.

192
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,020
Yeah.

193
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,970
Hey, you!

194
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,290
Hold it right there!

195
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,090
Bastards!

196
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,100
Get them!

197
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,230
Take this!

198
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,710
What the--?! What the--?!

199
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,190
So sorry!

200
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,900
Hold the bastard down!

201
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,970
Wh-What the--?! His arms stretched!

202
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,650
He has Devil Fruit powers?!

203
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,200
Don't scare me like that, you jerks!

204
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,790
Gum-Gum...

205
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,300
Oww! Hot!

206
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,640
...Bazooka!

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,170
D-Don't let 'em scare you!

208
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,670
The rank of Number Agent
is riding on this!

209
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,940
After them!

210
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,910
Oh! The ocean!

211
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,370
See your ship?

212
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,800
There's no escape!

213
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,270
You guys just never learn.

214
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,660
Oh! There it is!

215
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,870
Hey! Over here! Guys!

216
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,740
Hey, Luffy. Go on--

217
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,180
Never mind.

218
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,450
Oh! There he is! It's Luffy!

219
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,030
I found Luffy!

220
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,720
You did?

221
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,660
Yeah. That stupid face is definitely his.

222
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,230
Huh?!

223
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,550
I'm back!

224
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,200
Sanji-san! Tony-kun!

225
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,550
Oh, come on!

226
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,740
Not again...

227
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,930
Sorry 'bout that, Sanji, Chopper!

228
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,900
Do you not know how to learn your
lesson?! I oughta gut you whole!

229
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,770
Yeah! Do you have any idea how
much trouble you've caused?!

230
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,960
Try to act somewhat like a captain!

231
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Sorry.

232
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,470
Oh, that's right! Ace!

233
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,870
Ace?

234
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,430
Your brother was with you?

235
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,540
Is it okay to just leave him there?

236
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,190
I guess he'll be okay! Ace is strong!

237
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,950
He's strong?

238
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,130
Yeah! He hadn't eaten the
Flame-Flame Fruit a long time ago,

239
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,400
but I still never beat
him in a single fight!

240
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,090
He's real strong, Ace is!

241
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,890
There's a flesh-and-blood
person you could never beat?!

242
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,430
I guess the big brother of a
monster is an even bigger monster...

243
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,690
That's right! I lost all the time!

244
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,050
But I'd win now if we tried!

245
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,130
I assume that's another groundless claim.

246
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,270
Who...

247
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,470
can win what now?!

248
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,260
Oh! Ace! This is the crew
I was talking about!

249
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,670
Oh! Thank you all for taking
care of my little brother!

250
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,110
Eh? Oh, not at all.

251
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,570
He might be a bit much for
you to handle too, but...

252
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,380
No, not at all.

253
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,980
Take good care of 'im.

254
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,600
You probably have lots
of catching up to do.

255
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Why don't you come in?
I'll make some tea.

256
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,790
No, uhh, that's okay.
Don't do it on account of me.

257
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,610
T-Talk about unexpected...

258
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,060
That's for sure.

259
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,650
I would've expected him to
be as reckless as Luffy...

260
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,950
No, this sensible man can't
possibly be Luffy's brother!

261
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,060
He's a nice guy who
cares about his brother!

262
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,500
Brothers can be so wonderful!

263
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,080
The sea is just full of surprises...

264
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,950
Come now, everyone!

265
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,030
See! Aren't these guys neat?!

266
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,550
Baroque Works!
Those are the Billions' ships!

267
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,520
Fire Fist Ace and Straw Hat Luffy!
Don't think you can get away!

268
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,170
We'll show you just what Baroque
Works' Billions are made of!

269
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,270
Those guys again?

270
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,110
Luffy. I'll clean them up.

271
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,770
Eh?

272
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,320
What's he going to do?

273
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,180
Especially in that little boat...

274
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,240
Let's see how skilled

275
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,660
this Second Division Commander of
the Whitebeard Pirates really is!

276
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,730
Here he comes! Fire Fist Ace!

277
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,330
Just try to get past five
of our ships, if you can!

278
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,210
He jumped!

279
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,340
F-Fire!

280
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,560
Shoot him into the ocean!

281
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,350
Fire Fist!

282
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,190
Whoa!

283
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,180
Captain Smoker!

284
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,070
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew
are nowhere to be found.

285
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,390
What do you think, Tashigi?

286
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,690
Vivi was with them.

287
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,480
Vivi? Princess Nefertari Vivi
was with the Straw Hats?

288
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,370
She must be a hostage.

289
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,990
They abducted the princess
for some sort of scheme...

290
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,460
No. Vivi was acting like
she was part of the crew.

291
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,160
The princess? Part of their crew?

292
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,530
Something really is
happening in this country.

293
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,930
Captain Smoker!

294
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,220
I'm sorry, sir!

295
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,600
Mr. 11 was done in by someone
while he was tied up on the ship!

296
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,270
We still haven't located
the Straw Hats, either!

297
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,050
No need to fret. I have a good
idea of where they're headed.

298
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,010
He's after Crocodile.

299
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,980
Crocodile?! One of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea,

300
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,540
the pirates given government approval?!

301
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,250
You know I hate the Seven Warlords.

302
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,540
Especially that detestable man.

303
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,960
B-But standpoint-wise,
he's a Navy and government ally!

304
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,710
He's always been a clever pirate.

305
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,710
He's never been the type to just
quietly obey the government!

306
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,670
Tashigi! All you need
to remember is one thing!

307
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,060
A pirate is a pirate,
no matter where he goes!

308
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,760
Straw Hat will show
up wherever Crocodile is!

309
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,980
Things should become
clear if we go there.

310
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,560
And next time, you won't
get away, Straw Hat!

311
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,430
Woohoo!

312
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,520
Ace is one of us now!

313
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,030
Cheers!

314
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,200
Who said I was joining you?

315
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,250
Here's to delicious drinks!

316
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,110
Cheers!

317
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,590
Don't worry about it!

318
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,510
They're always looking
for an excuse to drink to!

319
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,840
Medicine is horrible!

320
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,380
Ace! Are you sure you won't join us?

321
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,950
I'm chasing a certain man.

322
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,310
His name's Blackbeard.

323
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,900
Blackbeard?!

324
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
He's the pirate who
attacked the Drum Kingdom!

325
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,820
He used to be a member of the 2nd
Division of the Whitebeard Pirates,

326
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,740
one of my men.

327
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,580
But he committed the worst
possible sin on a pirate ship:

328
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,980
he killed a crewmember and jumped ship.

329
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,870
So, as the commander,
I gotta find and get rid of him.

330
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,560
So that's why you're chasing after him?

331
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,490
I came here because I caught word
that Blackbeard was seen in Yuba.

332
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,290
Then your destination
is the same as ours!

333
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,350
We've just entered the Sandora River.

334
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,400
First, we'll land at Erumalu, then
head into the interior of Alabasta

335
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
to reach Yuba here!

336
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,190
The leader of the rebel army is in Yuba.

337
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,750
I see. So you're headed to Yuba next.

338
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,030
I'll follow Nami-san and
Vivi-chan wherever they go!

339
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,740
Get lost, Love Cook.

340
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,440
Say what, you--?!

341
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,330
A-Anyways! It looks like we can
travel together for a short while!

342
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,690
Yeah, yeah! His brother
is more than welcome here!

343
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,040
Let's have a fun time, Ace!

344
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,710
Yeah!

345
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:21,110
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

346
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,200
I continue on to the ends of emotion

347
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I scoop up my hands,

348
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,790
and the sand and time
that spills from them

349
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:45,800
show me that this is
what I was born to do

350
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:57,890
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

351
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:08,610
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

352
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,820
no one knows about

353
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,630
This is Erumalu?

354
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,190
Huh? There's nothing here.

355
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,650
Erumalu, the City of Green...

356
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,970
The City of Green?!
There's no green anywhere!

357
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,050
It was a thriving city
until just recently...

358
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,220
This was?

359
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,980
Karoo. I have an important
favor to ask of you.

360
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,380
I want you to go to Alubarna!

361
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

362
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,110
"Erumalu, the City of Green,
and the Kung Fu Dugongs!"

363
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
