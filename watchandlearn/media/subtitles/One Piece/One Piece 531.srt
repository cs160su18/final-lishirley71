Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

WE GO!

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,150
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,480
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,150
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

71
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,020
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he

72
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,670
ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,320
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,630
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,670
Luffy and his crew returned
to Sabaody Archipelago.

77
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,090
And on their way to the New World,

78
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,510
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

79
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,140
I'm going to invite you to
the Ryugu Palace-jamon!

80
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:42,200
"The Ryugu Palace! Taken by
the Shark that They Saved!"

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,050
A FEW HOURS AGO

82
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,040
A few hours before...

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,050
...Luffy and the others met King Neptune...

84
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,010
THE RYUGU KINGDOM MERMAID COVE

85
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,090
At the Mermaid Cove in the Ryugu Kingdom...

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,180
Somebody sealed this very tightly!

87
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,230
--I wonder what's inside.
--Let me guess...

88
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,320
If the barrel is so important to them,

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,490
like a treasure chest, it must be
high-quality liquor or something.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,700
It's really tight!

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,530
Wait! That's enough!

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,420
You loosened it up pretty
well and that's enough for me!

93
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,340
What? There's someone inside?

94
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,920
No way!

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,700
Thank you!

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,120
I appreciate your help, Mermaids!

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,790
Don't try to get away!

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,830
Get to the water now!

99
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,630
It's too late!

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,930
I'm sinking!

101
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,020
It's a swamp! On rocky ground?!

102
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,890
It's a muddy swamp that you can't escape!

103
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,900
It's a bottomless swamp!

104
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,590
I'm a Devil Fruit eater!

105
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,930
I ate the Swamp-Swamp Fruit
and became a swamp man!

106
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,570
The more you struggle...

107
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,240
No!

108
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,280
...The more you sink!

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,490
Help!

110
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,710
Stop calling for help!
I'm not gonna kill you!

111
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,250
Somebody...

112
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,670
I said "Stop," didn't I? You fool!

113
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,130
Ishilly!

114
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,510
I just want you to sleep for a while!

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,330
My body is bottomless!

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,620
Now how much were Mermaids going for?

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,580
If I remember right,
70 million each at auction.

118
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,880
I got 3 of them so that'll be...

119
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,050
I have to thank the Straw Hats!

120
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,710
Because of them, I made it
into the Fish-Man Island

121
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,000
without going through immigration!

122
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,810
I can hunt these valuable
Mermaids as much as I want!

123
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,800
This is a treasure island for me!

124
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,610
Ishilly!

125
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,860
Ishilly!

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm sure I heard them around here!

127
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,490
Ishilly...

128
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,330
AT THE PRESENT TIME

129
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,330
And now,

130
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,500
at Coral Hill, the port
town in the Ryugu Kingdom...

131
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,830
THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE PORT TOWN--CORAL HILL

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,460
The Straw Hat Pirates?!

133
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,920
They kidnapped girls from the Mermaid Cove?

134
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,630
No, that's not what I meant.
They were all pretty nice.

135
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,640
First of all, they're Camie's friends.

136
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,280
Maybe they made a threat against her.

137
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,540
No!

138
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,400
In fact, at the place at the moment,

139
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,570
there were only us guards, the Mermaid girls,

140
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,780
the guys from the Fish-Man
District who were beaten,

141
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,160
and the Straw Hats.

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,740
And now they're gone so who
knows what they're doing.

143
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,530
Humans have a good reason
to kidnap Mermaids.

144
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,910
Young Mermaid girls have been
traded at high prices in their world.

145
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,330
But you can't suspect them blindly...

146
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,810
Don't you know that there
were a lot of pirates

147
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,660
who got close to Mermaids...

148
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,340
...pretending they were
nice only to kidnap them?

149
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,930
Hmmm...

150
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,930
Prince Fukaboshi!

151
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,990
And Madam Sharley, did you really see the

152
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,190
future that you mentioned a while ago?

153
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,020
That the pirate - Straw Hat Luffy

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,860
will destroy the Fish-Man Island?!

155
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,510
Madam Sharley, drink some water.

156
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,760
Yes, I saw the future.

157
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,170
It's true that I saw it.

158
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,070
Even the people at the Ryugu Palace like us

159
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,170
know how accurate your previsions are.

160
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,220
It's no good.

161
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,180
I was going to treat them nicely
since they saved my sister's pet, but...

162
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,070
Although everything remains uncertain,

163
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,290
we can't let them be at large!

164
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,610
We have no choice but to
take them into custody!

165
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,940
AROUND THE SAME TIME

166
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,980
Around the same time,

167
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,400
THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE HIGH-CLASS DISTRICT--FISHVERLY HILLS

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,440
at the high-class district
of the Ryugu Kingdom -

169
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,700
Fishverly Hills...

170
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,160
They're gone.

171
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,990
So who were they after all?

172
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,540
King Neptune came to pick them up himself

173
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,620
and invited them to the Ryugu Palace.

174
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,590
Don't fall.

175
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,630
Neptune!

176
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,550
Whale!

177
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,390
Shark! Shark!

178
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,180
Jamon! Jamon!

179
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,930
Jamon! Jamon!

180
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,730
Jamon! Jamon!

181
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,690
Neptune!

182
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,360
What is that chant, old
man? It sounds so dumb!

183
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,090
No, that's rude! Straw, you bastard!
Terrifying! You're terrifying!

184
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,100
That shark--Megalo is a pet that
my daughter loves so much-jamon!

185
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,020
She kept crying hysterically
saying "Megalo is not coming back."

186
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,690
I wasn't aware he was attacked by the Kraken.

187
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,320
Thank you for saving him from danger-jamon!

188
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,330
We didn't mean to but I'm
glad that you're okay!

189
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,410
So he's the Mermaid Princess' pet?!

190
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,610
Oh, Pappagu-san? If I'm correct,

191
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,800
you said you're the best friend
of the Mermaid Princess.

192
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
Shh! Shh!

193
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,730
Oh, so that was a lie!

194
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,260
Anyway, I feel sorry for Sanji-san!

195
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,640
He wanted to see the Mermaid
Princess more than anybody!

196
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,880
I guess he was just born to be unlucky.

197
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,380
But a princess who has a
shark as a pet must be...

198
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,700
I-Is it okay...

199
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,060
...for us to go to the Ryugu Palace?

200
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,710
He said "Your friends can
come-jamon" so it should be okay.

201
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,650
Normally you're not allowed, right?

202
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,090
Then, why don't you just enjoy it?

203
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,640
I sent out my sons first but
they haven't come back.

204
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,510
That's why I came.

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,750
Because I can't wait to see the food at the

206
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,310
banquet so I want to start already-jamon!

207
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,520
I can't wait, either!

208
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,690
Hey, you two, quit drooling!

209
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,320
Oh, I almost forget. I already
invited one of your friends.

210
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,490
He is a swordsman.

211
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,150
He started drinking on his
own before the banquet.

212
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,120
It's more fun to have a banquet
with everybody - he is so selfish.

213
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,290
I think his name was...

214
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,670
Is it Zoro?

215
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,040
Must be Zoro...

216
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,550
Zori!

217
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,760
It's Zoro!

218
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,720
My soldiers will find the rest of your
friends and bring them to the palace

219
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
so don't worry-jamon.

220
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,600
Nami, don't you know where they went?

221
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,400
Looks like a good place to shop!

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,240
There are so many people here.

223
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,570
Maybe it won't take that much
to get some information.

224
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,870
About Luffy and the others?

225
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,260
That, too.

226
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,460
But what I wanna know
the most is the whereabouts of...

227
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,320
...my shipwright master -
Tom-san's relatives.

228
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,330
This is where he came from.

229
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,870
If his family is here, I have
to tell them the way he lived.

230
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,520
We just got back together
but let me do this on my own.

231
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,190
It doesn't seem like
there is any stopping you.

232
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,860
I wanna check on something too.

233
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,270
You too, Robin?

234
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,840
There are a lot of ancient
traditions on the Fish-Man Island.

235
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,470
So there must be some
important pieces of history

236
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,660
that haven't been revealed yet.

237
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,330
Important pieces of history...?

238
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,920
So we got separated again.

239
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
You didn't have any problem either, did you?

240
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,130
No... Well, there was a little one.

241
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,180
Hey, by the way, grandpa...

242
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,600
Call him "God of the Sea - Neptune-sama"!

243
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,310
This place is at 10,000
meters below sea level

244
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,320
so why is there light around this island?

245
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,410
The island itself doesn't
provide any light.

246
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,530
This is the only place in the deep sea

247
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,870
that has light so Fish-Men started
living here a long time ago.

248
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,790
And that was the beginning
of the Fish-Man Island.

249
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,840
There are the roots of a giant
tree called the Sun Tree Eve...

250
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,090
...that transfers sunlight from
the surface to the deep sea.

251
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,440
Transfers sunlight?

252
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,760
You mean there is a tree with

253
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,350
shining roots more than 10,000 meters long?

254
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,350
Yes, indeed.

255
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,400
Scientists try to make some senses out of it

256
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,950
but it's a mystical tree that transfers
sunlight to its roots-jamon.

257
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,650
And its respiration supplies
air to the sea floor as well.

258
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,740
It's like the boss of the Hustle
Muscle Mangrove at Sabaody?

259
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,250
Hairy old man, I'm hungry!

260
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,700
You!

261
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,370
We'll be there soon!

262
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,920
It's huge!

263
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,260
That's the entrance-jamon.

264
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,990
--Yes?
--It's me-jamon.

265
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,080
I-It must be K-King-sama!
I'll put down the gateway now!

266
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,620
Oh yeah, take this.

267
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,750
What's this?

268
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,460
It's a Bubbly Coral.
You can make a bubble easily with it.

269
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,470
Most of the palace is filled with sea water.

270
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,970
You need a good bubble-jamon.

271
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,900
This is handy!

272
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,820
Alright, let's go.

273
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,950
Neptune!

274
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,830
It's fast!

275
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,120
Oh, I can't wait to see the Ryugu Palace!

276
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,910
Wh-What should we do, Pappagu?

277
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,940
As a man who was invited to the Ryugu Palace,

278
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll become even more famous.

279
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,260
Your face is twitching.

280
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
Here we are.

281
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,020
THE ROYAL PALACE OF THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE RYUGU PALACE

282
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,620
Cool! Awesome!

283
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,790
Pappagu-san's house is
nothing compared to this.

284
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,620
Don't compare!

285
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,250
What a beautiful palace!

286
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,300
--King Neptune is back!
--We were wondering where you were!

287
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,760
Open the gate!

288
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,300
The gate will open!

289
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,850
Welcome home, King-sama!

290
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,980
This palace looks fun!

291
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,530
It's my palace-jamon!
Stay as long as you like!

292
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,490
Boy, you did it again?!

293
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,650
You must learn your place!

294
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,860
You went out of the palace on your own again!

295
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,420
It's inexcusable to go down to
the lower world without guards!

296
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,500
Can't take it.

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,210
It won't happen again-jamon...

298
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,730
He got yelled at...

299
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,720
It'll be too late once something happens!

300
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,010
Don't you know the situation
of this country right now?!

301
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,270
Let's have the banquet already!

302
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,400
By the way, I brought the people who
saved Megalo when he got attacked

303
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,860
by the Kraken-jamon.

304
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,490
Now welcome our guests!

305
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,620
Where is the Princess?
What is Princess Shirahoshi doing?

306
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,250
Well, King-sama,
it happened again a few minutes ago...

307
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,470
What?! You have to guard the
Princess to keep her calm!

308
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,970
Idiots!

309
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,930
If you go missing when something
like that is happening,

310
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,330
can't you see that it'd make everyone in
the palace worry, King?!

311
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,440
In the first place?!

312
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,900
It really won't happen again-jamon...

313
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,030
He got yelled at again...

314
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,200
And I'm very sorry that you just brought

315
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,790
THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE MINISTER OF THE RIGHT (SEAHORSE MERMAN)

316
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,450
the guests here personally
but there's a serious matter.

317
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,630
Yes, Prince Fukaboshi just called in and...

318
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,590
THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE MINISTER OF THE LEFT (CATFISH MERMAN)

319
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,290
I really can't take it!

320
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,590
Fukaboshi did? What was it about?

321
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,130
As a matter of fact...

322
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,550
Aren't they gonna entertain us yet?

323
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,430
Oh? Where did Luffy go?

324
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,790
He was here a couple minutes ago.

325
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,810
That fool can't stay still even for a minute!

326
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,650
He can't just wander around
the holy palace of the Sea God!

327
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,790
It's no mistake! I can smell
food in the sea water!

328
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,620
Smells really good!

329
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,750
Is it this way?

330
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,520
There's no water here?

331
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
The smell is gone!

332
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,040
It must be through those doors then!

333
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,510
Maybe this is a banquet room.

334
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,470
He said Zoro is here already.

335
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,430
What huge, thick, solid-looking doors!

336
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,670
These walls look very solid too.

337
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,900
They look like the ones in Impel down.

338
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,740
They must have really good food inside!

339
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,020
It's dark. This isn't a banquet room.

340
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,170
But there was delicious food!

341
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,970
Then, is this food storage?
Who cares! I'll have some!

342
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,130
I'm starving!

343
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,890
What is this? Such a funny feeling.

344
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,270
What is it?

345
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,020
Coral is everywhere on this island.

346
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,530
What's this? It's so soft!

347
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,330
Oh? Did I hear someone?

348
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,880
This coral is like pudding!

349
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,130
Is somebody here?

350
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,770
What's wrong with you?

351
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,690
What are you doing on my body?

352
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,740
Who are you, sir?!

353
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,960
What?! It was a big
person... I mean, Mermaid!

354
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,420
You came here to kill me
like the others, didn't you?

355
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,750
But I'm not scared!

356
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,550
Because I am Neptune's daughter!
So I'm not scared...

357
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,010
...Not scared...

358
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,070
Somebody! Father-sama! Brother-sama!

359
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,690
Whoa, whoa! I didn't do
anything to you, did I?!

360
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,200
Oh, damn! What's with you?!

361
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,170
Princess Shirahoshi is a gigantic mermaid.

362
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,140
Vander Decken has doggedly pursued her, so she has lived for years in the Hard Shell Tower.

363
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,890
Decken hurls an axe at the tower in an attempt to take Shirahoshi's life.

364
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,020
Meanwhile, Nami's group has been surrounded by soldiers from Neputune's army!

365
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

366
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,730
"A Coward and a Crybaby!
The Princess in the Hard Shell Tower!"

367
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
