2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,900
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,360
Countless pirates fight--
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,630
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,410
also takes to the sea to-- become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,580
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,110
After being separated from his friends,

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,250
Luffy comes to rescue his brother Ace--

51
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,280
who has been captured by the Navy

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,240
by sneaking into Impel Down - the
greatest prison in the world!

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,910
After running into Buggy on level 1,

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,700
Luffy went on to level 2 - The
Floor of Wild Beasts from Hell,

55
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,540
where he joined up with Mr. 3
- a former Baroque Works agent,

56
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,790
and together, they all
headed to the lower floors!

57
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,930
It looks like there's a lot of fun
going on in the outside world!

58
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,770
Jimbei, "Fire Fist," just so you know,

59
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,400
there are dozens and dozens of silver
medalists in the world who in the end didn't win...

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,480
...against Whitebeard and Roger
all holding back their tears.

61
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,670
"Chief Guard Saldeath's Trap!
Level 3 - Starvation Hell!"

62
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,760
Monitor room! We are at the scene on level 2.

63
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,010
Can you see the image?

64
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,180
Yeah! Keep us updated!

65
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,570
Roger that!

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:02,110
IMPEL DOWN LEVEL 2 FLOOR
OF WILD BEASTS FROM HELL

67
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,400
What happened here?!

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,190
This hole is big enough for even
the Sphinx to fall through!

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,490
What does Straw Hat Luffy want?

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,150
Look! This is bad!

71
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,230
The prisoners on level 2 are all
free! How did they get the keys?!

72
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,920
Are they responsible for this, too?!

73
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,110
Those guards are in trouble!

74
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,780
Let's hear it for Captain Buggy!

75
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,240
He's our savior!

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,370
L-Level 2 reporting! We need backup, pronto!

77
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,120
The prisoners are...

78
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,590
Send Blugoris to level 2!

79
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,130
We've just received word of
Straw Hat Luffy's intent!

80
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,200
You did?! From whom?!

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,310
Fleet Admiral Sengoku at
the Headquarters sent word!

82
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,440
The invader - Monkey D. Luffy and...

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,810
...the condemned prisoner - Portgaz D. Ace,

84
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,820
those two are brothers!

85
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,610
What?!

86
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,740
Then, he came here to rescue "Fire
Fist" Ace before the public execution?!

87
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,700
Yeah, that's exactly it!

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,450
That explains why he keeps going down!

89
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,250
We were focused on Whitebeard's attack!

90
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,120
If he pulls this off, the
tide will turn against us!

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,390
Inform Warden Magellan at once!

92
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,940
And get the riot on level 2 under control!

93
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,060
NAVY

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
What's so funny, Garp?!

95
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,570
We're standing at a crossroads that
could change the whole world of the sea,

96
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,830
but he keeps causing problems,
one after another!

97
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,950
At Enies Lobby...

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,080
That symbol represents...

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,340
...the unity of over 170 member nations
in the four seas and the Grand Line

100
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,300
which is to say - the whole world!

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,050
Now, do you realize how big the
organization that is after her is?!

102
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,680
Now I know the enemies Robin has.

103
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,720
Sogeking!

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,060
Shoot the flag.

105
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,640
Understood.

106
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,980
My new weapon - The giant
slingshot called "Kabuto"!

107
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Let me show its power!

108
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,400
Sure-Kill! Fire Bird Star!

109
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,750
Agh! No!

110
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,920
And the time with the Celestial Dragons...

111
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,350
You annoy me, too!

112
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,710
All of this has been unprecedented!

113
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,170
And this time,

114
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,220
he's meddling with a prison where
no-one's escaped for 20 years!

115
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,800
Ever since the abhorrent Golden Lion,

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,470
a prison which has never been breached,

117
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,570
known for so long as a robust  and
iron-tight great fortress - Impel Down!

118
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,640
He has disgraced its name by being
the first to penetrate its walls!

119
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,450
How could he be your grandson, Garp?!

120
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,700
He sure has accomplished a
lot! I'm proud of my grandson!

121
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,610
Damn Bartholomew Kuma!

122
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,820
He said that he took care of the
Straw Hats at Sabaody Archipelago!

123
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,170
I knew that he was lying!

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,470
You weren't going to trust the
word of a Warlord, were you?

125
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,140
Anyway, I wonder how he got through
the Navy's impregnable defenses...

126
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,390
Maybe he just flew in!

127
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,820
Cut the crap! If you weren't
known as the hero of the Navy,

128
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,400
I would have made you take full
responsibility for your family, Garp!

129
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,530
You can take this old man's life but the
situation is far more serious than that!

130
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,010
It's not funny!

131
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,380
This has all been
the Navy's blundering!

132
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,910
Do you realize how much Tsuru and I
worked to deal with the aftermath?!

133
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,630
Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

134
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,140
Shut up!

135
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,570
Ouch!

136
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,990
Ow, ow, ow...

137
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,540
Ow, ow, ow!  This floor is like a frying pan!

138
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,010
Are we in the desert?! It's so hot!

139
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,640
Why is it so quiet?

140
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,360
Level 3! Oh, I never wanted to come here!

141
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Straw Hat! I'm doomed along with you, again!

142
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh! Looks like the lion's taking a cat nap!

143
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
I was talking!

144
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,950
This is especially difficult
for me and my wax powers.

145
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,520
It's really big!

146
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,840
Where are the stairs?

147
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,770
I don't know.

148
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,680
He can't stand here for much longer.

149
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
Alright, let's just go.

150
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,670
How long do we have to walk
until we get somewhere?!

151
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,790
Chatting won't do anything but waste energy.

152
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,470
Wow! Grilled chicken is served!

153
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,920
Don't be ridiculous!

154
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,090
That's a hummingbird that fluttered down
from upstairs and got grilled in the air.

155
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,740
How hot is it in here?!

156
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,220
It's cooked perfectly! Yum-yum!

157
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,140
How can he...?!

158
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,820
I'd prefer the lion from
upstairs be barbecued.

159
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,530
Who wants to eat an animal
that speaks like a human?

160
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,530
How can you have an appetite
at a time like this?

161
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,750
Oh! There are some cells!

162
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,950
So what? It's a prison!

163
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,790
That's why you're an idiot!

164
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,040
We can hide from the sun in there

165
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,840
and it's definitely cooler than outside!

166
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,130
Oh yeah! You're so smart!

167
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,590
Of course I am!

168
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,340
Mr. 3, you better make some keys!

169
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,770
Yeah!

170
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,060
There's no place to hide...

171
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,070
Hey, can we just get in...

172
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Isn't it a miserable sight?

173
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,830
Prisoners on this floor

174
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,950
were once all tough
criminals with more than 50 million berry bounties.

175
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,130
The heat from the Burning
Heat Hell underneath...

176
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:45,350
...along with depriving them of food
and water has made them half dead.

177
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,350
This is level 3 - the Starvation Hell!

178
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,500
Now you know why this floor
is covered with sand.

179
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,440
Don't tell me it's...

180
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,800
Chances are the sand that
you're stepping on now

181
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,040
is the remains of a
prisoner who has dried up.

182
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
If we stay here too long,

183
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,590
we will become like them before we know it.

184
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,480
We have to get away from here while
we still have sweat to spare.

185
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,810
Let's go to level 4 in hurry!

186
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,990
Seriously?!

187
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,520
Hey, not that way! We gotta
take the stairs on the left.

188
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,350
Oh yeah?

189
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,530
--No, we should take the pass on the right.
--Stop confusing me!

190
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,650
The targets are proceeding to the back.

191
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,660
I see. Just keep watching.

192
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's do it as we planned.

193
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,360
Haven't you been able to
contact Warden Magellan yet?!

194
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,900
--Not yet!
--What about the Blugoris?!

195
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,150
They headed off to catch the
invaders with their commander!

196
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,370
Damn! The security of Impel Down
shouldn't fall to pieces this easily!

197
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Why...

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,300
...are we back where we started from?!

199
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,240
Looks like we went in a circle.

200
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,500
Quit being so relaxed!

201
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,170
I told you that we should go right.

202
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,260
I hope we make it to level 4 soon.

203
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,800
--I told you "I'm not going!"
--I told you "I'm not going!"

204
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,740
You have to guide me!

205
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,930
You said that we were
gonna save Ace together!

206
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,480
We never said that!

207
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,270
Stop imagining things as you want them to be!

208
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,890
Didn't you say you would?

209
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,320
They are in!

210
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,400
Alright, draw the net!

211
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,820
Yes, sir!

212
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm going on my own then!

213
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,790
Ah?

214
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
What's this?!

215
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,010
Oh no! It's a trap! They got us already!

216
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,760
It's made of iron!

217
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,450
I can't use my Chop-Chop Fruit power!

218
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,440
Of course, it contains Sea Prism Stone!

219
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,930
They're gonna torture us for
attempting to break out.

220
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,700
We're goners.

221
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,960
We got the invader - Straw
Hat Luffy and two others!

222
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,710
--What do you mean "two others?!"
--Don't antagonize them, Buggy-kun!

223
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,380
It's over.

224
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,590
Damnit! I gotta rip this net!

225
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,800
There are guards and Blugoris here!

226
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,680
--Put the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs on them!
--Roger!

227
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,890
Damn! Damn! Damn!

228
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,700
Who're you?

229
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm Saldeath.

230
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,500
Saru-desu!? But you don't
look like a saru (monkey).

231
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,330
No! You're not listening.

232
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,750
I'm Saldeath.

233
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,740
So, you're a monkey, right?

234
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,640
No! Get it right! It's my name!

235
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,620
Give up.

236
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,800
CHIEF GUARD - SALDEATH--
A COMMANDER OF BLUGORIS

237
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
It's no use holding out.

238
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,600
There's no place to get away...

239
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,150
...in this closed underwater prison!

240
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,470
It's lucky you were caught by me.

241
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,360
Because there are four demon guards
prowling around on the floors beyond this.

242
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,460
What?!

243
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,740
He's right! I don't wanna
face them and the warden!

244
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,120
If only we have gone the right way there...

245
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,250
Oh no. We were watching you

246
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,890
but no matter which way you choose,
you would have ended up here.

247
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,880
Oh, is that how it was?!

248
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,300
Vongole bianco!

249
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh, Chief!

250
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,270
Pasta?!

251
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,520
Soup spaghetti!

252
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,410
He's onto pasta now!

253
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,730
We're gonna get squashed!

254
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,060
--Spaghetti!
--The Sphinx is awake!

255
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,830
Oh no, he's gonna break the net!

256
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,480
Don't let those three,
especially Straw Hat get away!

257
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,620
Deep-fried noodle!

258
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,410
Noodles, again!

259
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,670
He must've been going through a phase!

260
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,370
Yeah!

261
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,080
This is great! Now, we can run!

262
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
Get them!

263
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,760
Gum-Gum...

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,720
...Gatling!

265
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,260
Oh? Where'd they go?

266
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,340
Hurry up, Mr. 3!

267
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,110
I can't move quickly due to this heat...

268
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,620
Ah! They climbed up the net!

269
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,090
Straw Hat!

270
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,520
If you see Ace, tell him
that I said "hello" and...

271
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,060
"let's have a drink if I
ever see you again alive!"

272
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,550
Be a good little live bait for us, stupid!

273
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,280
I was happy to see you were
alright but... Alright! See ya!

274
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,800
Thanks for helping me!

275
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,840
Ugh! How sweet!

276
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,650
Ouch! It's heartbreaking!

277
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,190
Stay sharp! He is a pirate with
a 300 million berry price!

278
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,000
Now is our chance to run!

279
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
Alright!

280
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,660
I don't have time to fight you all!

281
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,830
Buckwheat noodle!

282
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,180
Oh no! He's still around!

283
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,090
You bastard!

284
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,140
He's gonna run! Chase him!

285
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,670
Where are the stairs to go down?!

286
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,690
We'll soon arrive at "Fire Fist" Ace's floor.

287
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,650
Finally. It took a long time.

288
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,490
It couldn't be helped.

289
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,220
That floor is filled with notorious criminals from
all over,

290
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,560
not just "Fire Fist."

291
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,130
It is not the place one can enter casually.

292
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,090
We're doing this as a favor for a Warlord.

293
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,320
It's my request.

294
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,300
You have to grant it, right?

295
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,530
Yes, I have to!

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,190
By the way, there is a prisoner
who was once a Warlord like you.

297
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,170
You don't have to worry. I
just want to see "Fire Fist."

298
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,860
I won't do anything improper.

299
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,150
You better keep it that way.

300
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,580
It's hot...

301
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,520
We'll be safe here! They're
after Straw Hat as we wished.

302
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,480
They closed up the staircase going up.

303
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,220
It's already too much for me to stay here.

304
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,100
Un, deux, faint!

305
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,950
Un, deux, come on!

306
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,040
--Un, deux, faint!
--Who's singing?

307
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,440
Un, deux, come on!

308
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,780
Un, deux, faint!

309
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,910
Un, deux, come on!

310
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,620
You know, this world is
about a man and a woman!

311
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,210
But when you're queer,
you're a little of both!

312
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,560
That's why we're the greatest!

313
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,600
The greatest!

314
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,430
The queer way is the greatest!

315
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,310
The greatest!

316
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,810
The queer way!

317
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,270
The queer way!

318
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,950
The queer waaay!

319
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,260
Impel Down beefs up security
after its series of incidents,

320
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,290
sealing the only way in and out.

321
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,960
Luffy and the others are
completely trapped inside.

322
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,300
Unaware of the dilemma he's in,
Luffy continues toward Ace's floor,

323
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,180
and unexpectedly encounters
an old friend along the way...

324
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,680
On the next episode of One Piece!

325
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,070
"The Unleashed Swan!
A reunion with Bon Clay!"

326
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
