2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,980
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,270
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,440
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,400
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,130
Pirate guys!

35
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,470
Straw Hat!

36
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,770
What brought you guys here?

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,200
Big Bro Franky asked us to bring you guys!

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,380
The dream ship has been completed!

39
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,010
They built an incredible ship!

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,690
What?! It's already done?!
That was really quick!

41
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,170
Five top-notch shipwrights
worked on it day and night!

42
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,220
Yeah, they did!

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,980
All right! Let's head there right away!

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,750
Yeah!

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,050
Straw Hat...!

46
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,510
Straw Hat!

47
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,470
Franky Family...

48
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,260
What're you guys running that
frantically for? You're out of breath.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,980
To tell you the truth, we came
to ask you a huge favor.

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,650
Did you see the wanted posters?!

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,980
Wanted posters?

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,230
Straw Hat, the bounty on
your head has gotten crazy!

53
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,030
And all the others, too, are wanted in addition!

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,160
Me, too?! All right!

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,370
Me, too...?!

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,700
Me, too?!

57
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,160
Instead of having me explain,
just take a look at these.

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,990
All seven of you now have
bounties on your heads!

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,590
Straw Hat Luffy, 300-million-Berry bounty.

60
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,050
All right! It went up!

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,520
Pirate Hunter Zoro, 120-million-Berry bounty.

62
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,810
Cat Burglar Nami, 16-million-Berry bounty.

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,190
Oh, no...

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,610
Cotton Candy Lover Chopper,
the gang's pet, 50-Berry bounty.

65
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,030
Fifty...?

66
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,780
Devil's Child Nico Robin,
80-million-Berry bounty.

67
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,950
Who's this...?

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,420
Black Foot Sanji, failed to obtained
a picture, 77-million-Berry bounty.

69
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,550
Hey, Sogeking's got a bounty, too.

70
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,380
Fifty...?

71
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,220
W-Well, we sympathize with you, or, well...

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,730
I'm sure you wanna say all sorts
of things, but, well... please wait.

73
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,090
The favor we're talking about
has something to do with this!

74
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,020
Please take a look at this!

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,980
Franky!

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,940
Cyborg Franky, 44-million-Berry bounty.

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
Oh, no! Bro's got a bounty on his head!

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,650
Oh, no!

79
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,970
That's right. We somehow
were able to get off the hook,

80
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,700
but Bro had no such luck.

81
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,300
If he stays in Water Seven,
his life will be in danger.

82
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,170
If he gets caught again, we're not
strong enough to rescue him!

83
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,260
But he probably will try to stay on this
island because he's worried about us.

84
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,180
So we got together and discussed it.

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,090
Straw Hat, please! You can
do it by force if you have to.

86
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,270
Please take Bro out to sea.
He's a pirate's son to start with!

87
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,740
Straw Hat!

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,700
This is how we all feel!

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,660
Please consider it!

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,790
You guys didn't have to ask me that.

91
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,120
I decided a long time ago that he's the
only person I'd accept as our shipwright.

92
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,080
Seriously?!

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,340
A-Are you guys all okay with that?!

94
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,960
--Who's this...?
--I-I guess...

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,180
Of course.

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,550
Looks like you have your answer.

97
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,140
I... I'm relieved!

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,100
Now that we know how they feel,
we'd better get going.

99
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,680
Okay, let's go, guys!

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,700
Yeah!

101
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,190
Where're you guys going?

102
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,070
The scrap heap island is this way!

103
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,530
Sorry... but we're not going to see him off.

104
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,870
Seeing him would make it
hard for us to say goodbye.

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,700
Mozu! Kiwi!

106
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,520
Tell him that we wish him all the best!

107
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,610
"The King of Animals that Overlooks the Sea!
The Dream Ship Magnificently Completed!"

108
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,480
You guys are prepared for the
worst regarding Usopp, aren't you?

109
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,230
Zoro...

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,690
This is how it should be.

111
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,200
Right.

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,900
Now, hey, you guys! Just how
long do you have to feel down?

113
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,150
Shut up! Why does mine have to
be the only one that's a drawing?!

114
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,310
People don't usually start off
with a bounty that large.

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,710
Huh? Just how does this
picture look like me?! Well?!

116
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,400
--How could they think this is me?!
--You look like that, you know.

117
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,090
Use real words. I don't
understand what you're saying.

118
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,220
I'll be the laughing stock... of all
the ladies throughout the world.

119
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,160
I was tricked...

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,390
He said he was a reporter from
one of the local magazines.

121
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,220
At least he did manage to
get a cute pic of me, but...

122
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,850
I've finally gotten a bounty myself...

123
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,740
I'm a pirate, too! I fought hard like a man!

124
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,930
I wanna file a complaint
about my 50-Berry bounty!

125
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,170
Well, there's always next time.

126
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,700
Straw Hat! What're you doing?!

127
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,910
Let's hurry. Bro's waiting for you!

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,210
Sorry!

129
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,970
Don't forget anything.

130
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,380
We're gonna get the ship
and Franky and set sail!

131
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,630
Luffy, Sanji isn't moving.

132
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,590
Just leave Twirly-brows be.

133
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,780
Huh?! Hey, wait!

134
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,260
Are you pirate ladies and guys already leaving?

135
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,930
Chimney, Gonbe, thanks for everything.

136
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,360
"Navy"

137
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,360
This is indeed an incredibly rare case.

138
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,700
Few though they may be,
to think that they all have a bounty...

139
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,460
Furthermore, their bounties
total over 600 million Berries.

140
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,710
By the way, this "Black Foot" guy...
why isn't there any picture of him?

141
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,990
Yes, sir, well... I am certain
that I took his picture,

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,230
but I was shocked when I
saw the developed picture.

143
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,100
This is the picture.

144
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,640
This is indeed something
right out of a horror story!

145
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,310
Did you take off... the lens cover?

146
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,280
Eh?

147
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,450
Bro!

148
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,740
We brought them!

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,140
Bro! Where are you?!

150
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,830
They're here.

151
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,940
Whoa! There's something huge!

152
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,930
Is that it?!

153
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,130
Hey! We're here, Franky! Give us the ship!

154
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,720
Oh, Ice pops!

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,710
So you're here.

156
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,300
Where's Franky?

157
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,720
Unfortunately, he had to go somewhere.

158
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,660
But the ship is completed.
I'll show it to you in place of Franky.

159
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah.

160
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,310
This ship is incredible!

161
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,830
When I saw its blueprints,
my eyes opened wide in surprise.

162
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,530
It can sail any kind of sea!

163
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,000
With this ship, going to the end
of the world isn't a mere dream.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,770
Hurry up and show it to us!

165
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,780
Hurry up!

166
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,830
Here is Franky's message to you, Straw Hat.

167
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,660
If you're going to be
King of the Pirates someday...

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,090
...board this King of Animals ship!

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,170
Incredible!

170
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,450
This is...

171
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,760
--What a spectacle!
--Well, well...

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Whoa! It's huge! It's so cool!

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,690
It looks like it has all sorts of things flying out!

174
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,060
Whoa! He's gonna give this to us?

175
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,730
I see... This is at least twice as big as Merry.

176
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,360
What a big fore-and-aft sail! Is this a sloop?

177
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,610
Let me see the kitchen! The kitchen!

178
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,740
What a fine ship!

179
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,930
I wonder what kind of
flower the figurehead is...

180
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,040
--Well, I think it's, of course, the mane of a lion.
--Whoa! The interior is incredible, too!

181
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,910
It's a deck with a lawn! It feels good!

182
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,420
A slide! Whoa!

183
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,630
Looks like we can do gardening, too.

184
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,840
What a good view it has!

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,590
Hey, where's the kitchen?!

186
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,320
That big gaffsail seems
to have a lot of mobility!

187
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,470
It's called brigantine.

188
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,960
Sloop boats sail as people's
imagination dictates.

189
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,440
The navigator's skills
determine the sail's usefulness.

190
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,610
I can hardly wait! I'll do my best!

191
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,810
I'm gonna go check out the ship, too!

192
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,070
Whoa! My dream fridge! One with a
lock on it! There's a huge oven, too!

193
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,040
Thank you, Franky! This ship is awesome!

194
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,460
Hey, Ice pops. Where's Franky?
We'd like to say thanks.

195
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,630
It seems he has no intention
of seeing you guys again.

196
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,800
What?

197
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,420
Straw Hat...

198
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,640
Are you going to ask him to
join you guys as a shipwright?

199
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,650
Yeah. How'd you know?

200
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,600
I've decided that he's our shipwright.

201
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,060
He seems to have realized it.

202
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,990
Then he doesn't want to?

203
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,510
It's the opposite.

204
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,070
He's not sure if he can turn you
down if you ask him face to face.

205
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,980
That's why he went and hid.

206
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,070
But, well, his honest wish is...
He wants to set sail with you guys.

207
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,560
That he's entrusting this dream ship that
he's been planning all this time to you

208
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,970
is proof enough, isn't it?

209
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,090
Whoa! There's an aquarium here!

210
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,340
Hey, you're right! Amazing!

211
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,630
Franky has come to genuinely like you guys.

212
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,970
But he's imposing a duty upon himself
to stay on this island forever.

213
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,600
A duty?

214
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,990
It's a stupid persistence, if you ask me.

215
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,760
If you really intend to take him with you...

216
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,030
...do whatever it takes.

217
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,270
Take him by force!

218
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,200
That's the only way to free him!

219
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
By force?

220
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,830
Those guys said the same thing,
too, but is that really okay?

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,130
This is the start of Bro's new life.
We mustn't show tears. Smile!

222
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,600
But... they're coming down
on their own. What can I... Ah!

223
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,690
Bro! What are you doing back here?!

224
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,960
Huh? Why do I need a reason?!

225
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,320
This is Franky House! It's my house!

226
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,060
But...

227
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm gonna come right out and say it, Bro!

228
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,160
You want to go with the Straw Hats, right?!

229
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Huh? Don't be silly!

230
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,320
There's no way I would, is there...?!

231
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,760
Look at this! With your skills, you guys
can't even properly build a single house!

232
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,710
We just went to see them...

233
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,010
...to ask them to take you out to sea!

234
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,310
You fools! Mind your own business!

235
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,650
B-But he had already made up his mind
to ask you to be their shipwright!

236
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,320
Why do I have to become a pirate?

237
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,280
It doesn't take a genius to see it.

238
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,350
We had never seen you building a ship before.

239
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,660
But I thought, "Wow, I never
knew he could look this happy."

240
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,750
I've never seen you having
that much fun before.

241
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,210
Bro...

242
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,430
You know the Straw Hats are looking
for a shipwright, don't you...?

243
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,620
You ran away on purpose, didn't you...?!

244
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,390
Look at this, Bro!

245
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,270
My wanted poster!
So they put it out, as I thought.

246
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,940
You shouldn't stay with us any longer!

247
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,570
We don't wanna be a hindrance to you!

248
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,920
Look at this, Bro!

249
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,420
My wanted poster!
So they put it out, as I thought.

250
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,300
You shouldn't stay with us any longer!

251
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,340
We don't wanna be a hindrance to you!

252
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,660
Don't talk so cocky! The hell with the Navy!

253
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,110
I took you all in when you were about
to die like dogs on the backstreets!

254
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,860
That might be true...

255
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,110
...but...!

256
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,320
You guys can't even live
without me, and... Whoa!

257
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,830
I got his swimsuit off of him!

258
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,380
Swimsuit? Why'd you do that...

259
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,700
Ah, wait! I get it!

260
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,330
--Good job!
--Pass it around!

261
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,080
Don't give it back to him, no matter what!

262
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
Give me my swimsuit back! Hey!

263
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,020
That's my best swimsuit!

264
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,890
Scatter! Let's go!

265
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,140
Fine by me!

266
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,810
He's coming after us!

267
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,770
You'd better know that you can't defeat me,
even if you all gang up on me at once!

268
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,570
Just one survivor would do!
Deliver his swimsuit to Straw Hat!

269
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,030
Bring it to the scrap heap island!

270
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,700
Strong Right!

271
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,800
Give me my swimsuit back!

272
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,500
Sorry! I don't have it!

273
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,330
I'm sure I saw you had it! Enough of...

274
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,260
Hey, brother! Take this!

275
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,310
Dammit! A fake-out!

276
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,100
Run to the southeast!

277
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,610
Hm? What's this fuss about?

278
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,120
The perv is... Franky is going on a rampage!

279
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,410
Not again!

280
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,420
The town will be destroyed!

281
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,410
He's coming this way!

282
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,760
Hold it, you bastards!

283
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,700
Hey! He's not wearing anything down below!

284
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,630
Ah! Ding-don...

285
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,030
Take the children inside!

286
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,780
Don't let them see the perv!

287
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,620
Strong Right!

288
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,510
Dammit!

289
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,270
You're committing indecent exposure!
You're under arrest!

290
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,200
Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

291
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,580
D-Deliver... Deliver the swimsuit!

292
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,650
We'll go ahead of him by Yagara and wait!

293
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay! Go!

294
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,980
The backstreets... have become a battlefield!

295
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
Dammit! My legs...

296
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,390
Oh, no... Is this it?

297
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,860
Hey! Pass it to me! This way!

298
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,660
Throw it to me!

299
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,620
Straw Hat...!

300
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,500
Straw Hat!

301
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,260
Package receipt confirmed!

302
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,220
You bastard!

303
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,600
Straw Hat!

304
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,960
Did you like the ship?!

305
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,330
Yeah!

306
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,440
I've never seen such an incredible ship! Thanks!

307
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,500
You perv! Go away!

308
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,480
--Have some shame!
--You perverted bastard!

309
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,740
Of course it is! In addition to my super design,

310
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,180
everything you guys requested was added!

311
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,750
Did you see the soldier
dock system I invented yet?!

312
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,170
No, not yet!

313
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,150
It's the biggest showpiece! I bet you'll like it!

314
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,420
He's coming this way!

315
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,870
What about the fish tank?!

316
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,880
I saw it!

317
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,240
If you put the fish you catch in the fish tank,

318
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,880
you can view and enjoy them
through the big tank downstairs!

319
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,440
It's a room that's like an aquarium!

320
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,890
You can have meals there with the others!

321
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,410
You can always have fresh fish!

322
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,690
I'm looking forward to it!

323
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,980
That ship is the ultimate dream ship
to you guys as well as to me!

324
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,360
So why are you...?

325
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,950
Give me my swimsuit back!

326
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,950
Chopper!

327
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,450
Yep!

328
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,250
H-He's coming! Roronoa-san!
Sanji-san! We're counting on you!

329
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,340
Leave it to us!

330
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,730
Get in!

331
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,310
Aim at the scrap heap island!

332
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,210
What're you guys doing?!

333
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,010
Franky Family's specialty!

334
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,020
Anything Cannon! Fire!

335
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,190
H-Hey, you guys! Enough with your jokes!

336
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,040
What?! He's flying there before
his swimsuit even gets there!

337
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,440
Hang on to me, Chopper!

338
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,870
Huh?

339
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,380
Gum-Gum...

340
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,010
...Rocket!

341
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,690
Wh-What the heck is that?

342
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,130
Is that some sort of a curse?!

343
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,370
You dummy! It's just a perv!

344
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,640
--We can see everything!
We can see everything!
--B-Bro...

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,530
We can see everything!

346
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,650
Well...

347
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,500
What the hell is going on?

348
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,870
Franky!

349
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,410
Thanks for the ship!

350
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,230
It's the best ship ever!
We'll take good care of it!

351
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,190
Yeah! I wish you a safe journey!

352
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,860
If you want me to give
this swimsuit back to you,

353
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,820
then join us!

354
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,430
Those idiots... They know they
can't do anything without me.

355
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,990
How cocky of them to say that!

356
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,600
To me, this town is...

357
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,930
You guys all are...

358
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,270
"Goodbye My Dear Underlings!
Franky Departs!"

360
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
