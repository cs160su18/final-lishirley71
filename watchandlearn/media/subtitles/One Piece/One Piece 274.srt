2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,750
Every single thing those guys do is interesting.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,660
Those who have common sense
wouldn't meddle with this island.

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,870
Just wait and see, Chimney.

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,040
Whether they end up surviving this or dying,

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,210
the entire world will be shocked
to learn of this incident...

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,640
Something that no one has been able
to do in the past several hundred years.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,140
After this battle,

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,310
the name of that straw hat kid will
be known throughout the whole world!

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Robin!

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,620
He's here!

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,790
Luffy...

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,270
I've come to get you!

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,470
Chief! A guy in a straw hat is shouting
something on the courthouse rooftop!

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,590
I think it's Straw Hat Luffy,
the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates!

16
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,640
Don't be ridiculous! When I checked
earlier, Blueno was on the rooftop!

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,810
Wasn't he standing watch?! That idiot!

18
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,730
What's he doing at a critical time like this?!

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,140
I did quite a bit of fighting, so...

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm starving!

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,830
For a time like this, I packed...

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,140
...a meal!

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm so glad that I had these in my pockets!

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,490
This is yummy!

25
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,970
So he is the one? Straw Hat Luffy...

26
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,650
What the hell is going on?

27
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,750
What's Blueno do...

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,240
Don't tell me... He couldn't have...

29
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,400
He's a member of CP9.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,610
He's a Six Powers master
with Devil Fruit powers.

31
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,870
Blueno, a superhuman with
a Power Level of over 800...

32
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,790
Okay! My power's back!

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,550
...was taken out by a brat like that?!

34
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,010
Ch-Chief! What should we do?!

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,760
Lucci... Where's Lucci?

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,770
Call in Lucci and the others!
Gather everyone here!

37
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,850
I'll order CP9 to annihilate
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew members!

38
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,860
Y-Yes, sir! Right away!

39
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,820
Tell the Baskervilles, too!

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,860
Tell them that if the pirates bring
down the drawbridge by some chance,

41
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,360
I'll cut off all of their heads!

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,340
Yes, sir!

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,430
Raise your head, Nico Robin.

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,540
They finally made it this far.

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,140
Hey, this is really crazy.

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,130
I now know that you accepted
the Government's terms

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,890
to save your friends and got brought in here.

48
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,100
But that agreement was casually
broken by that moron chief earlier.

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,230
It's not like someone will be saved just
because you meekly stay captured here.

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,320
So the only thing you can do is
accept their help and escape from here.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,290
And yet, you're looking quite gloomy...

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,220
...as if you're still running
away from something.

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,360
Are you afraid of your friends
dying here or something?

54
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,970
If you turn your eyes away
from them, they can't rescue you.

55
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,980
Hey! Isn't anyone there?!

56
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,700
I'll have you meet Straw Hat.

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,990
What?!

58
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,410
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

59
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,790
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

60
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,800
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

62
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,560
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

63
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,360
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,610
we will be able to make it through

65
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,870
Always!

66
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,580
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,550
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

68
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,590
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

69
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,180
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

70
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,490
We can't stop here

71
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,510
Around the world

72
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,770
Start me up!

73
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,510
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,580
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

75
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,540
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

76
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,330
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

77
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,540
Brand New World

78
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,760
Start me up!

79
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,640
"Give Us Your Answer, Robin!
The Straw Hats' Outcry!!"

80
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,320
Listen good!

81
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,530
We'll shut Nico Robin away
from Straw Hat immediately!

82
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,820
We're gonna head to the
Gates of Justice right away!

83
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,420
Bring those two!

84
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,830
Ch-Chief!

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,790
Just do it! Now!

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
But...

87
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,380
Franky's butt is inflating!

88
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,300
Ahhh! What the hell is that?!

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,650
Oh, hey, Spanda!

90
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,200
I realized that this is it for me,
so I've chosen to explode myself.

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,140
What?!

92
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,930
At least I'll get to take some
detestable guys like you with me.

93
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,930
Idiot! Wait, you idiot!

94
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,940
I'll end my life with a big explosion
3 km in diameter. So don't stop me.

95
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,820
Don't do it! Help! Don't take me with you!

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,820
Three... Two...

97
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,950
Dammit! I can't die here!

98
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,000
One...

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
Stop it!

100
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,800
Let's go, Nico Robin!

101
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,340
Coup de Boo!

102
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,720
All right! It broke the chains, too.

103
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
Ahh! I'm falling!

104
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,810
Super!

105
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,950
That was close.

106
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,540
Good thing there was a fence.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Hey, you aren't hurt, are you?

108
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,380
If I had another bottle of cola,

109
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,760
I could've also taken us to the
other side using Coup de Vent...

110
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh, well. Hey, Straw Hat's there.

111
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,350
Now, respond to him.

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,180
Ahh! We were tricked!

113
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,110
Chief! Franky and Nico Robin broke
the chains and went out to the balcony!

114
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,070
You fools! What're you doing?!
Capture them already!

115
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,610
If you let them get away,
I'll have you all hanged!

116
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,490
What?!

117
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,920
Oh, hey, Robin! Good! You're still there!

118
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,090
Luffy...

119
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,540
Capture them again! Don't let
them get away, no matter what!

120
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,510
You small fries! Stay out of my way!

121
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,910
Weapons Left!

122
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,220
Looks like Franky's there, too.

123
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,430
All right! Just wait right there.

124
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,710
It's far, but I'll try shooting myself there.

125
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,200
Gum-Gum...

126
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,460
Wait!

127
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,840
I've told you so many times already!

128
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,630
I won't return to you guys!

129
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,810
Go back! I don't wanna see your faces again!

130
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,100
Why did you come to rescue me?

131
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,140
Why did you come to rescue me?!

132
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,910
This isn't what I want.

133
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,420
When did I ask you guys to rescue me?!

134
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,210
I just want to... die!

135
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,640
This is interesting!
What the heck are they doing?

136
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,390
What're you doing?!

137
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,850
They risked their lives to come
all the way here! And you...

138
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,310
They did it on their own.

139
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,230
What?! Don't be ridic--

140
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,860
You're in my way.

141
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,370
Kaku! Did you do that to vent your rage?!

142
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,660
To vent your rage over eating a weird fruit?

143
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,380
Shut up! I do like its powers!

144
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,270
Oh? Is it just Straw Hat that's our enemy?

145
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,470
Yoyoi! Even if he's alone,

146
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,980
it's admirable that he made it this far.

147
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh, yeah. Blueno is down.

148
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,860
What a fool!

149
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,900
I guess being a bar owner for five
years would make one weaker, huh?

150
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,780
Even if he became weaker,
could he be defeated, though?

151
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,950
He's been defeated. Chapapa.

152
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,500
All right! I'm glad that you're here, CP9!

153
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,670
But wait a little longer. The Straw Hats
have just started imploding!

154
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,370
Let's watch it.

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,090
This is really interesting!

156
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,620
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...!

157
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,470
Ribbit?!

158
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,570
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...

159
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,190
Good job, Yokozuna! Keep it up!

160
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,130
Ribbit.

161
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,340
Ribbit!

162
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,400
--Guilty!
--Guilty!

163
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,700
Whoa! "Guilty" juries!

164
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,800
Step aside. We'll pass down
the verdict for that frog's crime.

165
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,320
Ribbit!

166
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,960
Guilty.

167
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,830
Guilty!

168
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,790
Seriously! What the heck are these guys?!

169
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,220
Guilty! Guilty!

170
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,820
Let's go, Chopper!

171
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,990
No, I mean, go, Chopper!

172
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,930
What?! Just me?!

173
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,700
I never thought that someone
like the Chief Justice

174
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,400
would exist on this island in the first place,

175
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,630
since I heard that those taken to Enies
Lobby were already considered guilty,

176
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,860
so they'd just pass through an
empty court without stopping.

177
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,220
That's wrong, pirates.

178
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,430
This is the most authoritative,
fair court in the world.

179
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,870
One is judged fairly in trial.

180
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,380
However...!

181
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,650
That is, except for the fact that the juries
who judge guilty or innocent

182
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,800
are former pirates who're on death row,

183
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,760
and they wish to take you down with them.

184
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,420
Us, go down with death-row convicts?!

185
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,450
Hence, in this town, no one...

186
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,500
...in history...

187
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,680
...has been found not guilty!

188
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,020
Kiwi!

189
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,070
Guys!

190
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,990
--Guilty!
--Guilty!

191
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,510
Dammit! They're...

192
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't flinch!

193
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,740
If we don't get through here,
we can't bring down the drawbridge!

194
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,590
We left Bro's rescue to Straw Hat!

195
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,930
If we get stuck here,
the Straw Hats can't move forward!

196
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,340
Yokozuna!

197
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,190
To think that you got hit directly
several times with those big iron balls!

198
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,600
You bastards!

199
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,300
Don't bother! We've still got
more than 6,000 soldiers.

200
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,610
Now, surge into the courthouse!

201
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,250
Crush the pirates!

202
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,330
Ribbit...!

203
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,860
Wh-What's going on? Why are the giants...

204
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,050
Frog!

205
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,640
Hey! Tell me what's going on!

206
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,580
Ah... You're with the Straw Hats.

207
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,360
What the heck is going on?!

208
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,110
To think that he's been holding
back this many guards...

209
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,610
Yeah! That frog is something else!

210
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,050
Where the hell are they? They got
lost again. We don't have time for this.

211
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,570
Hm? Oh, yeah...

212
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,220
Basically, so long as I get to the upper floors,
it doesn't matter how, right?

213
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,840
Dragon Twister!

214
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,510
What?! What's going on?!

215
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,320
This area is dangerous, too!

216
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,320
As I thought, you guys are no ordinary people!

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,440
To think that you subdued the giants.
What a fearful man you are!

218
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,380
Hm? Er... Well...

219
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,740
Oh, yeah. All of your friends
headed to the rooftop.

220
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,420
--Rooftop?
--You should hurry there, too!

221
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,390
King of snipers. Leave it to me.

222
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,940
Huh?

223
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,690
You wanna die?!

224
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,810
That's right!

225
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,090
Hey, Chief. If we go over there
quickly and eliminate that guy,

226
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,740
wouldn't that end this whole thing?

227
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,770
Well, wait. A captain who came all
this way to rescue his crew member

228
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,330
and yet finds them turning down
his rescue at the very end...

229
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,140
Have you guys seen something
that interesting before?

230
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,400
Robin!

231
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,090
You wanna die?!

232
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,810
Listen to his pathetic shout!
I can only imagine the look on his...

233
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,100
What the heck are you talking about?

234
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,330
Wh-Wh-What?!

235
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,950
H-He's picking his nose!

236
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,130
Listen, Robin.

237
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,620
We've already come this far.

238
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
So, we're gonna rescue you anyway.

239
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,650
--Landed.
--Oof!

240
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,020
If you still wanna die after that,

241
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320
you can die then.

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,400
Ow, ow, ow...

243
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Are you okay, Chopper?

244
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,110
Yeah, I'm all right.

245
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,170
But what just happened?

246
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,790
Hmm, I have some idea.

247
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,180
I should've come up here
like this from the start.

248
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,770
Zoro! So it really was you!

249
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,560
We were okay because we
were on the outskirts of it,

250
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,940
but if we had been right in the middle
of your attack, we would've died!

251
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,720
Huh? What happened to you guys?

252
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,900
Hiyaa!

253
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,180
Dash! Boar Stew Shoot!

254
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,080
I'm the first to arrive, without a doubt.

255
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,850
Now, I've kept Robin-chan waiting.
I'm coming to rescue...

256
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,500
Moss!

257
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,040
Moss-head! How come
you got here before me?!

258
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,920
Oh? What took you so long? Did you get lost?

259
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,720
H-H-Hey, where'd you learn that phrase?

260
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,060
Ahh...! Sogeking!

261
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,360
What?! He's flying!

262
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,300
Amazing!

263
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,180
Where's he been all this time?

264
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,270
Is he... gonna land okay?

265
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,730
Whoa... They're gathering one after another.

266
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,330
Yoyoi! In any case...

267
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,760
Sogeking!

268
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,680
...to think that they've
marched into headquarters...

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,010
Although they're our enemy, that's admirable!

270
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,830
A-A-A bunch of pirates have made it this far!

271
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,810
I'm begging you, Robin!

272
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,050
You can go ahead and say
you wanna die or whatever,

273
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,860
but say those things... by our side!

274
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,140
He's right, Robin-chan!

275
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,290
Robin! Come back!

276
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,080
Hey, Sogeking. Can you stand up?

277
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Hm...?

278
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,500
Yeah, of course. This kind of wound is nothing.

279
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,700
Don't worry. I'm all right.

280
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,010
Just leave the rest to us!

281
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

282
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

283
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,190
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

284
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,190
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

285
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,450
We'll become No. 1

286
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,320
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

287
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,530
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

288
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,700
an era created by risking everything

289
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,830
We always try our best, let's go!

290
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,830
If we want to achieve glory,

291
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,210
now is the time--don't be afraid

292
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,130
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

293
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,090
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

294
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,090
We can take off with unknown powers

295
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,350
We don't fear, and we don't waver

296
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,060
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

297
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,100
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

298
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,070
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

299
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,320
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

300
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Charge ahead

301
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's start running towards tomorrow

302
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

303
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,070
You stupid pirates!

304
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,490
You won't be able to put on
a brave front for long!

305
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,030
I have power!

306
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,740
--Don't tell me...
--That's right!

307
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,040
The power that wiped out your hometown
Ohara exactly twenty years ago...

308
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,790
Buster Call!

309
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,670
Don't! Not that!

310
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,170
On the next episode of One Piece!

311
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,050
"Robin's Past! The Girl
Who Was Called a Devil!"

312
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
