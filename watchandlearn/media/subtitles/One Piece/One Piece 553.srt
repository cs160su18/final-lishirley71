00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

It’s important not to wake up

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,850
We won’t left anyone behind

57
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

The sun of my heart will never set

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,650
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,940
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,660
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,700
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,870
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:03,470
There are 30,000 human slaves we've
caught in the sea over the past month.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,220
And 70,000 Fish-Men who know how to use arms.

82
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,150
They moved here from the
closed Fish-Man District.

83
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,610
Behold...

84
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,820
...100,000 outlaws altogether!

85
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,530
Look how powerful I am!

86
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,660
This is the power that I'm talking about!

87
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,340
I started this whole thing 10 years ago.

88
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,590
Let me tell you something.

89
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,050
Concerning the late Queen of the Ryugu
Kingdom, who you fools still love!

90
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,850
Otohime was killed by...

91
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,480
...me!

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,320
What?!

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Your mother was not murdered by a human!

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,660
I, her kinsman, did it!

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,670
I, standing in front of you now, killed her!

96
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,970
I already knew it.

97
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,260
Shirahoshi!

98
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,900
What?

99
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:47,070
"Shirahoshi's Tears!
Luffy Finally Shows Up!"

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,670
What do you mean you already knew that...

101
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,380
...I killed your mother, Shirahoshi?!

102
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,430
Father! Are you all right?!

103
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,350
Stay with us!

104
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,610
Shirahoshi!

105
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,110
A few years after it happened,

106
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,990
Megalo told me secretly.

107
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,830
Megalo?!

108
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,370
He did?!

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,800
Is that true, Megalo?!

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,470
No...

111
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,610
Megalo was owned by
Neptune's army back then.

112
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,360
And he witnessed everything that day!

113
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,460
Mother! Mother!

114
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,270
I can't believe it.

115
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,980
Princess Shirahoshi, why didn't you...

116
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,810
If I told anyone...!

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,450
Someone would hold a grudge
against Hordy-sama, I thought.

118
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,120
And that is not what Mother-sama wanted!

119
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,390
That was the last promise we made with her.

120
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,810
She told us that no matter who did it to her,

121
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,310
we should not get angry or hate anybody!

122
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,320
So it doesn't matter who did this...

123
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't get angry on my behalf.

124
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,750
Don't let resentment or hatred
get the better of you for my sake.

125
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,000
Shirahoshi, you...

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,050
Don't tell me that you...

127
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,340
You did as Mother said
to do 10 years ago and...

128
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:06,100
...you have been keeping this to yourself all
this time, alone in the Hard Shell Tower?!

129
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,610
She tried not to harbor hate for
the one who killed her mother?

130
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,870
Even though it was her dying mother's wish,

131
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,830
it's almost unthinkable someone
would be able to keep such a promise!

132
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,750
She is such an obedient, admirable girl!

133
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,960
Who else could have done such a thing?!

134
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,890
Stop laughing, you fool!

135
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,810
I can't help it! Hey, Megalo?

136
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,860
If you had cried out right there,
you could've drawn everybody's attention

137
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,190
and let them know that I
was the one who did it.

138
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,280
So thank you for shutting your mouth!

139
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,540
And thank you for confiding
only in this dumb girl!

140
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,330
If it were anybody else,
we couldn't have come this far!

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,840
You know, Shirahoshi,
what you did was pretty stupid!

142
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,800
That's what we call those
actions in this world!

143
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,680
Because you tried to stymie your
hate for me, this kingdom will fall.

144
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,520
Because of you,

145
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,400
your father, your brothers, the citizens,
and you yourself are all going to die!

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,190
Shirahoshi!

147
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,570
No, don't listen to him, Princess-sama!
You did nothing wrong!

148
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,750
No, it was definitely foolish!

149
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,380
Shark Arrows!

150
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,090
King! Princes!

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,220
Stop! Please stop!

152
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,090
Father-sama! Brothers-sama!

153
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,390
Look how miserable they are!

154
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,970
No...

155
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,180
We are doomed!

156
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,560
Great warriors?! Pathetic!
They're barely alive now!

157
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,240
It's because Captain Hordy is so strong-ch!

158
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,700
They can't make it until
the time of execution-ch!

159
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,700
That's not good. They must
be executed by beheading.

160
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,370
Hey, I need a sword.

161
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,000
Our only concern was Jimbei and
Shirahoshi, and we got them now.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,130
There is no reason for us to wait
until the appointed time now.

163
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,140
I'm going to execute these
worthless creatures...

164
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,140
...of the royal family!

165
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,230
Yeah! Kill them!

166
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,230
They deserve death!

167
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,070
Kill them! Kill them!

168
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,990
Kill them! Kill them!

169
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,710
No! They're really gonna kill
Neptune the Great Knight!

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,870
It's hell on earth!

171
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,380
They have 100,000 outlaws on their side.

172
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,130
This is it for our country!

173
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,970
Madam Sharley!

174
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,930
Children...

175
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,730
Tell me! When will the pirate with
a hat come to destroy the island?!

176
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,610
Tell me! When will it be?!

177
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,910
I don't know. All I know is what
will happen in the future.

178
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,450
It could be tomorrow or a year from now.

179
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,080
I want them to come now...

180
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,960
If they create havoc here now,

181
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,050
we might be in trouble but those
villains would be too, right?

182
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,840
I want them to come now, too!
I don't want them to kill the King!

183
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,180
Me neither!

184
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,810
You're right, children.

185
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,610
It's better if they came now.

186
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,360
Yes, yes...

187
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey! Straw Hat Luffy!

188
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,010
If you want to destroy the island,
why don't you do it now?!

189
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,050
Do your worst - right here, right now!

190
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,470
Yeah! Can you hear us, Straw Hat?!

191
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,350
If you're hiding somewhere
on the island, come here now!

192
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,100
Straw Hat!

193
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,150
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

194
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,570
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

195
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,110
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

196
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,570
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

197
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,990
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

198
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,460
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

199
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,000
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

200
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,190
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

201
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,940
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

202
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,320
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

203
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,870
How pathetic!
They're literally clutching at straws!

204
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,920
Sharley's previsions were always
accurate but this time, it's bullshit!

205
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,000
How meaningless...

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,470
Those fools must be out of their minds.
Let's bring them to their senses.

207
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,100
Listen, you stupid citizens!

208
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm going to proceed with the execution
of the former king, Neptune - now!

209
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,440
Father...

210
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,360
Watch very closely!

211
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,490
As I cut former king Neptune's head off!

212
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,420
Then, this half-assed king without a
drop of racial pride will be gone forever

213
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,130
and the new kingdom of Fish-Men will rise,
which will dominate the pathetic humans!

214
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,430
I'll put an end to the
shameless Ryugu Kingdom!

215
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,160
How regrettable!

216
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,620
Farewell!

217
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,040
Luffy-sama...

218
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,170
Luffy-sama!

219
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,890
Please save Father-sama!

220
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,480
Luffy-sama!

221
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,910
Megalo?

222
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,990
What?!

223
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,160
Th-That's...

224
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,670
...Straw Hat Luffy!

225
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,630
He really showed up!

226
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,800
Hey, did you see that? He saved King Neptune.

227
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,350
Yeah! And right before that,
Princess Shirahoshi cried for his help!

228
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,560
Luffy-sama!

229
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,310
Did he come out of the shark?

230
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,110
Was he hiding in its stomach?! But why?!

231
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,200
You're out already... But I
guess you had no choice!

232
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,620
Hurry up, you all!

233
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,750
Much! What the... Who is he talking to-ch?!

234
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,670
Don't worry! We were ready
from the beginning!

235
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,050
Because we knew that Luffy would never...

236
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,430
...sit tight as we had planned!

237
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,050
Mirage, release!

238
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,140
A woman appeared all of a sudden-ch!

239
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,400
Is this it, Jimbei-chan?
The letter from the Celestial Dragons?

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,110
That's it! Good job!

241
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,990
No way! Whoa! The letter is gone!
When did she take it?!

242
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,950
What were you doing, idiot?!

243
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,120
And I handed the key over to Robin!

244
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,370
No, don't tell me...

245
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,740
The key's gone!

246
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,580
What were you doing?!

247
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,080
It's unlocked!

248
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,040
Who did this?

249
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,170
Robin-sama?

250
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,260
Is this...

251
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,350
Father! Are you all right?!

252
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,930
Hey, look up! What's that?

253
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,270
That's...

254
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,100
A whale and a lion?

255
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,520
No, wait! That's...

256
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,530
Gaon Cannon!

257
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,160
It's a pirate ship!

258
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,450
Fire!

259
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,300
Now is your chance! Go, Whale!

260
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
Hoe?

261
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,730
Princes! Take the King and go!

262
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,520
Okay!

263
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,270
I won't let you do that! Wait-zugan!

264
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,820
Oh no, it took the King and the Princes!

265
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,620
Damn! Give us back the royal family-gaban!

266
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,240
What happened?

267
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,750
I think Jimbei hatched a
plan with the Straw Hats.

268
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,770
I can't believe that he really came.

269
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,020
Hey, look! That's...

270
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,030
Wow! Look how many people there are!

271
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,450
Oh no, are they all our enemies?!

272
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,450
I think so. It looks like
there are 70,000 or 80,000...

273
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,950
No, 100,000 of them, maybe.

274
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
That's a little tough!

275
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,670
You can go take a nap or something
if you want. I'll take care of them.

276
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,960
What do you mean, you fool?!

277
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,840
I can't wait!

278
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,300
Let's go wild, guys!

279
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,310
Look, the members of the Straw
Hats are coming out of the ship!

280
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,900
Hey! Straw Hat Luffy!

281
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,410
Are you really going to destroy the island?!

282
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,660
Why did you occupy the Ryugu Palace?!
Do you want to kill the royal family too?!

283
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,090
Was it you guys who kidnapped the Mermaids?!

284
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,130
Hey! Answer us!

285
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,670
Are you people friends or
foes to the Fish-Man Island?!

286
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,680
Answer, Straw Hat!

287
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,560
Friends or foes? That's something...

288
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,950
...you'll have to decide on your own!

289
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,300
The Straw Hats have gathered
in the Conchcorde Plaza.

290
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,010
But Hordy proclaims that he will
become King of the Pirates,

291
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,850
and sends the vast force of the New
Fish-Man Pirates to attack Luffy's crew.

292
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,020
Ten pirates will battle to decide
the fate of Fish-Man Island!

293
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

294
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,070
"A Big Clash! The Straw Hats vs.
A Hundred Thousand Enemies!"

295
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
