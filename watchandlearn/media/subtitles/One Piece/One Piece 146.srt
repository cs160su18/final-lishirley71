00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,290
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,510
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,390
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,400
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,470
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,980
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,320
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,660
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,960
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,340
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,740
Now you're all out of money.

20
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,530
So then... wanna bet your pants
or something, brother?

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,620
You're lucky, in a sense.

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,790
Playing with Roshio, if you had won,
he would have made you pay for it.

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,210
Sorry, but I'll be taking all your money.

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,010
Let it go. I won this money fair and square.

25
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,850
You cheated just now, didn't you?

26
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,140
Ain't that right?

27
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,100
What'd you say? When did I do that?

28
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,980
You did! You cheated!

29
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,730
Don't make ridiculous accusations, you punk!

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,570
Sarquiss! Sarquiss!

31
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,740
Hm? What?

32
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,700
You saw it, too, didn't you?
This guy just cheated.

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,290
Cheated?

34
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,080
Yeah... That's right. He cheated.

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,960
I saw it, too. What a dirty cheat!

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,470
Don't screw with me! You don't
know who you're dealing with!

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,910
"Quit Dreaming!
Mock Town, the Town of Ridicule!"

38
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,250
Still don't see it, Usopp?

39
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,710
No, I don't see it yet.

40
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,590
This Jaya island isn't that far, right?

41
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,430
Yeah, since the weather has
been stable for a while now,

42
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,800
we should already be
in the island's climate.

43
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,720
Then, Jaya must be a spring island.

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,270
It feels nice and warm.

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,810
Spring weather's nice.

46
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,320
It looks like the seagulls are enjoying it, too.

47
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,500
Ahhhh! They were shot!!

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,540
Oh, let's make yakitori!

49
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,040
Shot? I didn't hear any gunfire.

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,590
Look, I found a bullet! Considering
the direction that they were flying,

51
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,260
the bullets came from the
direction the ship's facing!

52
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,300
Are you saying that shots came from
an island that we can't even see yet?

53
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,390
That's impossible, Chopper.

54
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,300
But I was watching them the whole time.

55
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,060
Then what kind of eyesight, sniping skills
and rifle do you think this sniper has?

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,270
They were shot somewhere else
and just happened to fall now.

57
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,190
Sanji, we got seagulls!

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,660
Poor thing... He must've suffered.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,450
I wasn't able to kill one of them instantly.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,830
But that's also fate.

61
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,170
That's the result of how you lived.

62
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,390
Hey, you! Do you know who I am?!

63
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,760
Huh? I don't know, you fool!

64
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,190
How about I tell you, then?
I'm the Fighting Champion.

65
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,320
Wow! Cool!

66
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,110
I see a neat-looking town!

67
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,150
Hey, hey, doesn't it look kinda like a resort?

68
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,360
Resort?!

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,570
Hurry up, Merry!

70
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,410
Yeah, it makes me feel like
I want to stick around a bit.

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,340
But is it my imagination, or do the ships
lined up in the harbor look like pirate ships?

72
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,720
Silly Usopp, since when can pirate ships
just openly line up in a harbor?!

73
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,180
Y-You're right!

74
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,390
Help me! He's gonna kill me!

75
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,470
What's with this town?

76
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,190
What a weakling!

77
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,480
Hey, mister. You chose
the wrong guy to beat up.

78
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,070
Look at that symbol. He's one of Roshio's gang.

79
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,610
You've heard of him, right?
Roshio the Executioner,

80
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,990
whose bounty is 42 million Berries.

81
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,910
He's crazy, so you'd better be careful.

82
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,250
What a reckless guy!
That wasn't a bogus game.

83
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,630
But it's amazing that he beat up
Roshio the Executioner so easily.

84
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,920
Don't you know? That's Bellamy.

85
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,340
That guy?! Bellamy the Hyena,
the one with a 55 million-Berry

86
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,890
bounty on his head?!

87
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,720
Captain!

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,390
Who did this?!

89
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,730
In any case, he needs a doctor! Hurry up!

90
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,810
Captain, please hang on a little longer.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,670
There're all kinds of people here.

92
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,250
It looks like a fun town.

93
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,710
There's no way...

94
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,670
You think those two can come
back without getting into trouble?

95
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,510
Well, the town looks dangerous as it is.

96
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,390
It's next to impossible.

97
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,100
That's right. They can't do that!

98
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,100
H-Hey, Nami!

99
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,100
Wait for me, Luffy! Zoro!

100
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,230
She went...

101
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,110
Well, she'll probably be okay,
since those two are with her.

102
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,770
What? If Nami-san's going, then I'm...

103
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,440
Don't you go!!

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,780
If you go, wh-what'll happen
i-i-if this ship is attacked...?!

105
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,660
Please don't go!!

106
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,290
Fine! Let go of me!

107
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,210
Then, guess I'll prepare
some tea and hold the fort.

108
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,460
Hm? Where's Robin-chan?

109
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,210
Oh...? She's not here.

110
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,340
Sanji-kun, about that tea...

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,130
Make it yourself.

112
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,130
In this town, I will...

113
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,930
...not fight. I give my word!

114
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,140
...not fight. I give my word.

115
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,560
Good. This is serious, you two.

116
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah...

117
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,680
Yeah...

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,810
What's with the weak reply?!

119
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,520
If you cause trouble,
we'll have to leave this town!

120
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,690
If that happens, we won't be
able to go to the sky, got that?!

121
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:31,990
Yeah.

122
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,030
Who's he?

123
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,780
Look, he fell from a horse.

124
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,450
Yeah, he did.

125
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,790
Looks like he's in pain.

126
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,750
Yeah, it does.

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,340
Hey you guys, sorry to bother you,
but please help me get up.

128
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,090
You're not going to get up
by yourself, are you?

129
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,920
Luffy, get that side.

130
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,720
Okay.

131
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,470
Well, thanks... I'm on the horse now.

132
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,520
I was born frail.

133
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,890
Now, let's go, Stronger.

134
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,770
The horse, too?!

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Geez, what a pain.

136
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,570
Thanks again.

137
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,110
This isn't much of a reward,
but would you like some?

138
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,700
You're too suspicious! We don't
want any, so beat it already.

139
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,580
Hey, apples! Thanks!

140
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,580
Hey, hey!

141
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,000
What?! What happened?!

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Well, some guys were eating apples
that they got from a strange man,

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,210
and then they exploded. Five of them!

144
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,300
Oh, no...

145
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,180
Luffy! Spit it out! Spit out
the apple you just ate! Now!

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,260
I've already swallowed it.

147
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,390
You bastard! What's the meaning of this?!

148
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,230
Well, he's all right.

149
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,320
That's going too far!

150
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
It's a disaster inside.

151
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,820
If you ate a bad one,
you would've died on the first bite.

152
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,950
You're...

153
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,700
...lucky.

154
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,120
This is awful...

155
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,460
Hey, what the hell is this?

156
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,920
Roshio the Executioner's grave.

157
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,210
It looks as if a war happened here.

158
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,590
Did they fire a cannon or something
in the middle of the town?

159
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,380
Who knows? Even people who
were actually watching it said

160
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,090
that they couldn't tell what was happening.

161
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,810
All we know is that Roshio's
opponent was Bellamy.

162
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,270
Oh, Bellamy the Hyena?

163
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,020
There's no doubt that he's got
the power of one of the devil fruits.

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,420
Just what is up with this town?!

165
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, don't be so touchy, Nami.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,710
You almost got killed for no reason, you know!

167
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,720
I guess it happens sometimes.

168
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll be damned if it does!

169
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
That guy again...

170
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,520
How many victims have there been now?

171
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,190
It's not like he's a famous
wanted man. Who the heck is he?

172
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,900
Well, I don't even wanna know.

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,950
In any case, we should stay away
from that Fighting Champion.

174
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,160
Champion?

175
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,450
Why are you trying to compete?!

176
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,250
Ugh... I wonder if we can really
get information in a town like this.

177
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,590
How about this place?

178
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,210
Hmm... This place seems quiet.

179
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,010
Or rather, this place is lovely!

180
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,390
So although this is a rough town,
it has a place like this.

181
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,470
They have a vacation house on the sea, huh?

182
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,730
In any case, there's no one here...
although I can smell tasty food.

183
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,070
E-Excuse me! Please don't
come in without permission!

184
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,410
Th-This Tropical Hotel is currently
chartered by Bellamy-sama and his party.

185
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,200
So we're asking other guests to, er... leave.

186
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,290
Oh, this place was a hotel?

187
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,670
I-If Bellamy-sama sees you, it'll be a problem,
so please kindly leave immediately.

188
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,710
C'mon, what's wrong with just coming in here?

189
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,420
Who's Bellamy?

190
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,630
Hey, what's going on?

191
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,550
Who the hell are those shabby guys?

192
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,310
Sarquiss-sama! Welcome back!
Well, this is just...

193
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,180
Never mind your excuses!
Just get rid of them already!

194
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,690
How much do you think we're
paying to charter this place?!

195
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,810
She's right. Now, go home, you dumb brat!

196
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,360
Hey, can I beat him up?

197
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,020
No!

198
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,030
Ha! You're going to beat me up?

199
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,200
What funny guys! At any rate,
those are rags you're wearing.

200
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,870
Here! Take this money and buy
yourselves something you like.

201
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,420
Sarquiss, you're wasting money
by giving it to guys like them.

202
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,130
Maybe I should have thrown
it down the drain instead.

203
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,550
Oh? Are you sure?

204
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Let's go! This is unpleasant!

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Hey, hey, I can walk on my own.

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh? You don't want it?

207
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,060
Sarquiss! Lily! Don't tease them so much.

208
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,850
Oh, that's where you were.

209
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,440
They, too, worked hard in their
own way to travel here. Here.

210
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,570
Of course, compared to you
and Bellamy, they're trash, but...

211
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,740
For average guys, they're
doing better than others.

212
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,780
Well, they probably won't be able to survive
in the new era that is about to start, after all.

213
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Still... I see, 30 million... for that greenhorn?

214
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,790
I'll show this to Bellamy.

215
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,380
Dammit! I'm really pissed!!

216
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,050
That's a shame.

217
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,590
Mock Town depends on pirates
who spend lots of money, after all.

218
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,390
So poor pirates aren't invited, huh?

219
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,350
Looks like there's no way
of calming you down.

220
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,890
Here, this is on the house.

221
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,690
Since tough guys gather here,
there's lots of trouble.

222
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,400
But if you get bothered by it each time,
you can't get by in this town.

223
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,650
All you can do is play it safe
when dealing with people.

224
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,400
Here you go.

225
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,780
But this town is really unpleasant, you know!

226
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,490
That's probably how a
right-minded person would think.

227
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,370
But unfortunately, right-minded
people are rare in this town.

228
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,790
Well, the log will be stored
within four days or so.

229
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,210
So you should leave before you get into trouble.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,090
Four days... Then we can't stay even two days.

231
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,220
Hey, mister!

232
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, old guy!

233
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, buddy!

234
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,140
Hm? What's wrong?

235
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,970
This cherry pie tastes extremely bad! Hm?

236
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,970
This cherry pie tastes extremely good! Hm?

237
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,190
This drink tastes exceptionally bad! Hm?

238
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,190
This drink tastes exceptionally good! Hm?

239
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,820
Is there something wrong with your tastebuds?

240
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,740
Is there something wrong with your head?

241
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,620
Well, since I'm not the cook,
I don't care what you say.

242
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,960
Hey, old guy! Give me 50 steaks to go!

243
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,050
Buddy, give me 51 cherry pies to go!

244
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,880
Wait, make that 52 steaks!

245
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,840
Sorry, I want 53 pies!

246
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,430
No, 54 steaks!

247
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,720
55 pies!

248
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
60 steaks!

249
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
70 pies!

250
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,390
80!

251
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,100
100!

252
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,180
You bastard! Wanna fight?!

253
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,350
What the hell are you fighting about?!

254
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,270
Luffy, you promised, remember?!

255
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,980
Besides, we don't have enough
money to buy dozens of steaks!

256
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,320
We didn't come for shopping!

257
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,780
Are you a pirate?

258
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah, that's right.

259
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,910
What's the bounty for you?

260
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,030
30 million!

261
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,500
30 million? For you?

262
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,170
Can't be true! It's gotta be a lie!

263
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,330
I'm not lying! That's the truth!

264
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,170
Stop it!

265
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,170
Hey, no fighting in the bar!

266
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Take this and leave now! 50 cherry pies!

267
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,110
Is there a pirate with a straw hat here?

268
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,530
Hm?

269
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,820
I-It's Bellamy!

270
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,880
So, you're the 30 million bounty,
Straw Hat Luffy!

271
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,670
What's this about?

272
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,920
Looks like he's got business with you, Luffy.

273
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,840
Isn't Bellamy the guy chartering that hotel?

274
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,890
Did you hear that?
That shorty's worth 30 million.

275
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,050
He is?

276
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,430
Is that true?

277
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,310
Boy, I keep running into tall guys today.

278
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,190
Give me your most expensive alcohol.

279
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,900
And give this shorty what he wants as well.

280
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,810
Okay.

281
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,400
Huh? This place is full!

282
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,530
What is this place? It's stinky and dirty!

283
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,240
And cheap-looking rum
is about all they've got.

284
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,080
Look. They're from earlier.

285
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,290
You should offer us your seats, geez...

286
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,630
What hopeless dumbasses!

287
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,550
That's him, Big Knife Sarquiss, right?

288
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,880
Is he going to start a fight here or something?

289
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,970
No way...

290
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:24,890
"Deer"

291
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,770
The whole gang is here. There's
no way they just came for a drink.

292
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,870
Leave them be! It has nothing to do with us!

293
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,100
Bellamy sure is a curious one.

294
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,420
He sure is.

295
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,860
Well, have a drink.

296
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,540
Oh, thanks! You're actually a nice guy!

297
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,770
Darn! He did it!

298
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,190
Bellamy's nuts!

299
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,210
What's the meaning of this, small fry?

300
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,790
Why don't you tell me?

301
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,850
Zoro! Hold on a minute!

302
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,590
We haven't gotten any
information in this town yet!

303
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,410
Shut up! I'm just taking him up on his offer!

304
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
Hm? So you got back up!

305
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,480
So you're ready to take me on, huh?

306
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,970
Whoa! They're gonna take Bellamy on!

307
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,730
Go for it!

308
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,500
Don't get beaten!

309
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,500
This isn't a fight, it's a test!

310
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,460
C'mon! Let's see how strong you are!

311
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,990
Luffy, wait!

312
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,050
Hey, Mister! We want to go to the sky island!

313
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,760
Do you know anything about it?

314
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,460
What did that chick... just say?

315
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,210
She can't be serious.

316
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,300
Like I said, if you know how
to get to the sky island...

317
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,730
She said "sky island"!

318
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,250
Give me a break!

319
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,320
What?!

320
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,800
But the Log Pose is
definitely pointing to the sky!

321
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,460
"The Log Pose is definitely pointing to the sky!"

322
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,940
Log Poses get broken easily!

323
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Hey, you got me there.

324
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,930
You guys believe in such an ancient
legend that there's an island in the sky?

325
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,140
Just which era are you from?

326
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,910
Unusual currents in the Grand Line
are being explained one after another.

327
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,120
The Knock-Up Stream is one of them.

328
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,590
I guess you probably don't know
something like that even exists.

329
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,260
The ships that fell victim to this
current are pushed up high in the sky,

330
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,550
and then slam into the ocean!

331
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,260
Without knowing this, sailors from long ago

332
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,310
saw the strange scene where the
ships fell, and imagined sky islands,

333
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,240
thinking, "There must be
another world in the sky!"

334
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,560
How foolish! All phenomena have reasons.

335
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,130
These things that people dream
about will all be explained soon!

336
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:32,300
Good grief! I thought I'd test you and
let you join my crew for the new era,

337
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,120
but you're such a delusional dumbass!

338
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,920
Listen. The era where pirates
dream about things is over!

339
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,520
The City of Gold, the City of Emeralds,
the big hidden treasure, One Piece...!

340
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,690
Those idiots who are blinded by dream treasure
don't notice the treasure around them.

341
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,810
In this era of oceans, those who should
be most capable of crossing the ocean

342
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,470
are misled by those illusions and die.

343
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,670
And people talk about
those dead idiots, saying,

344
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,690
"He was happy since he lived his dream!"

345
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,900
That's just drivel from losers!

346
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,660
When I see idiots chasing after
dreams like that, I get disgusted!

347
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,100
Luffy!

348
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,290
Since there're weak pirates like you,

349
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,780
it even makes us strong pirates look worse.

350
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,300
Get outta here, you scum!
We can't enjoy our drinks!

351
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,180
Bellamy's right!

352
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,880
Get out!

353
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,830
Get outta this town!

354
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,300
Hey, Bellamy! Looks like everyone
here wants to see your show!

355
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,860
That's no problem.

356
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,980
Luffy! Zoro! Forget the promise,
beat them up already!

357
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,760
Zoro...

358
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,340
Don't take them on, no matter what happens.

359
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:17,690
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

360
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:27,740
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

361
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:43,670
There are days where I almost lose to myself

362
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:52,100
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

363
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,230
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

364
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:08,570
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

365
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:17,410
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

366
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,540
This unique moment...

367
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,490
Hey, Luffy! Zoro! What's the matter?!

368
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,050
It's no use. Once men decide on something,
you can't make them budge an inch.

369
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,640
No matter how cool they act,
it's all over if they die!

370
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,590
You guys come and help us!

371
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,130
What? Well, we also ran into a crazy guy.

372
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,410
On the next episode of One Piece!

373
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,140
"Distinguished Pirates! A Man Who Talks of
Dreams and the King of Undersea Search!"

374
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
