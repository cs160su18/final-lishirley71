00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,530

WE GO!

68
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,520
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

69
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,180
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

70
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,670
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago

71
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,610
to go on to the next stage - the New World.

72
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,660
Did you know about this?

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,900
What is Soul King?

74
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,870
Oh, about Brook.

75
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,690
He might not...

76
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,450
...come back to do pirating again.

77
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,980
Look!

78
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,930
Oh, you guys!

79
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,400
This is Grove #46.

80
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,950
Rookies who have joined the
Straw Hats keep showing up here.

81
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,990
I see some captains.

82
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,130
"Big Guns Assembled! The Danger
of the Fake Straw Hats!"

83
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,250
Thank you!

84
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,030
Thank you, baby!

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,670
Oh, here we go!

86
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,010
45 degrees!

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,470
Thank you!

88
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,850
That was great!

89
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,440
--Here you go, sir!
--Oh yeah!

90
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,860
This feels great!

91
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,040
It sinks into my bones...

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Ring, ring, ring...

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,940
Ring, ring, ring...

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,430
Ring, ring, ring...

95
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,810
SABAODY ARCHIPELAGO GROVE #46

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,810
This is Grove #46.

97
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,480
A MEETING SPOT FOR THE STRAW HATS

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,310
There are more than 100 pirates here now.

99
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,360
If they all work for Straw
Hat Luffy, it's gonna be...

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,080
Hey, what's wrong?! Answer!

101
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,960
This is bad news!  Tell the backup to hurry!

102
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,240
Hey, hey, hey!

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,220
I was wondering who you were,
but you're a Navy soldier!

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,720
Oh gee!

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,100
What is going on here?

106
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,260
Oh! Oh! Don't tell me...

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,450
...that you just informed the Navy-san?

108
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,230
What?

109
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,200
He's a Navy soldier!

110
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,710
N-No, I haven't called them yet!

111
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,420
I was just about to...

112
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,380
Oh no, I don't want you to!

113
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,150
Otherwise, there's gonna be blood all over!

114
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,260
You and your friends' blood!

115
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,180
Isn't it right, Coribou?

116
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,550
Huh?! I'm sorry, brother, I'm so sorry!

117
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm here, you fool!

118
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,430
I'm sorry!

119
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,990
No that way, you dumb fool!

120
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,410
Caribou, the Navy soldier killer!

121
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,600
Enough jokes.

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,970
--He did it!
--He's true to his reputation.

123
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,280
Oh, gods, have mercy!

124
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,160
This silly Navy soldier tried to reach
his weapon and attempted to kill me!

125
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,200
Please have mercy on him!

126
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm sorry, gods, I'm so sorry!

127
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,780
Bury him, Coribou!

128
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,170
Bury this sinful Navy soldier alive!

129
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,810
Okay! I dig, I dig...

130
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,580
W-Wait a minute! Don't do it!

131
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,640
I didn't call for the Navy!

132
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,560
That's enough, Caribou!

133
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,360
Just dispose of that small-time
Navy soldier somewhere.

134
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,570
Here comes Captain Straw Hat Luffy!

135
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,600
You guys, look around you!

136
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,520
You probably don't know each other

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,250
but you are all gonna
work for me from now on!

138
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,000
As a crewmember of the Straw Hats!

139
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,610
That means when I become
the King of the Pirates,

140
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,890
you're gonna be a shipmate of the King!

141
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,060
To make that happen, from now on,

142
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,130
you guys should wait on me hand and foot

143
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,230
and fight for me at the
risk of your own life!

144
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,850
It's like a dream to work under

145
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,130
the unheard-of pirate
who caused trouble at...

146
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:21,990
...all of the 3 strongholds of the World
Government: Enies Lobby, Impel Down, Navy HQ!

147
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,830
He'll be one of the strongest candidates
for the King of the Pirates!

148
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,410
This is what they call
"getting on the bandwagon"!

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Most of them are here already.

150
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,380
Is that it?

151
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,640
Can't wait to see everybody!

152
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,640
Shut up!

153
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,160
We asked you to assemble here because...

154
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,990
...I've had my honor insulted - your
big boss who is important to you all!

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,790
The perpetrators have to be somewhere
here on this archipelago!

156
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,250
I want you to find them and drag them to me!

157
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,290
Consider it done, boss!

158
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,010
I won't forgive those fools!

159
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,450
Well, people change a lot in 2 years.

160
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,510
You guys don't talk much now, do you?

161
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,810
This mustache guy knows the
real Straw Hats as I thought.

162
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,190
Who is he?

163
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,820
I don't know but he'll notice so don't talk.

164
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,990
All we gotta do is take him to Captain.

165
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,200
Okay.

166
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,530
And I don't think you two
were ever so friendly.

167
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,290
But maybe 2 years has changed all that.

168
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,980
Your looks have changed also.

169
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,780
Are you guys wearing disguises too?

170
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,540
Hey, wait!

171
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,510
Encore! Encore!

172
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,020
Encore! Encore!

173
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,730
Encore! Encore! Encore!

174
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,840
I see. The Navy, huh?

175
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,730
I got it.

176
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,610
Don't push!

177
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,860
Soul King, come on now!

178
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,130
I need a little more time.

179
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,830
Yes... My fans are calling for an encore...

180
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,900
...and they won't stop so I'll go back.

181
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,070
Thank you for waiting, everybody!

182
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,580
There is something that
I have to tell you guys.

183
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,470
Today, I, Soul King, will...

184
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,520
This is it! The show is over!

185
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,730
The Navy? Why are they here?

186
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,230
The acting captain of the Rumbar
Pirates - "Humming Swordsman" Brook.

187
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,560
A 33 million berry bounty.

188
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,490
We suspect that you're this pirate!

189
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,940
In addition to that,

190
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
we have information that you're
working for Straw Hats Luffy now!

191
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,660
Soul King Brook!

192
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,790
No, Pirate Brook!

193
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,230
You're under arrest!

194
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,740
No, Brook-sama is not...!

195
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,840
Soul King is a criminal?

196
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,470
He's a pirate?

197
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,640
But I heard Straw Hat Luffy was dead!

198
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,350
It's all over, Brook.

199
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,150
I thought that you guys might be behind this,

200
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,110
Manager.

201
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,070
It was shocking to me when
you told me honestly

202
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,950
about your retirement backstage.

203
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,680
You've became very popular so we
were about to make a lot of money.

204
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,050
You betrayed us!

205
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,270
And our company will be out of business.

206
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,960
Let's die together, Soul King.

207
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,820
GROVE #17 THE ISLAND
WHERE THE SUNNY IS DOCKED

208
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,250
Cool!

209
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,910
Isn't it?! His body is amazing!

210
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,830
You're like a robot!

211
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,400
Can you shoot beams or missiles?!

212
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,170
What can you transform into?!

213
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,260
Yes! With the dreams and enthusiasm
of men riding on his back,

214
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,990
he goes into action now!

215
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,470
His name is...

216
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,770
...Armored Me!

217
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,820
Robot! Robot!

218
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,690
Calm down, Chopper!  Too much
excitement could kill you!

219
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,660
But, Franky,

220
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,160
you can't do detail work with
those huge hands, can you?

221
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
What did you say?

222
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,620
Whoa! A hand!

223
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,380
A hand came out from a hand!

224
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,710
Robin!

225
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,760
Nami!

226
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,090
You look great!

227
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,820
What's wrong with his body?

228
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,230
I don't know. I don't understand.

229
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,730
Oh, this is the coating?

230
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,300
Press my nose.

231
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,480
Nose?

232
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,660
Press it for a long time.
More than 3 seconds...

233
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,450
Please press the nose
for more than 3 seconds.

234
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,870
He tried to sound like a robot!

235
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,540
Exciting! Exciting!

236
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,960
1, 2, 3...

237
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,670
Whoa! Hair!

238
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
Hair...!

239
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,080
Can you set your hair?

240
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,590
Yes, I can!

241
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,340
--Wow!
--Wow!

242
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,010
Oh, Nami! Hey!

243
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,480
Okay, okay...

244
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,350
What was he doing for 2 years?

245
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,100
Can I see your weapon? Can I?!

246
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,820
No way! That's the main event -
you gotta wait for Luffy-mecha.

247
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,450
He moved like a robot!

248
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,280
He said "mecha" at the end!

249
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Guys.

250
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,170
Rayleigh-san! Shakky!

251
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,920
I'm sorry to interrupt your reunion but...

252
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,340
...there are things going
on on this archipelago.

253
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,010
Pirate Brook!

254
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,350
Drop your instrument and
put your hands in the air!

255
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,140
Band.

256
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,310
Backup singers and dancers!

257
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,190
I want you to support me for one more song!

258
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,550
Don't worry!

259
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,740
My music's got power!

260
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,450
Are you insane?

261
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,750
It's all over for you, Brook.

262
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,750
Manager, thank you for everything
during the past 2 years.

263
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,310
And thank you for bringing
me here to this archipelago.

264
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,090
We have a sad memory of losing
a fight on this archipelago

265
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,920
but this is where we start again!

266
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,140
I'm a musician.

267
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,260
My role in the Straw Hats is
to make the journey more fun!

268
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,350
People think Straw Hat Luffy is dead?

269
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,060
That's nonsense!

270
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,300
Tell this to the whole world!

271
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,670
The pirate - Straw Hat Luffy is alive!

272
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,340
He will become the King
of the Pirates someday!

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,050
Head Office, can you hear
me? I have some big news!

274
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,720
His departure shouldn't
be a quiet one! Oh baby!

275
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,760
Soul King!

276
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,680
Love me to the bones!

277
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,350
Yeah!

278
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,790
I'll dedicate this to my dear friends.

279
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,400
Listen to my last soul!

280
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,020
Yeah!

281
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,820
Luffy-san, let's go to the New World!

282
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,680
You fool! I said the show is over!

283
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,540
Shut up, Navy!

284
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,540
Let us hear one more song!

285
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,880
Let him sing it!

286
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,460
She's right! We don't care who he really is!

287
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,180
See? Music is always on my side!

288
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,640
1, 2, 3, 4...

289
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,560
"New World"!

290
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh yeah!

291
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,560
Kid!

292
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,410
This is the story of a hero

293
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,370
The story of a man who will become king

294
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,460
In war there are no "do-overs"

295
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,340
But he stands firm with
sandals on his bare feet

296
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,060
Oh yeah!

297
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,970
Come on baby!

298
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,500
Dreamers always struggle

299
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,500
Because sometimes their
dreams are out of reach

300
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:46,450
In order to live through the days in
which you have to battle your own demons

301
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:54,200
It's a big dream that seems quite a handful

302
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:01,880
But when he mentioned it,
I could see it coming true

303
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,360
Today is the day We got tired of waiting

304
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,530
We don't need nights because
we're short-tempered

305
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,340
Today is the day It's a great day

306
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,450
Kick the clock that was stopped

307
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:29,500
For the New world For the New world

308
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,960
For the New world The world is gonna change

309
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,890
One more time!

310
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,280
What?!

311
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,060
You fools!

312
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,670
I let him get away because of you guys!

313
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,200
He was a money spinner!

314
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,670
The Navy?

315
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,780
Yes, they think that the fake Straw Hats

316
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,780
are the real ones and
have started mobilizing.

317
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,760
I wiretapped them so there is no mistake.

318
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,700
I told Brook-chan what's going
on through the Transponder Snail

319
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,490
at the venue.

320
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,100
He's on his way here.

321
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,480
Oh, so he's gonna abandon stardom?

322
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,030
He has backbone as I thought.

323
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,950
Nami-chan, you're a navigator, aren't you?

324
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,110
I'll teach you how to operate
the coated ship so remember it.

325
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,620
Okay.

326
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,150
I'll try my best!

327
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,650
Oh, what is this?

328
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,530
It got tense all of the sudden.

329
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,500
But, Rayleigh, Luffy is not here!

330
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,380
Don't worry!

331
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,300
Captain!

332
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,050
Huh?

333
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,510
Call me big boss, fool!

334
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:12,500
We couldn't find the real pet but
isn't he the guy you're looking for?

335
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,930
Oh!

336
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,400
Luffy is here already!

337
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,740
I can't wait!

338
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,280
I gave Sanji a Baby Transponder
Snail when he came here.

339
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,740
He's with Zoro.

340
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,040
Oh, that's good because
you guys have to hurry

341
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,750
- the Navy will be here soon.

342
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,380
So it's only Monkey-chan that we can't reach.

343
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,170
But take this Vivre Card.

344
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,130
It will lead him to you.

345
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,450
Grove #42 will be perfect - it's on the sea.

346
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,760
Take the ship there and rendezvous!

347
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,480
It's a little busy but you
all got through these 2 years

348
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,210
and it's time for the new journey!

349
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,680
Only Luffy is still missing.

350
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,510
Everyone is waiting for the captain's return.

351
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,680
But Luffy got caught up in battle between

352
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,290
the Marines' Pacifistas and
the Fake Straw Hats.

353
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,440
The results of his two years of
training become apparent.

354
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

355
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,790
"The Battle is on! Show Them
What You Got From Training!"

356
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
