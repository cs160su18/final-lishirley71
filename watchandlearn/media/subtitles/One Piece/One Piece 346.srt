2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,350
Hey, Kumacy! Kumacy!

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,640
The Risky Brothers are
carrying the casket over.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,270
Get it from them and take the
casket to Master's dance hall.

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,210
Got that?

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,400
Did you get that or not?!

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,940
--Ye...
--Don't answer! You're so not cute!

53
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll be directing the Treasure
Retrieval Party on the ship,

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,490
so come get me if anything happens.
Do you understand?

55
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,120
That's right! You're cute
as long as you're quiet!

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,670
Take care...

57
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,340
Punk! You just whispered something!

58
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,630
That old zombie wannabe said that
Gecko Moria's had his eyes on us

59
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,640
ever since we were invited to this island.

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,770
Perhaps the curly cook's disappearance
has something to do with Moria.

61
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,520
That stupid cook! He had it coming.

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,210
But I never expected to run into
one of the Seven Warlords here.

63
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,700
Why would a pirate want
to steal people's shadows?

64
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,740
I would love to know!

65
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,910
I-I don't know anything!

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,790
I promised that geezer I'd kick Moria's butt,

67
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,210
but that'll have to go on hold.

68
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,460
Your missing friends are
already screwed anyway!

69
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,420
In fact, you're in no position
to be worrying about others!

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,440
Not anymore...

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,930
Quit oinking and lead the way,
you stupid piggy!

72
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,230
Usopp!

73
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,100
Chopper, look out! Behind you!

74
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,520
Usopp! Chopper!

75
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,110
You're in danger as well.

76
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,020
Don't hurt her!

77
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,630
Bastard! Why'd you attack an ally?

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,800
That woman is the enemy!
You're supposed to kick her butt!

79
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,680
I don't know who this lady is,

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,600
but even if it means
defying the master's orders

81
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,560
or sacrificing myself,

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I won't kick a woman!

83
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,980
Hey, Oinker! Did you pull another
fast one on us? Out with it!

84
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,290
Haven't I been telling
you that I'm in the dark?

85
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,990
Don't laugh! It gives the
impression that you're lying.

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,370
How strange. I wonder if he was
strangled so he couldn't utter a sound.

87
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,450
Why were your circuits
wired to be so ominous?!

88
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,620
This is so weird! Now Zoro's missing.

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,800
"The Vanishing Straw Hat Crew!
A Mysterious Swordsman Appears!"

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,650
Damn it!

91
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,080
I wonder what happened.

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,770
This is so strange.

93
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,120
Where the heck did those two wander off to?

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,660
Perhaps the ghosts were behind this.

95
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,910
I hope they haven't been executed.

96
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,790
If you have time to think
up all these creepy ideas,

97
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,170
figure out how to save them instead!

98
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,790
Where'd they go?

99
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,780
I can't believe Zoro and Sanji!

100
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,820
Jerk! Don't goof off at a time like this!

101
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,120
Hey! Isn't it every man's dream to don
a random suit of armor lying around?

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,580
Damn! It's every man's dream?
That's a solid argument!

103
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,040
Has that steel body made your
heart forget the spirit of wonder?

104
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,300
Cut me some slack! I never meant
to turn my heart to steel!

105
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,210
Yay! Sing!

106
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,270
Ever since I lost something important,
a draft has blown through my heart.

107
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,190
Please listen to "The Cyborg
Traveler's Steel Sentiment."

108
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,520
Do they understand the situation they're in?

109
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,190
Hey!

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,530
This opens up to a large hall.

111
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,320
Really?

112
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,540
Could this be...?

113
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,800
Robin! Where are Usopp and the others?

114
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,190
I don't know. In fact...

115
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,220
...this hall leads directly outside.

116
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,890
What's with this room?

117
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,930
It looks just like an arena.

118
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,890
If only it were that forgiving!

119
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:29,110
You oughta say your prayers!
You'll never make it outta this room.

120
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,950
Wha--?!

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
Franky!

122
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,130
Who are you?!

123
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,050
Wow! Moving armor!

124
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm sure it's a zombie.

125
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,790
It's moving with spears piercing though it.

126
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,440
Zombies shouldn't get all
geared up and spook people!

127
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,150
Strong Right!

128
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,050
The wall--!

129
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,780
Your swordplay can get a taste of my...

130
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,020
Weapons Left!

131
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,100
You were a pain in the butt!

132
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,970
What is he?

133
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,270
What?!

134
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,110
Wha--?!

135
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,570
Whoa! He took down Franky!

136
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,490
I don't believe it!

137
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,470
I'm not gonna lose!

138
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,550
Not to some corpse!

139
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,360
He's getting up again.

140
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,990
This is getting nowhere fast.

141
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,010
He's completely different from
the other zombies we've faced.

142
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,740
Let that be a lesson to you!

143
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,080
This is what makes zombies truly terrifying!

144
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,290
He managed to get really far away!

145
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,500
Even if we take some damage, it doesn't hurt!

146
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,750
All of the armed General Zombies

147
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,490
were robust warriors who made names

148
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,760
for themselves when they were alive.

149
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,180
One was a kingdom's Captain of the Guard

150
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,780
while another was a heinous criminal.

151
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,520
There is a legendary samurai,
a pirate, and a gunslinger!

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,480
These monsters are as good as immortal!

153
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,520
You losers don't stand a chance.

154
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,860
None of your pals are okay!
How do ya like that?!

155
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,150
You bastard!

156
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,280
Wall Zombie!

157
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,280
On it!

158
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
Gah! They blocked the path!

159
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,000
The path behind us is not the
only one that has been cut off.

160
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,770
Based off of my experience,

161
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,980
I'd say these guys are definitely
more than we bargained for.

162
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,060
There is a whole bunch of armor!

163
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,980
I went nuts against one
and it hardly did a thing.

164
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,240
We're just gonna burn through energy
if we take all of these guys on.

165
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,120
Yeah, I guess you have a point.

166
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
It's not like this is the last battle.

167
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,820
If we make it out of this hall,
we should enter the inner courtyard.

168
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,390
Great! Then let's meet up in the courtyard!

169
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,420
I don't want anyone else
going missing, so be careful!

170
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,980
Right.

171
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,980
Charge!

172
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,430
Let's go!

173
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,680
Yeah!

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Lola!

175
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,520
Where the heck did she go?

176
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,700
Lola!

177
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,500
Ab-sama!

178
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,700
Kissy! Kissy! Kissy!

179
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,200
Kissy! Kissy-po-po-po! Kissy-po!

180
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,040
Knock it off, Lola!

181
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,790
Please give up on me!

182
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,380
Didn't I tell you that I'm
going to marry this woman?

183
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,470
Ab-sama, you belong to me and only me!

184
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,190
I won't show any mercy, Cat Burglar!

185
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,520
Stop it, Lola!

186
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,400
I'll crush the life outta her!

187
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,490
Don't!

188
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,490
I won't go easy on anyone
who tries to harm the lady!

189
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,210
What's going on here?

190
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,830
Isn't that dog-penguin hybrid our enemy?

191
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,550
The fighting style he just used...

192
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,200
He couldn't be...

193
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,880
Bastard!

194
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,200
Rookie, you're stepping way out of line!

195
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,100
That woman is the enemy!

196
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,970
What is wrong with you?!

197
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:51,030
I will beat table manners into anyone
uncouth enough to harm a lady...

198
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,490
...you damn zombies!

199
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm sure of it! That dog-penguin is...

200
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,890
This ship belongs to Straw Hat, the man
who defeated Crocodile, and his crew...

201
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,430
I can't wait to see what type of
treasure they're lugging around!

202
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,610
Hey! Lemme outta here!

203
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,820
Isn't anyone around?

204
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,290
At least gimme a response, dammit!

205
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,560
It's so dark I can't see a thing!

206
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,380
Where the heck am I?

207
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,530
Who're you?!

208
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,220
Hey! Put me down! What're you doing?!

209
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,870
Who the hell are you?

210
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,510
Answer me!

211
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,060
What's with this light?

212
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,600
Hey! What're you doing?

213
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,770
Wh... What?!

214
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,880
Strong Right!

215
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Don't get a big head!

216
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,570
Treinta Fleurs!

217
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,980
Move it!

218
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,800
Great! Now's my chance!

219
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,720
Gosh darn it! Zombies shouldn't
be givin' us a hard time!

220
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,990
Clutch!

221
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,320
Don't get in our way.

222
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,710
It looks like they won't let us
walk through without a fight.

223
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,890
Damn it!

224
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,650
No matter how many times I
take them down, they get right back up!

225
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,740
Dang, they're persistent!

226
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,410
Gum-Gum...

227
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,820
...Gatling!

228
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,230
One-Sword Style...

229
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,550
...Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

230
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,850
That move... Zoro?!

231
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,350
Hey, Zoro! What was that for?!

232
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,190
That was dangerous!

233
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,210
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame!

234
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,720
But I am covered in scars.

235
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,100
Who're you? Are you actually Zoro?

236
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,810
My name is Jigoro!

237
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,680
Jigoro? What, so you aren't Zoro?

238
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,850
How come you were able to use Zoro's attack?

239
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,520
I've had enough of your yapping, pirate!

240
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,110
You're my foe, aren't you?

241
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,950
I'm gonna slice you in half!

242
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,740
You really sound just like Zoro!

243
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,160
You're practically identical!

244
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,550
That was close! Take this!

245
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,660
Damn it! There's no end to them!

246
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,070
Franky!

247
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,030
Grab on!

248
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,830
Dang! They're really persistent!

249
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,590
I've got the perfect thing for zombies!

250
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,740
Fresh Fire!

251
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,930
Prepare the buckets!

252
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
What?!

253
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,970
Crap!

254
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,780
Once Fleurs!

255
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,280
Slam!

256
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,670
Where's Luffy?

257
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,970
It looks like he's still back there!

258
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,140
Even if we go back, I can't tell
where that idiot is with him in armor!

259
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,560
Damn it! He better not
have gone missing on us!

260
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,190
But we can't stay here and wait for him.

261
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,060
The zombies are hot on our heels.

262
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,100
Hey! Straw Hat!

263
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,160
That hurt, you bastard! Lemme out, dammit!

264
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,030
--What was that?
--Bastard, lemme out! I mean it!

265
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,540
I'll let you have it if ya don't
let me out! Open the lid!

266
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,750
--A casket?!
--Lemme out, bastard! I want out!

267
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,170
Open the lid right this second!
Lemme out right now! C'mon!

268
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,130
--That voice...!
--When I say I want out, I mean it!

269
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,850
It's Luffy!

270
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,170
Are you tellin' me Straw Hat is in that?!

271
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,010
--Let's go after him, Nico Robin!
--Yeah!

272
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,010
What's he doing?! Sheesh!

273
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,010
Did that idiot get caught?

274
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,650
Straw Hat!

275
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,140
I won't let you go after him!

276
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,020
Hey, hey! Monkey, monkey, monkey!

277
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,370
I'm the spider monkey that you were
talking about back at the harbor!

278
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,160
It's a giant spider!

279
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,080
This ain't an arachnid
anymore! It's a monster!

280
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,420
Lemme out, you jerk! Lemme out, dummy!

281
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,430
Open the--

282
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,250
And there goes another one!

283
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,530
Shit! There goes the casket!

284
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,980
What are you gonna do to him?!

285
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,390
Don't you worry!

286
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,890
You'll get to personally experience
what is about to happen to him.

287
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,600
I'd be more worried about
myself if I were you!

288
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,240
You're trapped with me in front
and the armored warriors in the rear!

289
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,590
With this, your crew is finished!

290
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,380
Hey, you're one insolent Wild Zombie!

291
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,590
Out of my way!

292
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,050
The small island is unable to
escape the whirling storm of love!

293
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,310
That's right! This is a Love Hurricane!

294
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,350
I've had enough of your nonsense!
Get out of my way!

295
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,440
I won't let you pursue that lady!

296
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,070
"Chivalry Remains! The Traitorous
Zombie Protects Nami!"

298
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
