00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm sick of this.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,360
When is this rain going to stop?!

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Hey, Usopp, have you got anything fun?

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Huh? I've got a firework we
could launch, but just one.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,280
Wanna do that?

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,170
Yes!

25
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,630
Don't do it.

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,140
What if there's a hostile ship
nearby, or something?

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,880
I guess you're right.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,440
What's that book you've been
reading this whole time?

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,020
Luffy is showing interest in a book?!

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,850
Huh? Something the matter?

31
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,650
N-No, it's nothing.

32
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,700
The book is called "Rainbow Mist,"
or "Niji no Kiri."

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,580
It's a novel, based on some
adventures this person had

34
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,410
in an unusual region of the sea.

35
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,920
Adventures, huh? That sounds interesting!

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,730
Unbelievable!

37
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,340
Regardless of how bored he might be...

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,550
The sea sure is a strange place, huh?

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,500
Hey, I saw an island.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,220
Really?! Yahoo!

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,350
What's with you guys?

42
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,770
It's nothing.

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,310
"I Will Make it Bloom!
Usopp the Man and the Eight-Foot Shell"

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,870
It stopped...

45
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,170
Then it's okay, right, Mommy and Daddy?

46
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,640
Okay, keep close watch on the ship!

47
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,710
Yeah, you got it!

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
Hey! There's a town!

49
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,150
Hey, wait up, Luffy!

50
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,260
A town!

51
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,340
It may be a small town, but it sure is lively.

52
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,470
We should be able to procure
a few things here, huh?

53
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,580
Usopp, are you going to do some shopping?

54
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,220
Good question.

55
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,870
Hey, guys, get a load of this!

56
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,720
What is it?

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,380
Don't tell me there are wanted
posters! No, that's not it, huh?

58
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,890
Oh, a firework festival!
And what's more, it's today!

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,600
Yeah!

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,620
Fantastic!

61
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,540
I haven't seen fireworks in a long time!

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,840
Well then, Nami-san, I shall be your escort.

63
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,580
Uh-uh, no thanks. Mind your own self.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,490
Fireworks, huh? I can't wait!

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
I haven't seen you folks around before.

66
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,460
Have you come to watch the fireworks?

67
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,250
No, that isn't why--

68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,740
Why, are these fireworks that well-known?

69
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,720
Yeah. It's a famous festival on this island.

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,260
They've been holding it
for 400 years, after all.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,720
400 years? That long?

72
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,540
Look. You see that tower up
on the mountain behind you?

73
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,390
The people who live in that house
have been making fireworks

74
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,420
for generations, since 400 years ago.

75
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,400
It's just an old man and a little girl
that live there right now, though.

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Oh? Then, does the old man
make the fireworks by himself?

77
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,400
Oh, no! He makes them
together with the girl.

78
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,770
They bang them out all
year long, just for this day.

79
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,120
It's really something.

80
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,490
Why does it take a whole
year to make fireworks?

81
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,720
You're so dense! You see...

82
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,360
There's all sorts of reasons.

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,210
If I told you, you wouldn't understand.

84
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,040
Oh, okay.

85
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
That's it!

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,880
It looked like we were
almost out of gunpowder.

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,920
I wonder if they'd share a little with us.

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,850
Who knows?

89
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,670
I'll be back in a bit!

90
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,510
Then again, I hope that nothing like
what went on last year happens.

91
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,060
Yeah, really.

92
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,470
Like what went on last year?

93
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,860
Yeah. Last year, at the fireworks festival--

94
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,440
Kadoyan! They came here
to have a good time.

95
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,110
No need to go out of your
way to tell them about that.

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,980
I suppose not.

97
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,280
Sorry, it's nothing. Forget about it.

98
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,300
Oh, yeah! We should tell
Zoro and Robin about this!

99
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,140
Yeah! Let's go tell Robin-chan!

100
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,390
Nah, maybe we should eat first.

101
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,290
How come?!

102
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,300
This is how a firework
of my making turns out.

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,680
I'll show this to them,
and they'll be so impressed,

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,490
and say, "if you're skilled enough
to make something this wonderful,

105
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,720
then please, take as much
gunpowder as you like, for free!"

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,760
I wonder if that will happen.

107
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,060
No!

108
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,480
Whoa, what a face you've got.

109
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,840
Are you really the head firework maker?

110
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,050
You betcha!

111
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm Boss Odama, the pyrotechnist.

112
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,290
In any case, I'm begging you.
You can spare a little, can't you?

113
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,630
You must have lots of gunpowder, right?

114
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,790
I don't have any gunpowder
to give to a greenhorn like you.

115
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,370
Now, be on your way, please. Goodbye.

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,160
J-Just a minute!

117
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,940
Please, decide if I'm a novice
or not after looking at this!

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,950
This is a fairly decent--

119
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,230
"14th generation Odama"

120
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,980
So round! So huge! So white!

121
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,340
Who gave you permission to
come across my threshold?!

122
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,930
Hey, old-timer, is that real?!
That's papier-mâché, right?!

123
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,300
What would papier-mâché be doing
lying around a fireworks master's home?

124
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,690
It's for real.

125
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,080
So, "this is a fairly decent" what, now?

126
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,330
Oh, nothing, really.

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,130
A three-gauge shell, huh?

128
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,860
It's pasted together a little loose,

129
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,670
but it's still pretty well put together, huh?

130
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,260
Why were you hiding it?
It would be a waste not to finish it.

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,840
Huh? Who are you?

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,940
I'm Kodama, the granddaughter
of Grandpa Odama over there.

133
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,730
Huh? You mean,

134
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,090
you're the girl that makes fireworks
together with the old man?

135
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,120
Yep, that's me.

136
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,180
I won't have you looking down
on me, just because I'm little.

137
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,760
I'm still pretty skillful, maybe even
as much as Grandpa here.

138
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,850
Ee-yow...!

139
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,860
Don't go getting carried away!

140
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,250
You were supposed to
contact the launch team!

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,840
I did! They're going to be here
shortly to carry the shells away,

142
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,210
so I thought I would
get them out, you know?

143
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,600
Before that, you've got
to prepare the mortars,

144
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,250
and get the wagon ready!

145
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,140
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,870
Okay, fine!

147
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,690
What's with you?

148
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,520
Don't just stand there, go give her a hand!

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,370
Why?

150
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,470
Just get going!

151
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,030
What was that all about?

152
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,540
He tells me to go away,
then tells me to help!

153
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,080
I give up. I'm leaving.

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Hey!

155
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,740
Fixing to slack off? Help me out, here!

156
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,710
Huh?!

157
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
You're not here to become an apprentice?

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,210
Of course not.

159
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,000
I just came to get some
gunpowder from you.

160
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,500
You had your own firework,

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,510
so I thought for sure you
wanted to be an apprentice.

162
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,680
I just made that one for fun.

163
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,020
I hate to admit it, but I'm
not up to working pro.

164
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,980
Yeah... but it's true,
that is well put-together.

165
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,970
You should hurry up and finish it.

166
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,970
Come to mention it, you said
the same thing before, too, huh?

167
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,410
What do you mean?

168
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,940
I thought it was already finished.

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Fireworks only become finished
when they blossom beautifully

170
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
in the night sky.

171
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,710
Which is why all of the fireworks in
the storehouse are unfinished goods.

172
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,630
These launching mortars, too.

173
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,720
They're not finished until
they're used as equipment.

174
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,100
There's something amazing about you.

175
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,380
It's like I told you. I won't have
you looking down on me.

176
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,600
So then, that ridiculously huge
firework earlier is the same way?

177
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,630
It's still unfinished, right?

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,120
I sure would like to see that one go off.

179
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,700
Last year, we tried to
launch one just like that.

180
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,970
Oh? There was another one like that?

181
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,880
Mm-hmm.

182
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,160
But it didn't work.
Our equipment was flawed.

183
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,300
You don't mean...?

184
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,480
My mommy and my daddy...

185
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,670
They died, a year ago today...

186
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,380
...when the launch of the
200-gauge shell went wrong.

187
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
This weather seems kind of weird.

188
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,370
Do you still hold the firework
festival if it's raining?

189
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,420
Mm-mm.

190
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,910
I guess it's no use, Mommy, Daddy...

191
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,360
At least get things ready.

192
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,390
What's no use?

193
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,060
If it clears up tonight, I'm planning
on launching the 200-gauge shell.

194
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,780
N-No! Fireworks aren't food!

195
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,270
Don't raise your voice, you dummy.

196
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,670
S-Sorry.

197
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,380
But you can't launch something
as huge as that on your own, right?

198
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,760
That's all right.

199
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,090
I asked the launch team
to help me out in secret.

200
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,210
Even so, it already failed
to launch once, right?

201
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,280
It's too dangerous.

202
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,990
That's okay. I want to do it.

203
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,380
It's not okay!

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,340
Are you trying to get the launch
team folks caught in it this time?

205
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,070
No, of course not.

206
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,820
They'll just be setting it up,
and then take cover.

207
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll take care of the launching by myself.

208
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,030
"By yourself," huh?

209
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,570
No, no, no!

210
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm telling your grandpa,
and putting a stop to this.

211
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,500
What do you think you're doing?!

212
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,520
That's what I was going to say!

213
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't go ruining my
Mommy and Daddy's dream!

214
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,500
Your Mommy and Daddy's dream?

215
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,920
That's right.

216
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,330
Our family has been making
fireworks for generations,

217
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,950
for over 400 years now.

218
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,720
--Hey, that's okay...
--Just let me!

219
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,690
Apparently, we once had the technical skill

220
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,530
to make and launch 200-gauge shells,

221
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,240
but at some point,
that tradition was broken.

222
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,310
It was my Mommy and Daddy's
dream to bring back that skill.

223
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,160
That's why, tonight,
I'm going to finish their dream.

224
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,500
I understand how you feel, but...

225
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,060
Hold on a second.

226
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,640
Why would you just blab
something like that to me?

227
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,550
Do you want to know?

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,370
You want me to keep
your grandpa occupied?!

229
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,600
Yes. The launch team folks will be
here soon to carry the shell away.

230
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,340
While they're doing that,
keep Grandpa occupied inside,

231
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,980
so he doesn't come out here. Please!

232
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,440
You dumb fool!

233
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,940
How can I help you out
with something so dangerous?

234
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,990
"14th generation Odama"

235
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,700
Because my Mommy and Daddy's
dream is still only half-finished.

236
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,590
I'm going to finish it for them.

237
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,690
Hold on a minute...

238
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,830
A prayer before launching?

239
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,480
A fine thing to do.

240
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,690
But that isn't what you'll be launching.

241
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,520
You'll be doing smaller ones.

242
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,690
The launch team... Why did you tell him?

243
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,050
Watch what you say.

244
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,660
They were thinking of you
when they told me.

245
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,310
Why?!

246
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Why?! After all the begging I did?!

247
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,410
Sorry, Kodama-chan.

248
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,630
But it's just too reckless.
That thing is sure to misfire.

249
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,690
You don't know that for sure, do you?!

250
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,340
I'm not afraid of that!

251
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,520
Stop it, will you?!

252
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,170
It's not as though they don't know
how those of us left behind feel.

253
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,220
This isn't what it means
to carry on their wishes.

254
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,440
Kodama-chan!

255
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Ah, that's it...

256
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, well, we'll get things ready.

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Yeah, if you would, please...

258
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,890
Say, you're getting ready,
even with the rain?

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,210
This rain will let up soon.

260
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,130
The wind is coming in from the east.

261
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,910
Kodama is the only one
who doesn't realize it.

262
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,430
Old-timer, has that structure
been there the whole 400 years?

263
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah. What of it?

264
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,190
I hit upon a good idea.

265
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,350
How about hearing me out?

266
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,220
These are graves?

267
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,110
Wow, they're funky.

268
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,780
Yo.

269
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,740
Mommy and Daddy, like I said,
if this long spell of rain ends,

270
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,790
it means that I have your permission,

271
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,350
and that I can launch the 200-gauge shell.

272
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,660
So then, does this mean I'm wrong, after all?

273
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,490
"It doesn't mean you're wrong. Kodama,

274
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,350
if you launch your own fireworks,
we'd be glad to stop the rain."

275
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,320
But then, Mommy and Daddy, your dream...

276
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,780
"Do you think that's all our dream is?"

277
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,900
"You are our dream.

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,430
Our dream is that you will carry on for us,

279
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,380
and become a fine pyrotechnist."

280
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,760
"Kodama, take your time, and
make your own 200-gauge shell.

281
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,760
You have an unlimited
amount of time, after all.

282
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,080
"Kodama, if you can bring
back the 200-gauge shell,

283
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,730
that will also make our dream come true.

284
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,750
"Let Grandpa take care
of our 200-gauge shell;

285
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,180
you keep on showing us your
beautiful fireworks up in heaven."

286
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,790
All right! I will!

287
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,200
And then, someday, I'll make my
own 200-gauge shell, you'll see!

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,550
"Thanks for understanding.

289
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,780
And now, as promised..."

290
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,810
How? That's amazing!

291
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,630
Just who are you?

292
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,190
Who, me?

293
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,350
I'm a messenger, sent from heaven,

294
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Usopp Angel.

295
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,070
Usopp... Angel...?

296
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,250
That's so lame!

297
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,740
Usopp Angel...

298
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,700
...thank you! I'll try my best, okay?

299
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,190
How pretty!

300
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,430
Ready, set...!

301
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,500
Oh, this is coming off nicely.

302
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,130
Though I have to admit...

303
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,800
By using the wheel on the
cart in the yard as a pulley,

304
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,760
he figured out the trick for dragging
that thing out of the storehouse.

305
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,480
Who would have thought that the
tower that's been here for 400 years

306
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,680
was actually the launch
platform for 200-gauge shells...

307
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,250
Just who is this kid, anyhow?

308
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,740
"14th generation Odama"

309
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,410
Here goes the rapid fire!

310
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,870
This is incredible!

311
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,770
Yeah, outstanding.

312
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,200
Is it ready?

313
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,060
All set!

314
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,280
Last one!

315
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,330
Okay, last one!

316
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,060
Right!

317
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,870
Here goes...

318
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,130
What was that shabby firework just now?

319
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,120
Huh?

320
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,310
That's how my first firework turned out, huh?

321
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,930
Okay, Old Man Odama!

322
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,220
Mommy and Daddy's firework...

323
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,800
To be able to make a firework like that,

324
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,310
Mommy and Daddy really were amazing!

325
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,820
I wonder if I'll be able to make
a firework like that someday.

326
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,490
Mommy! Daddy! Thank you!

327
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,300
Old-timer, can I have some gunpowder?

328
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,590
You dumb jackass!

329
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,310
I don't know anything about you.

330
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,520
Take as much as you want!

331
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,860
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

332
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:28,450
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

333
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:43,760
There are days where I almost lose to myself

334
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,760
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

335
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:58,240
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

336
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:09,240
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

337
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,550
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

338
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,400
This unique moment...

339
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,510
You're going to catch a cold dressed like that.

340
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,840
People who catch colds are people
who let their mind's guard down.

341
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,860
Well, I wonder if someone
somewhere is spreading stories

342
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,390
about Zoro, the pirate hunter.

343
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,040
I've never once called myself a pirate hunter.

344
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,920
On the next episode of One Piece!

345
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,280
"The Fabled Pirate Hunter!
Zoro, the Wandering Swordsman"

346
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
