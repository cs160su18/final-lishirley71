2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
So let's go

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
saa yukou

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Without stopping

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll keep getting back up

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
shinjita sono saki e to...

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,430
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,740
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,380
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,220
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,810
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,540
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,710
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,950
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,880
Inside the bay, the Whitebeards
are trying to get to the scaffold

64
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,070
but the Navy stands in their way.

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,800
And at the bay head,
the Pacifistas began to attack

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,730
the allies of the Whitebeards
to exterminate them!

67
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,840
Stop perpetrating this farce, Whitebeard!

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,750
I know about your deal with the Navy!

69
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,940
You have their assurance that the
Whitebeards and Ace will remain safe!

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,320
You have sold the 43 captains
of the allied pirates to the Navy...

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,240
...in exchange for Ace's life!

72
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,190
You know what you have done, right, Squard?

73
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,750
You thrust a sword into your father's body.

74
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,450
You're such a stupid son!

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
But I love you, son, even if you are a fool.

76
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,780
So, Squard, treat him kindly.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,820
I don't love him any more than any other.

78
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,530
You are all family to me!

79
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,860
He has never changed at all, Sengoku.

80
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,020
He shook us up very well.

81
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,530
How ridiculous to say that I sold my sons!

82
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,960
He gave the pirates the way out.

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,630
I should never underestimate that guy.

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,260
If you are a pirate, you pick what
you want to believe on your own!

85
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,570
Those of you who'll follow me,
lay down your life for it!

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,170
Be ready! He's gonna run wild!

87
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,620
He's the strongest man in the world!

88
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,450
"The Encircling Walls Activated!
The Whitebeard Pirates backed into a corner!"

89
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,990
Whitebeard's on the move!

90
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,810
Follow Pops' lead!

91
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,640
Clear the way for Pops!

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,980
Don't let them come closer!

93
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,110
Fire!

94
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,630
Whitebeard!

95
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,780
Activating the encircling wall!

96
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,250
Do it faster!

97
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,090
Yes sir!

98
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,470
What's wrong?!

99
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,770
I-It seems like...

100
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,990
...the ice inside the bay is blocking it!

101
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,450
Figure out how to fix it!

102
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,350
Yes sir!

103
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,570
What's going on here?

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,080
I was told that Pops had
sold us, the allied pirates,

105
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,890
to the Navy in exchange for Ace

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,970
and that that was all there was to say.

107
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,840
Then why does Pops...

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,650
...save us and keep fighting?!

109
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,430
It doesn't make any sense!

110
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,620
That's not what I've been told!

111
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,890
Damn Squard, he's been fooled
by the Navy and stabbed Pops!

112
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,840
That's so preposterous!

113
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
How painful it is!

114
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,610
If this is the truth...

115
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,010
I...

116
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,680
I...

117
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,680
I've done a horrible thing!

118
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,950
I'm sorry, Pops!

119
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,210
I'm sorry, Ace!

120
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,750
Squard!

121
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,520
Can you pay them back by crying?!

122
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,350
They played a dirty trick on us!

123
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,340
That old man is amazing!
He can fight even after being stabbed!

124
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,210
Anyway, I gotta focus on saving Ace!

125
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,350
Luffy-kun!

126
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,940
Jimbei!

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,850
Look at that!

128
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,450
They all went up to the plaza
while we weren't paying attention!

129
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,580
Hmmm! I have a bad feeling about this!

130
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,240
But the old man is in
the middle of the action now!

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,380
There is no time to think!

132
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,260
Yeah! Nothing will stop us!

133
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,680
Not ready yet?!

134
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,880
I'm sorry!

135
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,060
The ice is thicker than we thought!

136
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,730
Fire!

137
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,400
You alright?!

138
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,050
It's nothing! Keep moving!

139
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,430
Advance!

140
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,740
The wall isn't activated
yet! This is no good!

141
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,170
I'm gonna buy us some time!

142
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,310
Vice Admiral!

143
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm not gonna let you get to
the plaza, Whitebeard Pirates!

144
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,400
I-It's Vice Admiral John Giant!

145
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,640
You're standing in my way. Move it.

146
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,030
I lost my balance!

147
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,710
Vice Admiral!

148
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,000
The ground is tilting!

149
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,930
Don't get close to Pops!

150
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,530
It's worse than an earthquake!

151
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,890
Whitebeard!

152
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,360
Ow, ow, ow...

153
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,160
The sea is...

154
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,840
I can't believe this!

155
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,420
Not just the island but the sea is...

156
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,630
...also tilting!

157
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,370
How outrageous that old bastard is!

158
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,190
Luffy-kun!

159
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,260
Jimbei!

160
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,840
I'm going to pull you up!

161
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,340
Thank you! I appreciate it!

162
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,790
Don't mention it!

163
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,380
Doesn't that old man care
about his own teammates?

164
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,760
His crew knew what to do, they evacuated.

165
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,730
Are you alright?

166
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,610
Ouch... Was that the end of the world?

167
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,870
I can't believe it!

168
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,250
So this is what the
strongest pirate is capable of!

169
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,590
What deadly power!

170
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,320
But in the name of absolute
justice of the Navy,

171
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,770
I can't let you pass through here!

172
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,410
It's coming!

173
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,720
It will reach the scaffold!

174
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,590
Keep going and destroy it!

175
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,230
Hey! Is the scaffold alright?!

176
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,690
Did it reach it?

177
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,140
It didn't hit the scaffold!

178
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,520
What made it veer off?!

179
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,930
Look at that!

180
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,300
3 admirals!

181
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,930
This happened because
the walls are not ready!

182
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,350
Your damn ice is blocking it!

183
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,550
Why couldn't you just melt it, Sakazuki?

184
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,210
Damn!

185
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,520
I can't believe that they've
repelled Pops' shock wave!

186
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Don't be scared, guys!

187
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,960
Commander Jozu!

188
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,920
Let's charge them while they're off balance!

189
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,800
We cannot miss this chance provided by Pops!

190
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,010
Let's go, Whitebeard Pirates!

191
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,340
Advance!

192
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,230
Seems like they're all very angry.

193
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,000
How scary!

194
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,660
What's going on with the encircling walls?

195
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,380
I-I'm afraid...

196
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,400
Divert all power from the city!

197
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,250
Pass it on to the walls!

198
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,890
Yes, sir! Right away!

199
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,780
Ace!

200
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,040
Luffy!

201
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,650
I'm on my way!

202
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,420
Ace!

203
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,390
Full power!

204
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,030
Wh-What is that?!

205
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,210
Th-The walls!

206
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,320
We're enclosed!

207
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,470
What the hell is this?!

208
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,810
Take this!

209
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,430
Did it break?!

210
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,920
No, not even a scratch!

211
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,400
This steel wall must be very thick!

212
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,010
These steel protection barriers are what

213
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,540
they were calling the encircling walls?!

214
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,370
Damn! Aren't you gonna fight us, Navy?!

215
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,090
Hey, look at those!
They're all aiming towards us!

216
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,720
We gotta run!

217
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,140
We're enclosed! There's no place to...

218
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,720
There is a place!

219
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,390
Hey, what's wrong?!
It should be fully activated!

220
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,180
I-I'm afraid that the wall
can't lift the giant body of Oars!

221
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,420
It seems like his blood is
running down in the system

222
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,450
and making it less powerful!

223
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,060
Damn the Giant!

224
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,870
Oars! Y-You're...

225
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,060
What a guy!

226
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,700
He is still fighting, you know.

227
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,150
We have a chance to win!

228
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,650
We can't close it but...

229
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,540
...do it, Akainu!

230
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,350
Meteor Volcano!

231
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,640
He's firing lava fists into the air!

232
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,010
Wh-What's going on there?!

233
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,040
They vanished into the sky.

234
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,390
What's this noise?

235
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,200
What are they?!

236
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,960
They can't get away!

237
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,840
Melt the ice that they're standing on!

238
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,090
The Whitebeard Pirates
are trapped in the bay.

239
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,290
As the Navy's concentrated fire continues,

240
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,970
they try to reach the plaza
via the path Oars opened,

241
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,220
but the order to execute
Ace has finally been given.

242
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,380
What will Luffy do now?!

243
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

244
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,950
"Execution Order Issued!
Break Through the Encircling Walls!"

245
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
