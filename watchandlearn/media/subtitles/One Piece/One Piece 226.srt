2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Let me tell you just one thing.

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,070
Slow-Slow Beam!

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,150
Huh?!

26
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,070
Remember this good, Straw Hat!

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,750
I am Silver Fox Foxy, a man
who obtains whatever he wants.

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,960
I'll take the 160 million Berries
along with the gold.

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,460
This time for sure, I'll show you

30
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,890
that we, the Foxy Pirates,
are the strongest pirates!

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:52,610
"Fox"

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,650
"The Guy Who's the Closest to Invincible?
And the Most Dangerous Man!"

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,400
Boss!

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Porche!

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,070
Hamburg!

36
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,540
Those five all fell.

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,870
Boss, what're we gonna do now?

38
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,120
What else?! We're gonna
clear up the humiliation

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,500
of the Davy Back Fight by
defeating the Straw Hats.

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,090
Porche! Hamburg!
We're gonna go with Operation D!

41
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,680
It sounds fun over there.
I wonder if they're still partying...

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,350
Why don't you go, too, Doctor?
I can watch our ship by myself.

43
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,020
I-I'm in charge of watching the ship, too!

44
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm also studying. I don't wanna go at all.

45
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,990
Dammit! How dare you trick me?!
Come out, Split-Head!

46
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,330
Hey, cool down a bit, Luffy.

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,290
That afro is getting you all worked up...

48
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,090
Yeah, no doubt about it.
The afro boosts your spirits.

49
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,800
Like I said, what's with the afro?!

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
After we went through
the trouble of saving them...

51
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,680
To think that he returned
our kindness with malice...

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,970
Yeah! And he's trying to take
our gold, too?! That's unforgivable!

53
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,930
At any rate, that guy is too optimistic.

54
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,850
If we get serious and go on a rampage,

55
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,110
a ship like this will be shattered
into pieces in an instant...

56
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,020
If the five of us do it...

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,110
If the four of you do it...

58
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,570
Anyway, for now, we have to
figure out how to get out of here.

59
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,290
Considering how that Boss is,
I bet he's up to something sneaky!

60
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,210
It seems like we can get out from here.

61
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,380
What?!

62
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,750
What the hell is this room?

63
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,670
Choppy!

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,340
Where is Choppy?

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,340
Where're you hiding?!

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,470
Geez... If you don't come out,
you... will... be... punished!

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,190
Is something wrong, Doctor?

68
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,060
Nothing.

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,190
You jerk! I hate this kind of joke the mos--

70
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,570
Wait, Sanji!

71
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,190
Luffy...

72
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,330
Hey, you!

73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,530
Yes?

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,830
Where's Split-Head?

75
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,500
Huh?!

76
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,540
Oh, I don't know.

77
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,250
--Oh, you don't know?
--His cluelessness knows no bounds.

78
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,800
--Oh, no! Where did Boss go?!
--Why can't he see it?

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,090
--Well, if he's not around, he's not around.
I guess I'll go look somewhere else.
--Even for Luffy, this really takes the cake.

80
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,140
Looks like he's not here.

81
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Luffy!

82
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,970
Hm? What happened?

83
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,270
Luffy, take a close look at the face.

84
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,400
What about the face?

85
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,400
Are you... Split-Head's little sister?!

86
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,030
Argh! Enough with the disguises!

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,500
Ahh! You're Split-Head! I got fooled again.

88
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,250
I don't even feel like making a comment.

89
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,670
Take this, Straw Hat! Slow-Slow Beam!

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't you guys get it?! No one
can escape the Slow-Slow Beam!

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,260
Seriously, that beam's a real pain.

92
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,810
Yeah, seriously.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,190
Slow-Slow Beam!

94
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,650
--Nami!
--What?!

95
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,770
Hey, you bastard!

96
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,030
Idiot! Don't come this way!

97
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,950
Sanji-kun! Zoro!

98
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,780
Oh, shoot! It hit them!

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,280
Hmph! You dodged it well,
Straw Hat! You play dirty!

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,950
Hold it, you jerk!

101
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,040
Does he know what "dirty" means?

102
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,170
Hey, Nami! Let's go!

103
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,500
Okay!

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,590
Both of you, be patient for 30 seconds!

105
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,420
What?! Hold on a sec!

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,510
N-Nami-san!

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,640
--What?!
--There's something on the door!

108
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,520
Let's see... From here on,
women aren't allowed. It's a man's path.

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,860
What does this mean?

110
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,730
Beats me. In any case,
let's be careful moving forward.

111
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,410
Is something wrong, Doctor?

112
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,490
Nothing.

113
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,790
That was close.

114
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,080
Yeah, you got that right.

115
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,210
It looks like an ordinary passage.

116
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,430
Wh-What the hell is this?!

118
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,010
What's the deal with these guys?

119
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,270
Oh, I see. Underneath this
passage must be a jail,

120
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,650
and they probably got locked up there
for making blunders or something.

121
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,940
I-I can go through a place
like this with no problem!

122
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,570
Hey...

123
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,940
A-A woman!

124
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,530
--All right!
--It's been so long!

125
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,790
I can't do it! I can't stand being treated like this!

126
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,450
Leave it to me, Nami.

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,290
Usopp...

128
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,130
Since they've been locked up in
this dimly lit place all this time,

129
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,090
they must be vulnerable to light.

130
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,420
So if we use this flash ball,
they won't be able to see for a while.

131
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,380
We'll use that chance to
make a break for it, huh?

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,600
That's right. Close your eyes, Nami!

133
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,190
All right! Now, Nami!

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,270
Okay!

135
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,240
--N-Nami!
--All right! I got her!

136
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,740
Usopp!

137
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,200
--Ahh! Hey! H-Help!
--Let me touch her, too!

138
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,950
Got it! You're saying I should go on
ahead and not worry about you, right?!

139
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,830
--Ahhh! Hey! Hey!
--Ah, the smooth leg of a woman!

140
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,410
--Nooo!
--It's been a while...
--How soft...

141
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,170
Is something wrong, Doctor?

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,040
No, nothing.

143
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,090
That was close!

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,720
Hm?

145
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,720
Wh-What is this place?

146
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,390
Hey, Nami!

147
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,230
Hm...? Luffy!

148
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,270
What took you so long?

149
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,770
What're you doing in a place like this?!

150
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,360
What am I doing? I'm eating
rice crackers and having some tea.

151
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,940
I can tell that much!

152
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,530
I'm impressed you've gotten this far.
I'll give you credit for that!

153
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,240
However...

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, however, having Straw Hat stranded here

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,290
and you reaching here
are all according to my plan!

156
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,750
Why me?!

157
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,630
That's because you're a navigator as
well as an excellent strategy advisor!

158
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,210
If we eliminate you and Straw Hat,

159
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,380
the Straw Hat Pirates are practically wiped out.

160
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,680
Oh, I see.

161
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,310
Well then, shall we start now?

162
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,060
That's the spirit, huh, brother?

163
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,980
Oh, wow! We can finally beat up Straw Hat?

164
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,070
What are they?

165
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't know what that is,
but this one is Gorilla Pants.

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,080
N-No, it's not "pants"!
It's the Gorilla Puncher 13!

167
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,080
Here I come, Straw Hat! Gorilla Punch!

168
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,790
Go hide, Nami.

169
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,000
--Okay!
--Gum-Gum...

170
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,760
You haven't forgotten, have you, Straw Hat...?

171
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,420
That when your punch touches these...

172
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,840
...Pistol!

173
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,890
...it'll burn...

174
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,760
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

175
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,180
So you have?!

176
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,600
Luffy!

177
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,230
You should pay attention!

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,770
You are the prey of Mr. Donkey Kicker 18.

179
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,860
Hey, Nami!

180
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,740
Water! Water!

181
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,360
Oh, I see... I get it!

182
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,370
Oh, wow.

183
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,580
She's trying to get Boss to forgive them
by humoring Boss with magic tricks.

184
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,500
Are you ready, Luffy?!

185
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,970
The weather forecast is thunderstorm!

186
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Thunderstorm Tempo!

187
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,400
You fool! You thought you could break
the Gorilla Puncher 13 with lightning?!

188
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,490
You really don't get it, do you?!

189
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,160
There's no way you can break something
with rain if it can even withstand lightning!

190
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,620
We'll see about that.

191
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,040
You still don't get it?

192
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,750
Your punches don't work with this guy.

193
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,710
Gorilla Punch Golden Hits!

194
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,220
Fire can be put out with water!

195
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,390
Oh, no! What's he doing?!

196
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,880
Oh? Oh?

197
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,590
Gum-Gum...

198
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,090
...Spinning Top!

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,440
Boss! Please don't come this way!

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,320
Holy smoke!

201
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,610
Oh, no!

202
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,910
What happened?

203
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,460
That's Boss!

204
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,000
Boss won!

205
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,540
Guys...!

206
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,260
I lost.

207
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,560
See? You took so long
that we missed all the action.

208
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,730
It was because you got lost!

209
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,560
Hey, Straw Hat!

210
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,440
I lost in a fight between pirates,
so I won't whine.

211
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,860
Do what you want with us!

212
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,580
Yeah... Then... why don't you
let them be your crew again?

213
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,830
What? After they tainted the pride of pirates?!

214
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,790
You don't want to?

215
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,290
Straw Hat... You're such a...

216
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,260
Okay, then! For Straw Hat's sake,
you go scot-free!

217
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,220
B-Boss...

218
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,600
Now, go talk to them.

219
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,970
Thanks, Straw Hat.

220
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,320
Will you guys work for me again?

221
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,230
Boss!

222
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,900
Boss!!

223
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,950
At least, his charisma is something else.

224
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,910
Boss!

225
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,750
--It pisses me off for some reason.
--Boss!

226
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,500
What do you think you're doing, Sanji-kun?

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,040
Just kidding. I was just kidding.

228
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,760
Take care, Straw Hat!

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,840
You take care, too!

230
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,640
Oh, yeah!

231
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,600
--Ah, yeah!
--Stop it already!

232
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,440
You came around, Usopp?

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Chopper... Why am I...? Ahhh!

234
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Nami, you jerk! How dare you
desert me and go like that?!

235
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,280
You got it wrong, Usopp. The truth is...

236
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,540
Oh, I see... So that's what happened.

237
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,210
To think that he outwitted my plan...

238
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,170
He's our enemy, but I admit, he's brilliant.

239
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,880
Boss, what are we going to do now?

240
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,550
Are we going to find another opponent
to challenge to a Davy Back Fight?

241
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,840
What do you think?

242
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,810
Boss is cooking up a scheme again.

243
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,890
Listen, guys. Unless we defeat them,

244
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,650
"Fox"

245
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,650
we'll have to keep flying this
ugly pirate symbol forever.

246
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,610
If that's the case, there's only
one place we're headed, right?

247
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,280
Yeah!

248
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,530
I won't let you get away, Straw Hat.

249
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,950
Guys! I see an island!

250
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,460
Hmm...

251
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,540
Looks like it's an uninhabited island.

252
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,170
Ready the anchor! We'll land on the island!

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,510
Well then, go find some foodstuffs.

254
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,800
Yeah!

255
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,130
Listen. No rats or frogs, okay?

256
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,430
How self-centered you are. Once it's
in your stomach, it's all the same.

257
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,390
Hey, Sanji!

258
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,310
We got fish, shellfish, fruits...
We got a good catch!

259
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,440
Thanks!

260
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,480
Cheers!

261
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,700
Yummy!

262
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,280
Hey, Luffy! Don't stuff your mouth like that!

263
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,910
You snacked a lot earlier. I can't
believe you're still eating so much!

264
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,500
This still isn't enough!

265
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,620
With this amount of food,
we're gonna run out quickly.

266
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,500
Robin, you should eat now or it'll all be gone.

267
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,300
I'm almost done, so...

268
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
No! If you're always reading,
you'll become a worm!

269
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,550
They call it a bookworm, right?!

270
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,270
There you are, Straw Hat!

271
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,140
Guys, are you ready?

272
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,600
Yes, Boss.

273
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,810
We're ready.

274
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,110
Boss, they're all looking this way.

275
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,990
Don't be flustered. Any way you
look at it, this is an ordinary crab.

276
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,750
It's so obvious, it's unnatural.

277
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,670
Don't tell me it's them again.

278
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,500
They never learn, do they?

279
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,130
I wish they'd stop.

280
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,460
Okay. We're gonna destroy their ship!

281
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,720
What the heck?!

282
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,720
This looks yummy!

283
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Hey, don't tell me...

284
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,430
Yeah, he thinks it's a real one.

285
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,810
Argh! Let it go, Straw Hat!

286
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,110
Oh? It's trying to run away!

287
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,400
Dammit. Take this!

288
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,150
Now's our chance! Crab-Crab Punch!

289
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,030
This is finally the end of Straw Hat.

290
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,710
You're just a crab! How dare
you make me get serious?!

291
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,340
Take this!

292
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,220
Oh? Did you guys get eaten
by this crab? How pathetic...

293
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,060
Oh, just get a clue already!

294
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,430
Now, let's leave those guys alone
and continue with our BBQ!

295
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,730
All that activity made me hungrier.

296
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,690
Hey, that one isn't done yet.

297
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,360
Well, I like this way the best.

298
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,370
Oh, no! Boss, I'm hungry.

299
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,120
You idiot! You're hungry?!

300
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,750
And you call yourself one
of the proud Foxy Pira--

301
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,420
Thanks for waiting, Mademoiselle!

302
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,920
This is today's special lunch.

303
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,130
Oh, wow! It looks good!

304
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,800
Please go ahead.

305
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,640
Oh, wow! This is scrumptious!
Please come to our ship, Mr. Cook!

306
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,890
Oh, no! If you ask me that,
Porche-chan, I'll have to consider it!

307
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,110
You should definitely go. I'm begging you, too.

308
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,570
"Fox"

309
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,570
Hello. This is the communications room.

310
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,280
Hi, it's me. Boss is knocked out,
so please come and get us.

311
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,290
Don't worry. He's alive. Well then, see ya.

312
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,460
Mr. Cook! Goodbye! Your food
was very delicious! I was so moved!

313
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,460
You take care, Porche-chan!

314
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,630
Are you really sure you don't have to go?

315
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,550
Don't be ridiculous. If I'm gone,

316
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,270
who's gonna be in charge of
Nami-san and Robin-chan's meals?

317
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,350
Right, Nami-san?

318
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,560
Sanji-kun! Zoro! Let's go find
foodstuffs for emergency stocks!

319
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,690
Okay, Nami-san!

320
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,080
Hey, Chopper. Were you able
to find any medicinal herbs?

321
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,990
Yep. I've collected most of them,

322
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,000
but there may be even rarer ones on this island.

323
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
More importantly, something's
been bugging me for a while.

324
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,340
I wonder what this weird groove
is that runs down this path...

325
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,050
Come to think of it, yeah, I wonder what it is.

326
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,340
It looks as if a bicycle passed by.

327
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,930
Hey, hey. This is an uninhabited island, right?

328
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,520
This can't be a trace of a bicycle
when there's no one here.

329
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,930
That's true.

330
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,310
Hey, we're almost through the jungle!

331
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,360
We're suddenly out in a large open space.

332
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,650
Ahh!

333
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,860
What's with Chopper?

334
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,330
He's headed to that rock.
Is there something there?

335
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,580
Ahh!

336
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,370
That darn Chopper!

337
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,120
He must be trying to have that
huge mushroom all to himself!

338
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,040
Hold it!

339
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,380
What's the matter, Chopper?!

340
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,970
Looks like something happened. Let's go!

341
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,430
Ow, ow, ow... Hm?

342
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,510
Whoa! What the heck is this?!

343
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Ahh... Hmm?

344
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,690
A raccoon dog?

345
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,310
I'm a reindeer! See? I've got antlers!

346
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,570
Are you okay, Chopper?!

347
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,860
Who the heck is this?!

348
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,070
What happened?!

349
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,120
What's going on, Luffy?!

350
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,700
What's with you guys?

351
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,950
What's with you?!

352
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,040
Wh-Who's that huge guy?

353
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,920
Who's that guy?!

354
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Robin!

355
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,430
What's wrong, Robin-chan?!

356
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,850
Robin!

357
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,850
Wh... Why are you frozen?

358
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,810
Robin...

359
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,640
Oh-ho-ho?

360
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,570
Now, now. Don't be so bloodthirsty, guys.

361
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,360
It's not like I'm here on orders.

362
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,650
Since it's a nice day, I took a stroll here.

363
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,610
Orders?! From what organization?!

364
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,080
He's a marine. And he's one of the people

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,580
known as the World Government's
ultimate powerhouses.

366
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,540
This guy is?!

367
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,790
Yes... An Admiral at
Navy Headquarters... Aokiji.

368
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,050
Oh, my, my, you've turned
into a good-looking woman...

369
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,380
...Nico Robin...

370
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

371
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

372
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

373
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

374
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

375
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

376
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

377
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,090
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

378
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

379
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

380
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

381
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

382
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

383
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

384
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

385
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

386
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,540
Eternally... Eternally...

387
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,500
What's wrong?

388
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,340
There're only three officers in the Navy
who hold the position of Admiral.

389
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,760
He's one of the World Government's
ultimate powerhouses.

390
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Huh? Well, yeah, that's about it.

391
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,600
I finally found you, Nico Robin.

392
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,810
What're you doing to Robin?!

393
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

394
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,400
"Navy Headquarters Admiral Aokiji!
The Ferocity of an Ultimate Powerhouse"

395
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
