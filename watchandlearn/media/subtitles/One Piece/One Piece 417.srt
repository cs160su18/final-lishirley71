2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,950
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,380
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,610
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,480
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,450
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,390
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,630
Luffy was ejected from the Sabaody
Archipelago by Bartholomew Kuma, a Warlord of the Sea.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,900
Separated from his friends,

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,880
he arrived alone at the female-only
empire of Amazon Lily!

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,500
He gained the favor of
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,740
and was granted a ride to
the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,830
in a Kuja pirate ship due
to leave the next day.

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,120
Granny Nyon!

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,180
What's wrong, Enishida? Why
are you in such a hurry?

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,140
Snake Princess...

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,230
...has come down with an unknown illness.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,900
Curse the Pirate Empress!

60
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,240
Are you really not going to obey these
strict orders from the World Government?

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,250
If they revoke your title
of Warlord of the Sea,

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,250
you know what will happen to your country.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,540
"Love is a Hurricane! Love-Love Hancock!"

64
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,510
Big Sis! Hang in there!

65
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,310
Big Sis!

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,230
I heard Snake Princess is sick.

67
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,650
Oh, Granny Nyon!

68
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,950
You, wait outside for a while.

69
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,560
What?! But I have to hurry!

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,430
I know that!

71
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,460
I can't breathe.

72
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,750
The way she's clutching her chest,

73
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,880
I think there's something
wrong with her heart.

74
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,300
But I can't figure out what it is.

75
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,390
I've never seen symptoms like these, so
I don't know what to prescribe.

76
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,940
Snake Princess seems to be in a lot of pain.

77
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,650
She didn't eat a thing.

78
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,370
I can't wait to get off this island tomorrow!

79
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,320
I really wanna see everybody soon!

80
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,950
Tomorrow morning...

81
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,870
This can't be happening!

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,460
Mon...

83
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,830
Lu...

84
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,600
--Snake Princess!
--Granny Nyon, stop fooling around with her!

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,790
She's in agony!

86
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm not fooling around!

87
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,720
Oh my god!

88
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,230
I can't believe this!

89
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,150
What an untimely virus!

90
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,610
--A virus?
--Do you know what it is?

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,660
Granny Nyon... I can't breathe!

92
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,360
Am I... going to die?

93
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,660
Yes, you are.

94
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,880
--What're you saying?!
--Stop making stupid jokes, Granny Nyon!

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,340
The former empress died
from the same illness.

96
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,670
I heard the empress before
that died from this, too.

97
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,140
I caught it, too, but left this country

98
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,260
and survived.

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,780
Snake Princess, Monkey
D. Luffy is here with me.

100
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,290
Hey, Granny Nyon!

101
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,860
He wants to ask you a favor.
Can you at least listen to him?

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,900
--Big Sis is suffering!
--What are you thinking?!

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
She's standing!

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,890
Alright. I'd like to hear it.

105
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,910
How lucky he is, Monkey D. Luffy!

106
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,850
Will he move this mountain
that no one could move?!

107
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,720
Do you want something? Luffy?

108
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,400
I gotta ask you something!

109
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,650
Are you alright?

110
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,730
No sickness can overtake me.

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,730
There's a Whitebeard pirate named Ace who's
waiting to be executed. He's my brother!

112
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,650
I want to rescue Ace!

113
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,280
But I heard a pirate ship
can't make it in time!

114
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,960
Your brother is... that Whitebeard pirate?

115
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,050
Can you board the navy ship

116
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,750
and take me to Ace's prison?!

117
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,380
How self-centered can
you be? Straw Hat Luffy!

118
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,430
You know Big Sis's pain but you still
ask her to go to that abhorrent place?!

119
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,200
--How cruel you are!
--We showed you mercy and then you become arrogant!

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,520
This is why we hate men! Big Sis's
patience is wearing very thin!

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,230
Turn him to stone and
throw him over the edge!

122
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,910
So you want me to follow their order for
the Seven Warlords of the Sea to convene.

123
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,280
--Big Sis!
--Kill him!

124
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,290
If you want me to...

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,520
I'll go anywhere!

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,930
Good! Thank you! This way I can
make it before the execution!

127
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,300
S-Snake Princess decided to
go to the World Government HQ!

128
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,930
What happened to her, Granny Nyon?!

129
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,260
The Snake Princess is
suffering from lovesickness!

130
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,020
The former empresses died
from being burnt by love!

131
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,780
There is a saying around the East Blue:

132
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,670
"Love is always..."

133
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,760
"...a hurricane!"

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,010
What's happening to me?!

135
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,890
I don't think I can turn
down any request from Luffy.

136
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,850
I said I'd go without even thinking.

137
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,100
And I don't have any regrets.

138
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,100
That's what we call love!

139
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,490
Love?

140
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,980
The pain of thinking about
someone that you can't see

141
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,190
drags you down and leads
eventually to your death.

142
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,090
The former empresses fell
in love with some men but

143
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,540
because they were empresses,

144
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,200
they had to bottle up their feelings
and stay on this island.

145
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,620
In time, the pain was too much for them

146
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,500
and and in the end,
that's what took their lives.

147
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,430
But the decision you made to go
with him will save your life.

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,920
If you go to the World Government HQ and
keep your title of Warlord of the Sea,

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,470
it will save this country and help
Monkey D. Luffy at the same time.

150
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,110
What a weird fate he has brought with him.

151
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,020
Normally, there is only one way for
a pirate to get to the Great Prison

152
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,130
and that is to just get caught.

153
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,910
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring, clank!

154
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,330
It's me.

155
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,000
Boa... Hancock?!

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,310
I decided to follow the orders to convene.

157
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,870
However, there is one condition.

158
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
If you can't accept that condition...

159
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,680
All right, let me hear it - this
condition that you're talking about.

160
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,150
Luffy!

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
I thought that he was gonna leave tomorrow.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,660
I heard that they changed
where they are heading.

163
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,640
He'll get on a navy ship with Snake Princess.

164
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,670
--Luffy!
--You guys! Thank you for everything!

165
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,910
I'll be back with my friends!

166
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,100
Your friends?

167
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,510
Yes! I'll have Sanji cook for you.

168
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,010
He's a great cook!

169
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,680
You'll be surprised!

170
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,640
And there's a skeleton who's a musician!

171
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,050
A skeleton?

172
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,330
His name is Brook and when he sees a
girl, he always tries to see her panties!

173
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,390
Panties?

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,650
What's so great about them?

175
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,200
And there is a reindeer called Chopper and...

176
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,890
Oh, but is it possible?

177
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,660
Nami and Robin are
okay but this country prohibits men...

178
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,260
They'll make an exception for your friends.

179
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,820
Snake Princess seems to favor you.

180
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,980
We'll look forward to seeing them!

181
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,720
She's here!

182
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,180
Who put these things here? They're in my way!

183
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,650
A puppy and...

184
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,190
...a baby seal!

185
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,290
It's Snake Princess!

186
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,370
There's no end to her sexual allure!

187
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,700
I don't know why but her beauty
is even more striking than usual!

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,040
I am deeply sorry! I am
responsible for the animals!

189
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,900
Please be careful.

190
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,840
Hey, sorry to put you on such short notice!

191
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,510
Snake lady, I wanna leave
as soon as possible!

192
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,390
Don't look at his eyes!

193
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,760
No, Luffy! It's rude to call her that!

194
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,020
Call her Snake Princess!

195
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,770
You can call me Hancock.

196
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,690
Snake Princess!

197
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,110
Alright, I got you, Hammock!

198
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,990
It's Hancock.

199
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,850
S-Snake Princess is smiling!

200
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,990
How many karats is that sparkle?!

201
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,310
It's too dazzling...

202
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,440
A woman in love! I was once like that...

203
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,380
What's wrong, Granny Nyon?!
That face is so creepy.

204
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,840
Shut up!

205
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,960
Have a good trip, Snake Princess!

206
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,100
--We'll see you, Luffy!
--Luffy-chan!

207
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,890
See you!

208
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,130
Cut that out!

209
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,940
Come see us, really!

210
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,360
We're all looking forward
to seeing you again!

211
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,490
It's done!

212
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,340
I had no obligation to save you!

213
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,690
Oh, I'm so relieved!

214
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,930
I was worried that you were going to die.

215
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,510
Gum-Gum Belly-talk!

216
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Luffy! I hope you can see your friends!

217
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,130
Yeah!

218
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,870
Granny Nyon.

219
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,460
Snake Princess has no problem but can
Luffy get on a navy ship for sure?

220
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,960
Managing to get a 3 hundred million
berries price on his head,

221
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,680
and then causing a serious incident
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

222
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,180
Monkey D. Luffy is a sworn enemy of the navy.

223
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,140
Is he planning to hide behind cargo?

224
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,880
Don't worry.

225
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,840
I gave Snake Princess a good strategy.

226
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,560
I've been waiting for you, Boa Hancock.

227
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,690
I told you about my condition
through the Transponder Snail.

228
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,150
I managed to get my superior's approval to
stop by at Impel Down, the Great Prison.

229
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,200
Is it only you and that snake
who'll get on this ship?

230
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,580
Even though you're a Warlord, pirates
are not allowed in that area.

231
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,880
We've made an exception for you

232
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,220
but we don't have time,
so we can't stay there that long.

233
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,670
I know.

234
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,000
Big Sis, please return safe.

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,220
Please come home alive, Big Sis!

236
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,890
We'll wish your good luck
in battle, Snake Princess!

237
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,180
Take care, Luf...

238
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm going now. I'll leave the country
in your hands while I'm gone.

239
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,520
Yes!

240
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,110
It was worth the wait.

241
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,620
It seems like I can fulfill my duty now.

242
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,880
Anyway, you were so adamant about not
wanting to assemble, what made you change your...?

243
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,480
People may fear you as a pirate empress
but after all, you're just human.

244
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,820
When you are hungry, your stomach growls.

245
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,600
Silence! As an empress, I have
better manners than that...

246
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,720
--Then, what was that...
--That was me!

247
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,340
Luffy!

248
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,270
Sorry. I couldn't eat enough at the banquet
since I was being chased by all those girls.

249
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,750
If we get caught now, it's all over.

250
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,160
I will ask for food later.
Be patient for a while!

251
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,320
Alright!

252
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,860
And it's getting hard to walk like
this. Can you climb up higher?

253
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,000
Like this?

254
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,170
Do you have a fever? You're flushed.

255
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,490
It's nothing.

256
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,680
Then, first of all, can you revert
my crew that you turned to stone?

257
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,350
We can't go back to Navy Headquarters
in this ungainly state.

258
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,940
Are they dead?

259
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,690
--What was that? It sounded like a man's...
--I-It was me!

260
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,780
The night wind is not good for your
body. I may have caught a cold.

261
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,200
Sorry, your hair tickled my nose!

262
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,450
It seems like he didn't notice.

263
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm not so sure but

264
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,380
you're not up to something, are you?

265
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,670
What do you mean by that?

266
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,470
You seem different than when
I saw you a few hours ago.

267
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,760
Did he notice?

268
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,400
I swear that both my body and soul are pure.

269
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,700
But if you have a doubt, why don't you
search my body with your own hands?

270
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,840
I'll allow it.

271
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,890
I'll let you.

272
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,490
What're you saying? That's too risky!

273
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,670
No. If you say so, I must believe you.

274
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,510
Take care of my crew.

275
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,460
Not only can we not make it to Impel Down,

276
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,640
but we can't even run the ship like this.

277
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,130
Wake up!

278
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,090
...cock-sama!

279
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,400
What happened?

280
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,240
Get underway, you idiots!

281
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,200
Y-Yes, sir! Right away!

282
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Before we return to Marinford,
we'll stop at Impel Down!

283
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,630
"Navy Headquarters"

284
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,580
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

285
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,630
We heard from Vice Admiral Momonga!

286
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,730
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock finally gave in

287
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,210
and they are heading here now.

288
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,040
Finally!

289
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,760
I hope she can make it.

290
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,780
That woman is strong.

291
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,070
Six of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea will be here.

292
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,640
Hawk-Eye Mihawk.

293
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,340
Bartholomew Kuma.

294
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,830
Don Quixote Doflamingo.

295
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,080
Gecko Moria.

296
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,740
Marshall D. Teech.

297
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,980
And Boa Hancock.

298
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,000
What about the last one
who was put in the prison?

299
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
Did he cool off?

300
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,200
No, sir. He seems like he is
still rigidly opposing battle.

301
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,930
He said he is ready for his title
of Warlord of the Sea to be revoked!

302
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,100
I assumed that he would be the most
cooperative and fight with us.

303
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,190
But he caused a commotion at the last minute!

304
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,940
Damn, Jimbei!

305
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,040
I have an announcement. Fleet Admiral!

306
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,680
The 500 pirates

307
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,530
Admiral Kizaru captured in revenge
for the Sabaody Archipelago incident...

308
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,360
they said they can't hold them at Impel Down.

309
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,240
Put them on labor!

310
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,540
Don't bring me any problems other
than ones related to Whitebeard!

311
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,420
And Saint Roswald, the World Noble, is...

312
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,630
Let the Admirals handle it!

313
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,220
Where's Garp?

314
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,220
Vice Admiral Garp headed
to Impel Down while ago.

315
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,570
What is that man doing?

316
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,840
Coming and going as he wishes
at a time like this!

317
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,510
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

318
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,070
It's an emergency! Whitebeard is moving!

319
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,900
Here they come! Is that from
one of the guard ships?

320
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,340
Put it through! I wanna hear directly.

321
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,120
No, but...

322
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,660
All 23 Navy ships which were guarding
against Whitebeard's main ship Moby Dick,

323
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,460
we lost contact with them
all a few minutes ago.

324
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,830
What?! What did you say?

325
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,550
I heard there was some worrying activity
by other pirate ships in New World, too.

326
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,820
If nothing is done,

327
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,200
we won't have any intel on how many
ships they have or when they're coming!

328
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,980
I already made arrangements for guard
ships to move in as replacements.

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,680
They've caught us off guard!

330
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,530
I didn't realize that they
were already on the move.

331
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,560
We don't know where they will strike.

332
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,630
Spread the word:

333
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,960
As long as Ace is there, a battle
may break out on Impel Down!

334
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
Yes, sir!

335
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,420
It's this way, Vice Admiral Garp.

336
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,970
Please be careful!

337
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,290
All right.

338
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,890
Oh no... this is a horrible sight.

339
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,770
Are you still breathing?

340
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,260
Ace?

341
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,450
Kuma's power has sent the friends far away.

342
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,320
Nami ends up on an island
populated by mysterious old men.

343
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,380
What is it that this
island's inhabitants study?

344
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,050
Meanwhile, Franky ends up on a different
island, where his body undergoes a change...

345
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,470
On the next episode of One Piece!

346
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,120
"The Friends' Whereabouts! The Science
of Weather and the Mechanical Island!"

347
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
