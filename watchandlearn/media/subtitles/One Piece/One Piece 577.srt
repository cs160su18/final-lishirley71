00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230
Since the day that the dream began

55
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

WE GO!

68
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,260
The Straw Hats have left the Fish-Man Island

69
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,090
and finally reached the New World.

70
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,320
But not before entering the
treacherous Maubeugemour Sea.

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,310
What's this weather?!

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,700
We're in the Maubeugemour Sea!

73
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,410
Momemomejuban?!

74
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,410
No, "Maubeugemour"!

75
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,410
Also known as the "Ill-Tempered Sea"!

76
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,830
Home to weather conditions you've
never seen or heard of before!

77
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,880
Arriving there, they met a Giant
girl who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit

78
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,840
and decided to help her save her father
- Panz Fry from the Navy's ship.

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,550
But I have to save Dad at any cost!

80
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,050
Before they take him to Impel Down,

81
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,690
this is my last chance to save him!

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,520
Lily.

83
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,390
Let me help you!

84
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,860
I wanna try that heavenly food
that only your dad can make!

85
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,350
However, a mysterious
group called the Neo Navy

86
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,490
is trying to kill her father.

87
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,590
Dad!

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,090
Consider that our greeting.

89
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,880
Surface and finish them off at once!

90
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,890
Yes, sir!

91
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,520
And a three-way battle erupted
between the Straw Hats,

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,940
the Navy and the Neo Navy.

93
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,600
Another bomb?!

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,730
Gum-Gum...

95
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,490
...Balloon!

96
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,040
Move!

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,780
A man?!

98
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,200
Outta my way!

99
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,750
Damn!

100
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,780
I won't let you do whatever
you like on this ship

101
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,920
while it's under the control of the Navy!

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,100
Pops' heavenly food is...

103
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,430
...all mine!

104
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:01,480
"Z's Ambition! A Great and
Desperate Escape Plan!"

105
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,760
Invade the ship!

106
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,130
We won't let you!

107
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,810
Kill the pirates!

108
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,830
A 400 million berry bounty,
huh? Are you a pirate too?

109
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,960
Then to hell with you too!

111
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,670
Leave it up to me.

112
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,300
Second Gear!

113
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,470
Gum-Gum...

114
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,360
...Jet Gatling!

115
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,700
Iron Body!

116
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,110
What a strange technique.
Did you eat a Devil Fruit?

117
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,690
I'm a rubber man.

118
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,200
But that wasn't strong enough
to break my Iron Body!

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,570
Oh yeah?

120
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,330
I said I won't let you do
whatever you like on this ship!

121
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,460
Roronoa Zoro!

122
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,670
Thank you for waiting. Let's
pick up where we left off!

123
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,680
Advance! Kill the pirates!

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,930
Party Table Kick Course!

125
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,690
Get ready to open fire!

126
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,780
He's an easy target.

127
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,410
Dad!

128
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,030
Treinta Fleurs Strangle!

129
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,290
Robin-chan!

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,570
Who on earth are they?!

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
Oh no! It's a big mess!

132
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,640
Hey, Nami!

133
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
I know!

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,350
I'm trying to think of the best
way to bring back Lily's father!

135
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,010
No! Is that the Thrust Up Stream?!

136
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,230
Bastard! Gum-Gum...

137
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,650
Both Luffy-san and Zoro-san
are on the defensive.

138
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,870
Those two must be very strong!

139
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,370
Take this, you monster!

140
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,790
Hey you!

141
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,580
Even though I'm a soul without a body now,

142
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,490
I'm not happy to be shot at!

143
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,380
There's no mistaking it! Damn! Not now!

144
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,410
Thank you for waiting! Nami!

145
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,590
Franky! We have a problem!

146
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,410
The weather's gonna change drastically again!

147
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,910
It's not safe here!

148
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,070
What?!

149
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,330
Everybody, listen carefully!

150
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,080
The Thrust Up Stream is coming soon!

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,130
--The Thrust Up...
--...Stream?

152
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,540
What's that?

153
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Is it something like the Knock Up Stream

154
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,300
that we rode to get to the Sky Island?!

155
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,390
Yes, it is! But it's not that big!

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh good!

157
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,970
But it could easily blow away a warship!

158
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,480
What?!

159
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,690
And once it starts erupting, it
could appear anywhere around us!

160
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,290
So return to the Sunny immediately!

161
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,300
R-Roger!

162
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,460
Armament Hardening!

163
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,960
Gum-Gum...

164
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,220
Don't you get it yet? Iron Body!

165
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,970
...Jet Bazooka!

166
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,560
What? Haki?!

167
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,570
One-Sword Style!

168
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,690
360 Pound Phoenix!

169
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,620
Franky! The anchors!

170
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,790
Roger!

171
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,210
You brat!

172
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,130
You have some nerve.

173
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,640
You too!

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,940
Sanji-kun! Lily!

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,090
Nami-san! I guess she's worrying about me.

176
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,650
It's not safe here!

177
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,530
Something like the Knock Up Stream is coming!

178
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,800
What?!

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,030
Did the anchors dig into the raft?!

180
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,920
Yeah!

181
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,350
Then, get away on the Sunny now!

182
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,160
--Okay!
--Uh-huh!

183
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,210
What happened?!

184
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,020
Luffy! Silly swordsman!

185
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,540
Let's get away from here with
Coup de Burst and her dad in tow!

186
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,470
Alright!

187
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,640
--I won't let you...
--...Do that!

188
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,650
Usopp!

189
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,030
Oh no, Luffy and the others!

190
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,160
Don't get in my way!

191
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,190
Th-Th-That was scary!

192
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,950
Yo, super welcome back!

193
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,420
Usopp!

194
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,410
Franky, use Coup de Burst now!

195
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,630
I'm afraid I can't!

196
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,940
Huh? Why?

197
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,360
I didn't notice until I got
closer but the raft is too big.

198
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,830
What the hell... Oh, what should I do?

199
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,250
Yeah! That just might work!

200
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,330
What?! Use the eruption of the
Thrust Up Stream to catapult us?!

201
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,780
There's no other way!

202
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,930
But you don't know if it'll
erupt at the right moment...

203
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,270
Shut up!

204
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,020
Sanji-kun, are the anchors still holding?

205
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,270
Yeah!

206
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,150
Hang on tight now! You
have to fly on the raft!

207
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,190
Damn! That was a little off!

208
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,790
Another one's coming.

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,710
Nami, not yet?

210
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,040
No!

211
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,630
Not yet.

212
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,420
Not yet.

213
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,300
Now, Franky!

214
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,890
Chicken Voyage!

215
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,440
Coup de Burst!

216
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,470
Luffy!

217
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,540
A flying ship?!

218
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,460
You can't get away from me!

219
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,470
Rescue mission accomplished!

220
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,930
Yeah!

221
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,810
Now, I get to eat that heavenly food!

222
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,980
Um... Don't forget about me!

223
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,240
He got away again.

224
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,800
Once we set our sights on
someone, he can't get away.

225
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,140
I can say the same for you guys
since you know our secret now!

226
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,080
Go to hell!

227
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,600
We've wasted too much time here.

228
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,620
Let's go after them!

229
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,700
What a fight! It's been
going on for 5 hours now!

230
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,870
--They're equal in strength?
--No, Shuzo-san has an advantage.

231
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,630
She doesn't have enough strength left.

232
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,220
I know you're suffering.
Let me finish this for you!

233
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,170
Did I miss?! No worries. I'll
get you with the next one!

234
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,230
What?!

235
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,690
Damn you Devil Fruit eater!

236
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,400
The battle is over.

237
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,480
The winner is Ain!

238
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,340
After that practice match,
Ain became Master Z's aide

239
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,390
and I became leader of this flying squad.

240
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,110
But soon, he will find out
which one of us is more suited

241
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,030
to be his right-hand person.

242
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,280
Looks like we got away
from the Maubeugemour Sea.

243
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,620
The weather is really different
from before. It's quiet here.

244
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,190
Yeah, we've come so far! I don't
see any ship coming after us!

245
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,290
Of course, you don't! That was
an extra-large Coup de Burst!

246
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,430
No one can follow us - even
with a high-speed craft.

247
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,680
We can hide behind these reefs
and catch our breath for now.

248
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,010
Uh-huh! How's it going there?

249
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,580
He's got a deep wound but...

250
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,280
but he's gonna be alright if
he rests for a couple days.

251
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,290
Thank you, Chopper-sa! I appreciate it!

252
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,850
B-Being thanked doesn't make
me happy at all, you bastard!

253
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,700
Anyway, I'm glad that he's okay.

254
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,670
So can you make the heavenly food, like now?

255
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,250
Are you a monster?!

256
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,990
Huh?

257
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,840
Why?! Chopper said he's gonna be okay...

258
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,940
You weren't listening to me, Luffy!

259
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,980
I said he needs to rest!

260
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,820
What? What about the heavenly food?

261
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,510
Boy, even if Lily-chan's father were okay,

262
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,500
we don't have anything to
make heavenly food out of!

263
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Oh, I got some food!

264
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,250
What?

265
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,870
Where? Lily, where is it?!

266
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,370
There, look!

267
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,730
Oh, there it is! When did you get it?!

268
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,480
When the warship blew away
earlier, food was raining down.

269
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,010
I thought "What a waste!" and
picked up as much as I could!

270
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,220
Excellent work!

271
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,470
But under those circumstances? How greedy!

272
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,390
Oh yeah!

273
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,120
Dad, Luffy-sa and the others were
in danger! What was I thinking?!

274
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,100
I got some sake too.

275
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,070
Excellent work.

276
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,060
Hey!

277
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,550
But even if we have food, frying
pan pops can't cook, can he?

278
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,890
Of course not!

279
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,360
I'll cook for...

280
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,060
What are you doing?! I told you to rest!

281
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,030
Ow, ow, ow... It's just for
a little while. I'll be fine.

282
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,230
Dad! Do as Chopper-sa says!

283
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,960
Your name is Luffy, isn't it?

284
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,130
Yeah!  I'm gonna become
the King of the Pirates!

285
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,300
Ow, ow, ow...

286
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,300
Dad!

287
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,990
Listen, Lily.

288
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,360
Dad?

289
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,380
Luffy wants so badly  to
eat the food that I make.

290
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,280
What an honor for a cook!

291
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,910
W-Well, I understand that. But...

292
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,300
On top of that, they saved our lives.

293
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,500
If I don't return the favor, I should
be ashamed of myself as a cook... No.

294
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,510
As a Giant!

295
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,880
Dad!

296
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,130
Now, bring that food here!

297
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,640
I'll make them my heavenly food!

298
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,590
Really?! Thanks, frying pan pops!

299
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,690
No, I have to thank you
instead. Thank you, Luffy!

300
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,570
Lily-chan! I'll make something too!

301
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay, I'll help him too! I'll
carry those bags of food!

302
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,990
Me too!

303
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,870
Sake! Sake!

304
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,170
You go and help them too.

305
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,920
Uh-huh! I will!

306
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,860
Shuzo-san, I found them!
They're hiding behind a reef!

307
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,950
How annoying! All ships, prepare for battle!

308
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,150
Let's blow them up along with the reef!

309
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,880
I-I'm afraid we used up all our
torpedoes in the battle earlier

310
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,740
and we're almost out of bombshells too.

311
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,500
All right. Then...

312
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,630
No, we still have a torpedo.

313
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,630
No, we don't.

314
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,130
We can use this submersible as a torpedo!

315
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,360
We are the proud soldiers of
the Neo Navy's flying squad!

316
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,690
We trusted in Master Z and
Shuzo-san and got this far!

317
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,730
Shuzo-san! Let us fight with you! Please!!

318
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,570
Me too!

319
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,110
Me too!

320
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,550
Me too!

321
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,390
I'm proud of you guys! I'll
care for you to your deathbed!

322
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,460
Fight to your heart's content
as a Neo Navy soldier!

323
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,470
All torpedoes, go!

324
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,370
I'm not gonna let you get away this time!

325
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,440
Damn pirates!

326
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,840
The Neo Marines have launched a surprise attack

327
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,800
and the Straw Hats begin their final battle against Shuzo.

328
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,050
Both sides deal blows

329
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,820
until Shuzo reveals his ultimate weapon

330
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,480
and unleashes it on Luffy.

331
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,430
As the shockwave hits the Straw Hats,

332
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,440
Lily takes fate into her own hands
and makes her decision!

333
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,000
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,650
"Z's Ambition! Luffy vs. Shuzo!"

335
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
