00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,830
I'm sure it was right around here...

18
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,630
Found it!

19
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,530
If things are going as planned,
Luffy and the others

20
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,670
should be headed back to
the dock with our gold in hand.

21
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,510
I'm sorry, I really did forget about this!

22
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,220
I didn't realize it before, but this
Waver works in the Blue Sea, too!

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,080
All right! Now we just gotta hurry back!

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,940
Sanji-kun! Hold on tight!

25
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,900
Onto you?!

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm so glad I'm alive!

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,420
God! Buddha! I thank you so much!

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,380
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just get on already!

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,510
Don't mind if I do, then!

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,220
You moron! I can't move like this!

31
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,700
Your expressions of love are dynamic!

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,100
I collapse and literally fall in love...

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,930
All right! Here we go!

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,040
Okay!

35
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,260
"The One Fell Swoop Plan!
Jonathan's Surefire Secret Tactic"

36
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,910
Looks like we've been had...

37
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,450
I have to hand it to them...

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,410
I wanna catch a fish that big!

39
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,330
How can you be so carefree after
we nearly died trying to open it?!

40
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,990
Our commander said you would appear here,

41
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,550
since you had stolen the map.

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,760
Cunning man.

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,770
There is nowhere to run now!

44
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,340
Dammit! As strong as Luffy and Zoro are...

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,660
Do we wait for Sanji and the others
to break through from outside?!

46
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,360
No.

47
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,590
Our actions should already be known by now.

48
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,130
It's only a matter of time
until reinforcements arrive.

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,940
There's no use in staying here.

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,270
Yeah! If the gold's not here,
then let's just go look somewhere else!

51
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,780
Don't talk like it's so easy!

52
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,070
The only way out is to beat these guys

53
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,470
and bust down those sturdy doors!

54
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,790
So?

55
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,470
Exactly! We gotta do what we gotta do!

56
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,010
In the name of Navarone, we will defeat you!

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,970
Usopp's in trouble!
He's helpless to do anything!

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,110
End of the line, Straw Hats!

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,110
Huh?

60
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,030
Condoriano?

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,280
You came to the storage vault,
exactly as I expected!

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,830
Who the hell are you?! Who gave
you permission to open the doors?!

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,670
Quiet, you!

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,420
I am a special inspector
from Navy HQ, Major Shepherd!

65
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,870
With the commander's permission,

66
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,000
I am leading a special
mobile unit from headquarters.

67
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,840
You are not needed. Step back!

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,810
Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

69
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,830
Oh, yeah! You were the guy
in jail with Usopp and Zoro!

70
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,940
Who are you to talk all big?!

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,290
Hey! Condoriano! You managed to escape!

72
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,900
You seem well!

73
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,100
I owe a great deal to you all.

74
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,860
All the insults you've put me through...

75
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,360
It's payback time for that, with interest!

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,330
Major Shepherd!

77
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,700
What?! Things were just getting good!

78
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,950
Taking them down with that level
of military might is impossible.

79
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,190
You shouldn't underestimate them...

80
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,280
Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Don't compare us HQ elites
with you pathetic Navarone men!

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,430
We will eliminate the Straw Hats!

83
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,110
You just sit there and watch! Is that clear?!

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,220
Yes, sir!

85
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,380
Are you done?

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,070
Yes! I'm gonna crush you good,
so stay right there!

87
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,300
Bring it here!

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,020
Yes, sir!

89
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,730
"Justice"

90
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,480
What's that?

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,380
This is Navy HQ's very latest
invention: a portable bazooka!

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,020
The Sea Eagle Talon-- the Eagle Launcher!

93
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,450
It packs as much punch
as a warship's main cannon!

94
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,370
What?!

95
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,800
They've brought out another incredible thing!

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,670
You don't scare me! Bring it on!

97
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,420
I'll fulfill that request! Time to die!

98
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,760
Huh?

99
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,790
Way to go, Condoriano!

100
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,350
Major! You have it backwards!

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,560
O-Oh.

102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Hey, now!

103
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,690
Shut up! I'll get you this time!

104
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,570
No! No! Don't do that!

105
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,190
Way to go, Condoriano!

106
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,940
What the hell'd he come here to do?

107
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,130
That's pretty disappointing
for a "special mobile unit."

108
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,340
Well, then. Shall we go?

109
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,640
All right! Gold! Gold!

110
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,310
Wait! Wait, you guys! Hey!

111
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,380
D-Damn you, Straw Hats! I'll get you--

112
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,730
My bad, Condoriano!

113
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,280
Don't let them escape! After them!

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,990
So, where's the gold now?

115
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,310
Don't look at me!

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,510
Security's tighter than I thought...

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,660
All alone with Nami-san
on a romantic night at sea...

118
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,130
Isn't it the damn greatest, Nami-san?!

119
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,990
Sanji-kun...

120
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,060
Damn bravo, Nami-san!

121
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,080
Sanji-kun!

122
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,140
You're damn fantastic, Nami-san!
It's bon voyage, Nami--

123
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,330
Sanji-kun! Could you be damn quiet?!

124
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,740
This means the Navy is certain
we're still inside the base.

125
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,760
But then why are they just
sitting there? I don't like this...

126
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,680
Let's rethink our plan somewhere safe.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,490
Is there any safe place here on Navarone?!

128
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,150
Yeah! The kitchen me and Sanji were at!

129
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,970
That's where loads of marines gather to eat!

130
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,260
We can't go someplace that dangerous!

131
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,320
No, wait. The enemy might
think the same thing, too...

132
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,440
All right! It's decided!
Let's go get some food!

133
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,780
That's not what we're doing!

134
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,840
I'm a full-fledged pirate
now! I've grown a lot!

135
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,130
I'll protect it, no matter
who comes! I'm a reliable man!

136
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,590
Chopper!

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,410
Nami! Sanji!

138
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,360
You're all right! I wasn't
lonely at all, you dummies!

139
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,370
Are Luffy and the rest not back yet?!

140
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,180
Nope! I've been keeping watch all alone!

141
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,510
That's strange.

142
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,250
Something might've happened...

143
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,180
Eh? Then, the gold, too?

144
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,940
Yeah.

145
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,570
I'm gonna go look!

146
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,250
My date with Nami-san, Part 2!

147
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,500
All alone again?!

148
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,890
You stay here, too, Sanji-kun.

149
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,410
Eh?

150
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,570
I have a favor to ask you.

151
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,990
I'm pretty sure the vault
was down here somewhere...

152
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,410
That's...

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,720
The Straw Hats fled into
the mountains! Comb the hills!

154
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
Hurry! No dawdling!

155
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you all right, Major Shepherd?!

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,640
Damn it! I almost had them, too!

157
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,380
But finding an empty vault doesn't
mean they'll give up just yet.

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,930
We still have a chance!

159
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,730
Empty?!

160
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,790
Well, I figured this might happen,
so the next step is already set.

161
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,930
I always know what I'm doing!

162
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,000
The vault was a trap!
Then where is the gold?!

163
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,080
I think it was around here...

164
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Hey, now. Come on already...

165
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,410
I guess it wasn't.

166
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,020
Weren't you just there?

167
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,850
The dining hall is at the far end.
This is the medical ward.

168
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,010
Sounds like there's someone here!

169
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,850
Dad! Please do as I ask!

170
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,880
I don't care if you are my daughter;
I refuse to drink that nasty stuff!

171
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,500
But it's medicine!

172
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,660
Those voices...

173
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,490
It's the doctor who acted as a hostage...

174
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,170
...and the old man!

175
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,080
The gold wasn't on your ship?!

176
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,460
Nor in the vault.

177
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,710
Still, I can't believe
you're father and daughter!

178
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,160
Anyway, old man, are you sick or something?

179
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,930
Nah, just one swig of this
and I'll sleep it off like a baby!

180
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,100
This is a much better medicine for me!

181
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,730
No! There is no drinking or
smoking in the medical ward!

182
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,340
Just one drink!

183
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,010
No!

184
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,890
You're so stubborn...

185
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,030
Old man! You need to listen to
your daughter-- no, your doctor!

186
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,270
What's this? Are you
trying to lecture me now?

187
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,030
I save your hides, and you
come waltzing right back...

188
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,480
Do you want your gold that badly, Long-nose?!

189
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Of course we do, old repair
guy! We're pirates!

190
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,200
Yeah! These pirates worked
really hard to get their stuff!

191
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,970
You keep out of this, Kobato!

192
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,890
We're saving up money!

193
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,810
Saving?

194
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,980
We decided that after we
exchange the gold for money,

195
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,420
we're gonna do major repairs on Merry!

196
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,550
Like we can really believe
a bunch of pirates!

197
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,940
I don't care if you don't believe me!

198
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,520
This was our decision!
It's got nothing to do with you!

199
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,870
What?!

200
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,540
I believe you!

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,890
After all... they said
that ship was their home.

202
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,230
Home, indeed...

203
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,090
This is it! It's a bit of a long way around,

204
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,270
but this path is unguarded, and it'll
take you safely to the mountains.

205
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,260
This "path" is almost all cliff!

206
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,770
All right, then! Let's go
gold-hunting! Thanks, old guy!

207
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Sure thing!

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,210
Get going.

209
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Thanks for your help again, old man! See ya!

210
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,270
Wait!

211
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,270
What is it?

212
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,790
Our commander's hobby is fishing, you see...

213
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,620
So that explains why he showed
off that huge fish painting!

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,790
Your gold is probably the
perfect bait to reel you in with.

215
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,030
In which case, it should be
dangling somewhere you can see it.

216
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,840
Someplace we can see it? Bait?

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Hurry up!

218
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,150
Yeah!

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,540
Now get going!

220
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,810
Right! See ya!

221
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,930
Hey! Wait for me!

222
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,440
If they do steal back the gold
and manage to escape,

223
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,100
all of Navarone will be in big trouble.

224
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,330
I must be crazy...

225
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,250
There was no time to think up
a plan after all, was there?

226
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,520
Dammit! Are we left to
look around aimlessly for it?!

227
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,200
What is it, Zoro?!

228
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,330
Thought I heard something...

229
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,930
A bug? Must be my imagination.

230
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,990
No, it isn't your imagination.

231
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,510
Something's coming!

232
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,590
A Waver?!

233
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,610
It's Nami!

234
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,260
I see. So you ran into Dr. Kobato...

235
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,730
We pretty much have no clues
about where the gold is!

236
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,490
I'm sleepy...

237
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,480
If we sit around and dawdle,
dawn's gonna come,

238
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,270
which'll make it even harder to move around.

239
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,690
Say, are there any other storage vaults?

240
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,840
If there are, they could be
traps to lure us in again...

241
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,990
Come to think of it, the old man
said something earlier about "bait"...

242
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,630
Eh? What do you mean by "something"?

243
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,640
I'm not really sure, but he said...

244
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,790
That's it! Usopp!

245
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,260
What's it?

246
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,710
Bait to reel us in... In other words,
the gold is somewhere in sight!

247
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,910
In sight?!

248
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,690
Could "sight" be referring to a
place we could imagine it being?

249
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,170
Oh, good thinking!

250
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,140
What do you mean?

251
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,560
In short, who's the one dangling
the bait to catch us in the first place?

252
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,820
Navarone's commander?

253
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes! Navarone's commander is the fisherman.

254
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,910
And if the bait is near the fisherman,
there's only one place it could be.

255
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,740
You don't mean--!

256
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,680
Yep, that's right!

257
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,320
What are you doing?!

258
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,910
You said you know where the
commander's room is, right?

259
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,040
Lead us there!

260
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,380
O-Okay...

261
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,840
Okay! Luffy and I will go!

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,730
Robin and the rest, get to the coast!

263
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,380
Chopper's group should come to get you!

264
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,730
Will you be all right?

265
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,030
The Waver can only hold two people.

266
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,770
Well, we're gonna get spotted
anyway, so it doesn't matter!

267
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,770
I'm gonna run it at full
throttle! You ready?!

268
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,730
Yeah! Anytime you are!

269
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,340
Here we go!

270
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,580
They've appeared!

271
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,310
Where is it?!

272
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,190
Let's see...

273
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,580
Hurry and find it, Luffy!

274
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,510
Up! Up!

275
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,440
Up where, exactly?!

276
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,390
Don't let them escape!

277
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,710
That's it!

278
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,990
Got it!

279
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,050
What a surprise this is!

280
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,340
What is that vehicle?

281
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,920
Is he the commander?!

282
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,930
Yeah, he's the old fortress guy!

283
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,380
I never imagined you would
make an entrance through there!

284
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,780
Cool, huh?!

285
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,720
This is actually a vehicle from the sky!
Only Nami can ride it, though!

286
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,990
Quit getting excited!

287
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,330
Yes! I'm sorry!

288
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,330
I've not met this girl before. Welcome.

289
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,610
Were you not pirates, I'd greet you
warmly for your boisterous visit.

290
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,900
It's a real shame. You're
perceptive and bold.

291
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,230
But daring can also sometimes
be called recklessness.

292
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,930
There will be no soldiers coming
to eat this time, Straw Hat Luffy.

293
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,440
But first! If there's no bait,
we have nothing to bite onto!

294
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,280
Where's the gold?!

295
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,390
It's hidden in this room, isn't it?
Couldn't you at least show it to us?

296
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,980
Yes. It's right there.

297
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,340
Right in front of me?!

298
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,260
Oh, here it is! The gold!
Nami! We finally found it!

299
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,010
It's not fake bait, I hope?

300
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,020
It's indeed the genuine article.
Check for yourself.

301
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,580
Okay, then!

302
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,590
Luffy!

303
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,560
It's true!

304
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,040
This is our gold, no doubt about it!

305
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,270
All right! Let's go now! Sorry for
the intrusion, old fortress guy!

306
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,530
Whoops, I think not.
You can't just take the bait and run.

307
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,030
Try not to be too rough with the lady, now.

308
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,690
Thanks...

309
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,430
Straw Hat comes first.

310
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,860
I'll beat the whole lot of you up!

311
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,250
A-Another weird net... I'm out of strength...

312
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,460
Sea Prism Stone!

313
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,980
Straw Hat is captured!

314
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,930
Excellent work. Now, then...

315
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,100
Not good! What do I do?!
There's gotta be something!

316
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,430
Wait, if these guys have guns,
I do have a chance!

317
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,520
Rain Tempo! Sprinkler!

318
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,700
Cool Ball!

319
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,360
That's cold!

320
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,690
Heat Ball!

321
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,690
It's warm...

322
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,920
I did it!

323
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,170
W-What the--?!

324
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,110
A cloud?!

325
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,850
Today's forecast calls for
clear skies and 0% chance of rain!

326
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,620
But cumulonimbus clouds may
suddenly develop in some places!

327
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,830
Please watch out for lightning!

328
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,450
What is this, Miss?

329
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,670
Thunderbolt Tempo!

330
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,130
Luffy!

331
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,640
Luffy!

332
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,220
Pull yourself together!

333
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,120
Thanks, Nami...

334
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,150
Hurry! Grab our gold!

335
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm not one to let prey escape
after hooking it once before...

336
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,180
I'll catch all of you in one fell swoop.

337
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,140
Well, Luffy?! See the ship?!

338
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,340
It's too dark to see anything!

339
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,080
Look out, Nami! A navy ship!

340
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,560
Say, it does look kind of like a warship...

341
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,690
There they are! Over here, Luffy!

342
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,490
Nami!

343
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,360
Nami-san! Are you all right?!

344
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,730
You just let Straw Hats who
were in your own room get away.

345
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,680
They even stole the gold. Even you
must admit this is a grave failure.

346
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,320
They will not escape my
clutches, Major Shepherd.

347
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,430
You still won't admit defeat,
after all that's happened?

348
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,790
No, I apologize. What do you say, Commander?

349
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,040
Why don't you sit there quietly
and observe my leadership skills?

350
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,510
I thought you had already had enough?

351
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,140
What happened earlier was
simply a minor complication!

352
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,430
I had already sent out my
special pirate subjugation squad,

353
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,480
separate from my main unit.

354
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,930
Oh. Then I think I will sit back
and watch you in action.

355
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,140
You're the captain of the Pinepeak?!

356
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,650
They will appear near the Sea Gate!

357
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,470
Just as planned, wait for them
to get drawn to it, then sink 'em!

358
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,110
Got that?!

359
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,010
Understood, sir!

360
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,580
Captain! We're about to
reach the ambush point!

361
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,720
All right! Do not let
the pirate ship slip by!

362
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,300
The minute it's spotted,
commence a full-scale attack!

363
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,640
That takes care of all the preparations.

364
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,930
Now to watch things from a high
vantage point. Place a pole in--

365
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,050
Could you please not touch that?!

366
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,760
May I ask you something?

367
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,730
I-If it's about how to catch pirates,
I can teach you anytime you want.

368
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,070
Wasn't this special squadron
of yours on the Pinepeak?

369
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,190
There seems to be one more ship...

370
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,560
Say what?! T-That can't be!

371
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,800
That's no Navarone warship.

372
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,990
No, it doesn't even look
like it is a warship.

373
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,700
W-What is that?!

374
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,560
Captain!

375
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,870
A warship-- no, a warship-like ship--
is approaching from behind!

376
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,330
A Navarone ship?
And what do you mean, "like"?!

377
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,060
I-I'm not really sure how to answer...

378
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,930
It's going to smash into us!

379
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,020
Stop! Stop!

380
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,120
Full speed ahead, Merry!

381
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,730
W-What the--?!

382
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,570
Thanks for the piloting! Couldn't
have made it this far without you!

383
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,640
Thanks a bunch! We owe ya one!

384
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,670
Don't let them escape! After them!

385
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,490
This is no time for that!

386
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,380
What?!

387
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,170
I-Impossible! To think they'd
use the Pinepeak, of all things!

388
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,400
Damn you, you Straw Hats!

389
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,760
Don't be so aggravated.
They're as good as caught in a net now.

390
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,230
Net?

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,400
At 9:00 pm, the waters of
Navarone bare their fangs,

392
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,700
and the final-- and
inescapable-- trap begins!

393
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Okay! Now we can escape!

394
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,400
Plus we got the gold!

395
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,610
We did it! We did it!

396
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,220
Okay! Let's rush straight to the Sea Gate!

397
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,040
Yeah!

398
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:25,540
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

399
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:33,640
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

400
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:46,190
All the answers are right here, pouring out

401
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:52,720
Rush forth, rush forth,
on the road opened before us

402
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,410
Let's keep moving forward! We can do it!

403
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,510
We won't give in, we won't give in,
even if the obstacle is big

404
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:14,090
It's nothing to be scared of,
we can overcome it

405
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,680
Attention, Straw Hat Luffy and his crew!

406
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,290
You've fought most valiantly against
the Navy's great G8 Fortress!

407
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,840
You've done admirably, but this is the end!

408
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Just give it up, Straw Hats!

409
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,270
We still have a chance!

410
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,840
On the next episode of One Piece!

411
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,210
"Farewell, Navy Fortress!
The Last Battle for Escape"

412
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
