00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,890
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:19,050
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,710
The feelings of those who are in anguish

23
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,950
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

24
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,250
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

25
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,670
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

26
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,570
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Zoro and the others take to
the Supersonic Duck Squadron,

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,490
acting as decoys, to draw away the
Number Agents of Baroque Works.

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,360
Vivi sets out alone to try
to persuade Koza and company,

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,300
but her voice is drowned out by
the cloud of sand surrounding her.

31
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,560
The battle between the rebel army,
which was attacking Alubarna,

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,360
and the royal army, which was
defending Alubarna, had finally begun.

33
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,580
"Alubarna Grieves!
The Fierce Captain Karoo!"

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,090
Vivi-chan is in danger!

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,350
Usopp, you go help Chopper.

36
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,600
Chopper?

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
Get to the southeast gate!

38
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,390
Vivi-chan, hang in there a
little longer, until I get there!

39
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,310
It's a rebel soldier!

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,350
They're here!

41
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,440
Rebel soldier? Me?

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,060
Ah, it's a royal soldier!

43
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,270
Shoot him!

44
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,440
Hey, now, I'm neither
rebel army nor royal army!

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm on the side of the ladies!

46
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,360
"Alubarna - Southeast Gate"

47
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,350
They've disappeared...

48
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,920
...all too quickly.

49
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,600
Where are Mr. 4 and
Miss Merry Christmas?

50
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,640
W-What is this?
Just who are these guys?

51
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,070
Who are you? You talk as
though you know everything.

52
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,830
Let me introduce you
to our number-four batter.

53
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,840
Number-four...

54
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,440
...batter...?

55
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,970
Whatever I can do... Right now,
I should just do whatever I can do.

56
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,800
I am... I am a pirate!

57
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,040
Die!

58
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,870
Princess Vivi!

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,580
This desert will be...

60
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,970
...your grave!

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
Un...

62
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,050
...deux...

63
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,320
...ora!!

64
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,670
Karoo!

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,820
Hm, hm... Still, you're not getting away!

66
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,570
Swan Dash!!

67
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,380
I told you, you won't get away!
Come on, wait up, I say!

68
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm going to gobble you up!

69
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,030
Karoo...

70
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,420
You shielded me...

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,010
You're in no shape to be running anymore...

72
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,860
No! If you go straight,
we'll be cornered on the stairway!

73
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,830
Hold it, I'm telling you!

74
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,740
Let me off, Karoo! I'm going to fight him!

75
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,460
Hold on, that way is the cliff!

76
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,600
Hunh? That's ridiculous!

77
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,010
What is this?! That duck is scaling
the sheer cliffs of Alubarna!

78
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,290
You dummy! Now, fall back down here,

79
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,740
and fall prey to my Ballet Kenpo!

80
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,800
It's a sign of our friendship!

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,470
Oh, what are you crying about, Karoo?

82
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,110
Leave it to us! Vivi is our friend.

83
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,870
What's going on?!

84
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,480
K-Karoo! That was amazing! You just flew!

85
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Mr. 2 can't follow us
after we've come this far.

86
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,080
That was sassy of you, duck!

87
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,610
Nothing is impossible for me!

88
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,050
Not with the relevé of my
kenpo's blood, sweat and tears!

89
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,380
Karoo, can you get
through this battlefield?

90
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,310
We can't find Koza
in all of this confusion,

91
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,920
so we'll go to the palace, to find Chaka.

92
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,870
Before the rebel army
reaches the center of the city.

93
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,060
I caught up to you!

94
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,440
A stray bullet...!

95
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,700
Karoo!

96
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,050
Vivi is our friend.

97
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,760
It's no use!

98
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,250
Karoo!

99
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,820
Karoo!!

100
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,500
I told you, it's no use!

101
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,890
All right...

102
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,440
You stay out of my way,
or I'll deal with you, too!

103
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,400
Stop!!

104
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,000
Y-You guys...

105
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,980
Nice work, Captain Karoo. You're the man.

106
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,540
Sanji-san!

107
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,680
You guys can stand down, too.

108
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,200
You have a rebellion to stop,
right, Vivi-chan?

109
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,060
I'll take care of him.

110
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,540
Are you the ridiculous transforming man?

111
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,500
You stay out of my way. Who are you?!

112
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,550
Go on.

113
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,510
Look after Karoo.

114
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,040
She's getting away!

115
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,020
You've gotta be kidding me!

116
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,980
You get to die!

117
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,620
Why don't I start by having you
return our sharpshooter's...

118
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,990
...prized goggles to me?

119
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,100
What?

120
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,710
I won't be done in like he was.

121
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,120
You're in league with Straw Hat?

122
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,680
Well, then, are you the fabled Mr. Prince?

123
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,790
Nope.

124
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,570
My name is Sanji. I'm a
first-class cook of the sea.

125
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,070
A cook? I happen to be a
super-first-class one myself.

126
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Cooks shouldn't defy
underworld organizations!

127
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,020
That underworld organization
bit goes for both of us.

128
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,250
I'm a cook, and a pirate.

129
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,700
An eye for an eye, is that it?

130
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,670
That's what it is. You keep
your hands off of this country.

131
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,430
"West Block"

132
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,310
Go! Go! Zoro! What are you waiting for?!
Hurry up and pound them!

133
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,910
You guys shut up and go hide somewhere!

134
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,760
Would you guys make this fun for me?

135
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,220
Go, Zoro! This is the only
virtue you've got, right?!

136
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,530
Hurry up and finish off...
those... ugly-looking...

137
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,790
What do you think you're doing? Huh?!

138
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,930
First rule of the guide to killing:
Eliminate the weaker targets first.

139
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,770
Let us show you how a pro works.

140
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,520
M-Me?

141
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,710
J-Just a minute! There's no
meaning in getting rid of me.

142
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,360
My face and style might be
outstanding, but I've got no skills.

143
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,570
I'm a non-combatant.

144
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,160
Didn't we just say so?

145
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,060
Starting by getting rid of such
is the fastest way to work.

146
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,750
Well, sure! Of course, you're right.
I'd do the same, myself.

147
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,550
I told you to shut up
and hide somewhere.

148
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,330
This is the southeast gate
that Sanji meant, right?

149
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,550
It looks like the fight is over.

150
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,850
Where is Chopper?

151
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,770
Chopper!

152
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,280
Hey, Chopper! Wake up! Hey! Come on!

153
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,010
Usopp... Thank goodness
you're all right...

154
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,350
Don't be silly! Are you all right?

155
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,850
It's nothing serious.

156
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,370
So...

157
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,360
...this is what remains,
after the Mr. 4 pair left, is it?

158
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,290
And here, I came to help you out!

159
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,930
That's too bad. I, the champion of
the seas, the world's greatest hero,

160
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,850
Captain Usopp-sama, wanted to
show off my fighting prowess!

161
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,390
They're still around here,
somewhere. Be careful.

162
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,800
What?! Tell me that part first!

163
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,580
What on earth is that?!
Nobody's even there!

164
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,660
They're under the ground.
Miss Merry Christmas

165
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,550
is a mole-woman,
thanks to the Mole-Mole Fruit.

166
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,280
A mole-woman?

167
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,820
The other one, Mr. 4, is a fourth-batter,
together with his dog.

168
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,210
Huh? That doesn't make any
sense at all. What do you mean?

169
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,900
Here it comes! Look out!

170
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,910
Are you okay, Usopp?

171
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,310
That was close! You saved me! Thanks.

172
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,430
What exactly was that just now?

173
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,500
Like I said, Mr. 4 is a fourth-batter,

174
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,980
together with his dog.

175
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,790
And I said, that doesn't
make any sense at all.

176
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,730
Ah, it's him!

177
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,600
A dog?

178
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,870
What is that?!

179
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,110
"Mr. 4's pet gun Lassoo, the dog-gun"

180
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,810
"Mr. 4's pet gun Lassoo, the dog-gun"
"(has a slight cold)"

181
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,500
O-Oh, no!

182
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,410
W-What?!

183
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,550
What?!

184
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,180
Here it comes!

185
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,120
Again?!

186
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,910
You have to run far away, Usopp!

187
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,080
Usopp!

188
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,120
Are you all right, Usopp?!

189
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,800
Like I said, what exactly was that?

190
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,770
It's a time bomb. It explodes
even if it doesn't hit anything.

191
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,800
They can calculate the time
it will take, and then hit them.

192
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,330
Or to put it the other way, they
don't explode until their time is up,

193
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,670
so I thought I could catch the
bomb up and throw it back at them,

194
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,940
but that ball is as heavy as a wrecking ball,

195
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,280
and isn't the sort of thing you can catch.

196
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,760
To be able to hit it with a bat,
especially at the speed that he does,

197
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,860
Mr. 4's strength is extraordinary.

198
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,200
Huh...?

199
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,780
Lassoo!

200
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,750
Just how many tons is that
bat that he swings around?

201
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,710
La...!

202
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,710
Hey, Mr. 4! Mr. 4!

203
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,970
You bastard, you! You 'tard, you!

204
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,770
What are you just standing around for?!
Let them have it, already!

205
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,790
Come on, and let them have it!
Get on with it, and let them have it!

206
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,550
Go on, and let them have it!
Let them have it!

207
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,680
Come on, get on, go on!
Have at it, you... you...

208
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,680
"Ba"! You "ba"!

209
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,990
There she is! The mole-woman!

210
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,740
She's a mole!

211
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,400
I haven't even transformed
yet, "ba"! You "ba"!

212
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,500
Chopper, you'll have to take it from here.

213
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,270
Bury my body at sea
when I'm gone, would you?

214
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,380
You just got done saying you
came to help me, you dumb jerk!

215
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,960
Now, look...

216
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,750
What is that dog-looking thing
over there?! You expect me to fight

217
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,910
against a mysterious life form
as inexplicable as that thing?!

218
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,950
I'm a human! Get it?!

219
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,620
I'm a human, too!

220
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Fool! You're a monster!

221
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,630
What about you, with that long nose?!

222
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,820
You shut up, bluenose!

223
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,350
Now you've said it, longnose!

224
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,810
Is this any situation for you
to be arguing like that? Eh?

225
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,700
Sorry about that.

226
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,630
His name is Lassoo.

227
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,190
He's a gun that ate a dachshund
model of the mutt-mutt fruit.

228
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,570
A gun?!

229
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,030
Are you saying that
a gun ate a Devil Fruit?

230
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,450
It's a new technique in the Grand Line.

231
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,990
Even things are able to eat Devil Fruit.

232
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,980
Ha! Don't be ridiculous! If he was
originally a gun, how could he move?

233
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,160
Devil Fruit doesn't have a will of its own!

234
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,810
And how does a gun eat
something in the first place?!

235
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,330
Shut up! What good will it
do for you to learn that

236
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,990
if you're going to die here anyway?!

237
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,750
Something can't help it if it moves,
you know, you "ba"! "Ba"! "Ba"!

238
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,010
Isn't that right, Mr. 4?

239
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,010
Listen up. You guys can't
escape this place anymore.

240
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,390
Not now that you've entered our territory.

241
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,670
You'll enjoy this. The territory's
name is "Molehill, Block 4."

242
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,160
S-She's turning into a mole-woman!

243
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,770
A penguin?

244
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,750
I'm a mole, I tell you! You "ba"!

245
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,880
She went underground!

246
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,290
All right, now's my chance!

247
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,280
Wait!

248
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,820
You can take it from here!

249
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,980
Watch out!

250
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,840
It missed!

251
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,730
A curveball?!

252
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,150
No!

253
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,030
It's above you, Usopp!

254
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,200
Fly ball!

255
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,330
Ha, no big deal!

256
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,810
I guess their cleanup batter
can't even hit .100, huh?

257
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,200
I can avoid this one
with my eyes closed!

258
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,100
Spin!

259
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,510
Look out behind you!

260
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,710
If he was just fourth up,
he wouldn't be called Mr. 4!

261
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

262
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,790
I couldn't even say half of it

263
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

264
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,650
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

265
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,020
Glory glory you're my shine

266
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,560
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

267
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

268
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm sure I'll make it there

269
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,320
They've gone into the molehills!
Watch out for the holes!

270
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,580
What are they planning to do this time?

271
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,990
Usopp! Behind you!

272
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,210
I have to think of a way to beat them!

273
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,180
I can't take any more!
We're gonna be killed!

274
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,660
There's no way we can take them!

275
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,660
No! We can't get away!
Not from these guys!

276
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,000
On the next episode of One Piece!

277
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
"Sworn on a Friend's Dream!
The Battle of Molehill, Block 4"

278
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
