2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,430
I'm a captain at Navy Headquarters!

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,090
I will not live on in disgrace!

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,330
I'll stop you guys
by slashing you in two!

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,230
I can't allow that…

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,170
...as our destination lies
beyond where you stand!

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,930
Bring it on!

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,480
I hate crooked sword attacks!

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,150
Right-Angle Flying Bird…

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,020
Three-Sword Style…

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,650
Bull Demon!

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,780
…Bone…

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,160
Phoenix!

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,610
He discerned it?!

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,880
Bold Hooves!

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,930
R-Roronoa!

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,060
He defeated Ship-Slasher!

18
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,700
To think that he
followed the sea train

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,950
from the detached cars
in this storm…

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,280
How admirable!

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,170
But we can't stop here.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm sure your justice is deep, too,

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,830
but we also shoulder
all sorts of things.

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,590
Hiss! You're the very definition
of "all bark but no bite."

25
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,270
Now, now, now, now!

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,690
Aren't you guys being
deceived by that woman, too?!

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,770
She's the lowest of the low,
who lived one betrayal after another,

28
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,860
and survived until today
in the underground!

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,570
I'll take your life!

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,950
Take this!

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,740
Decoupage!

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,070
If you like,

33
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,340
why don't you add your last
words to them while you're at it, buddy?

34
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,540
Ultimate Hammer!

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,790
Hey, where on earth
did you come from?

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,810
Yow!

37
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,170
Did you finish taking
care of the ramen guy?

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,610
Yeah, I did, just now.

39
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,840
It's suddenly become noisy.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,560
So the soldiers for this escort mission
were annihilated after all, huh?

41
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,390
We didn't expect much, though.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,690
They're the ones who
kidnapped Robin-chan, aren't they?

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,120
Be careful.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,900
They use strange martial arts.

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,960
Who's this?

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,970
He's probably that CP9 newbie
that Corgy was talking about.

47
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,340
If I remember right,

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,920
he's a Four Power
Master named Nero or something.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,780
Dammit!

50
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,930
You're gonna get it now!

51
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,940
People call me a fighting genius!

52
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,520
I don't care anymore…

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm gonna kill you!

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,610
Hey, newbie.

55
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,400
Y… You must be Rob Lucci, right?

56
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,620
Sorry that I didn't
introduce myself sooner.

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,410
Please wait a moment.

58
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,700
I'll kill him first and…

59
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,100
We're capturing Franky alive.

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,420
To think you let your feelings take
control and lost sight of our mission...

61
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,510
Well, forget it.

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,140
I'll give you three seconds.

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,210
So hurry up and run.

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,930
Three…

65
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,140
Run…? From whom?

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,760
Two…

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,510
What…? Hey!

68
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,720
You're kidding, right?!

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,020
One.

70
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,980
Stop it! Don't be foolish!

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,240
It's all right! Now
let's move forward

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,660
with the sun always in our hearts

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,040
As power passes through
our clasped hands

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,330
let's grab hold of our wishes

75
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,070
Working together,

76
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,820
let's ride the giant waves

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,210
Let's hurry toward the excitement--

78
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,540
there's the starting signal

79
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,630
Now's the time to set sail--

80
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,540
let's raise anchor

81
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,410
Cut through
the rainbow-colored wind

82
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,700
and head for a sea of adventure

83
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,500
It'll be a journey
fraught with injury

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,420
but what you cherish most
will be right there

85
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,420
And if you get into a jam

86
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,470
I'll always be there to protect you

87
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,640
It's all right!
Now let's move forward

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,180
with the sun always in our hearts

89
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,560
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,690
and gaze at the light beyond

91
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,400
If we gather up
the pieces of our dreams

92
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,700
they'll make a map
leading to tomorrow

93
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,120
So let's grab hold of our wishes

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,470
under the same flag--
together, we're one

95
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,790
One Piece

96
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,650
"Scramble over Robin!
A Cunning Plan by Sogeking!!"

97
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,650
I'll give you three seconds.

98
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,770
So hurry up and run.

99
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,650
Three…

100
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,770
Run…? From whom?

101
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,400
Two…

102
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,110
What…? Hey!

103
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,650
You're kidding, right?!

104
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,660
One.

105
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,870
Stop it! Don't be foolish!

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,030
Shave!

107
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,390
A person like you who does
everything halfway

108
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,910
is unfit for CP9!

109
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,160
Unless you've mastered all Six Powers,
you aren't superhuman, boy.

110
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,700
Kalifa.

111
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,370
Yes.

112
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,950
Inform our chief later…

113
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,100
...that the newbie was so
weak that he was useless.

114
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,320
Okay.

115
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,510
These guys are supposed
to be working for justice?

116
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,960
Can't tell which side is evil, huh?

117
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,230
Officials from the World
Government sure are ill-mannered.

118
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,770
This is my duty, so…

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,790
See?!

120
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,320
My sense of smell
is absolute, Nico Robin!

121
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,480
I want you to take off that cape.

122
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,710
Now! Now! Now!

123
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,670
Dammit! This is it!

124
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,260
W… Wait!

125
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,490
My name is Sogeking.

126
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,970
I'm the man
who hails from the island of snipers.

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,430
Soge?

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,190
Wait!

129
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,520
You think you can
get away with this?!

130
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,870
That's right!

131
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,440
Don't underestimate the resolution
of a man who is willing to go this far.

132
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,900
L… L… Lucci-san!

133
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,540
I guess I don't have to ask
why you are here, intruder.

134
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
Given the way you opened the door,

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,220
it doesn't seem like
you have a lot of patience.

136
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,430
Yeah, I'm ill-bred, so…

137
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,620
If this is about Nico Robin…

138
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,390
…give it up.

139
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,680
This is too big of an issue for you
guys to get yourselves involved in.

140
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,780
There are people in the world who
were born under an unlucky star...

141
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,990
People who are better off
dead for everyone's sake.

142
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,660
What are you talking about?

143
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,160
For example…

144
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,580
Suppose there exists a devil that
would burn the world to the ground.

145
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,610
If the person who
can raise this devil

146
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,550
is an innocent girl
who's only eight years old...

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,510
…don't you think…

148
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,770
…that someone

149
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,870
should kill
this girl for everyone's sake?

150
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,980
Huh? What's your point?

151
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm telling you
that is Nico Robin's life.

152
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,300
She is a real criminal now,

153
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,530
but it started simple like that.

154
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,360
Ever since she can remember,

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,070
her existence itself was a sin.

156
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,310
She can make others happy
only by disappearing.

157
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,180
That's the misfortune she carries.

158
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,040
Essentially,

159
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,140
she should've died 20 years ago.

160
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm really glad that this
woman will be put to death.

161
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Hey…

162
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,820
Enough of your crap!

163
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,750
You son of a bitch!

164
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,400
Don't say anymore!

165
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,700
However, the Government
will probably spend years...

166
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,350
…squeezing out all
of Nico Robin's knowledge,

167
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,580
experience and intelligence.

168
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,970
How much agony she'll experience
before she dies...

169
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,920
you just watch and--

170
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,880
We're not gonna let that happen!

171
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,070
Hey, hey, wait, Robin!

172
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,970
You shouldn't go that way!

173
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,930
Hey! Seriously! Seriously! Wait!

174
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Hey, I said, wait!

175
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,100
Whoa!

176
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,240
Robin-chan!

177
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,070
Th-This isn't good…

178
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,200
Good! Are you okay?!

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,940
Are you hurt?!

180
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,910
Oh, shoot!

181
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,130
When I went to all the trouble
of getting in from outside,

182
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,620
and even brought
that official down!

183
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,420
So that's Nico Robin?

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,620
She indeed bears a resemblance to
the picture in the wanted poster.

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,630
Let's go back together this time!

186
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,820
I'll bring these guys down
right away, so…

187
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,760
Okay, Robin-chan?!

188
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,730
Usopp!

189
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,790
What're you doing, Robin-chan?!

190
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,070
Ow…

191
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,000
Even if I explain, you guys
just won't get it, will you?

192
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,270
What're you doing, Robin-chan?!

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,160
Ow…

194
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,080
Even if I explain, you guys
just won't get it, will you?

195
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,480
Franky-kun!

196
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,040
Detach car #3!

197
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,900
What're we gonna do?!

198
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,610
We're gonna run!

199
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,770
Run?!

200
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,530
Hey, what do you mean?!

201
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,460
You, too, hurry up!

202
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,160
One moment will decide the game!

203
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,460
Don't let Franky get away.

204
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,330
Right.

205
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,380
Sogeking…!

206
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,630
Smoke… Star!

207
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,090
What a petty thing to do!

208
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,190
We got Nico Robin!

209
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,230
Hey!

210
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,770
Let me go!

211
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,610
All right!

212
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,120
Run!

213
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:05,050
Turn back!

214
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,740
Hey, he said we're turning back.

215
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,390
Oh, yeah?

216
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,550
That's a relief.

217
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,320
Well then, we should get
ready to turn back, huh?

218
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,590
Yeah.

219
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,270
What?!

220
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,230
Whaaat?!

221
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,940
Why?! When we came this far?!

222
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,460
What about Robin!
What about Usopp?!

223
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,660
Hey! What're we gonna do
about them?!

224
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,660
Dinner time?

225
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,720
What's that guy thinking?!

226
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
Straw Hat!

227
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,330
Why are we turning back?!

228
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,080
Straw Hat!

229
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,380
That's right!

230
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,040
Tell us why!

231
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,960
You've got it wrong!

232
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

233
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,210
I was telling

234
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,260
that frog that jumped
on the railway to turn back!

235
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,970
Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

236
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,430
It's Yokozuna!

237
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,890
Yokozuna?

238
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,350
What the heck is that huge frog?!

239
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,810
Watch out!

240
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,270
Step aside, frog!

241
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,610
Ribbit!

242
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,230
We're gonna collide!

243
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,520
All right!

244
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,620
We got Robin back!

245
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
At any rate,
that sure surprised me.

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
To think that we suddenly switched
to a "Running Away" strategy.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
A smoke screen is so stupid

248
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,520
that people wouldn't normally
think of using it.

249
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,210
It's best

250
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,310
if we can achieve our goal
without fighting scary guys like them.

251
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,960
But…

252
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,810
...I don't know if things
are gonna be that simple.

253
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah.

254
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,270
Don't let your guard down
until the cars are really far apart.

255
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,930
What the hell…?!

256
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,080
Thorny whips?!

257
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,250
I caught it…

258
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,920
Blueno.

259
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,050
Okay.

260
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,590
Is he gonna use the whips
to cross over?

261
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,010
They pulled us back!

262
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,530
What power!

263
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,190
A smoke screen?
What a worthless thing to do…

264
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,650
I guess it couldn't
have worked after all.

265
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,120
Don't kill any Straw Hats.

266
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,790
That was the condition.

267
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,290
Sogeking!

268
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,300
Ah, yes.

269
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,040
Protect Robin-chan
at all costs, okay?!

270
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,420
Hm…? Yeah!

271
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,380
Sorry, but I'm going to…

272
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,050
…make you let go!

273
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,840
Why is his body so hard?

274
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,550
I told you that they use
strange martial arts, didn't I?

275
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,940
Concasser!

276
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,060
He's got quite a heavy kick.

277
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,990
Iron Body almost got broken down.

278
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,250
Blueno, don't take him lightly.

279
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,700
He doesn't have a bounty on him,

280
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,210
but he's one of their main forces.

281
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,390
You just noticed that,
you damn jerks?

282
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,850
Whoa, R-Robin!
Hey, hold on a sec!

283
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,310
Ow… Wh-What're you doing?

284
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,180
Ocho Fleurs!

285
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,810
Clutch!

286
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,060
Long-nose!

287
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,190
Hey! Why, Robin-chan?!

288
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,580
How many times
do I have to tell you?!

289
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,370
Leave me alone!

290
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,990
Can't be…

291
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,920
Hey, pay attention.

292
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,090
Eyebrows!

293
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,980
Geez… Why are all of you
being so stubborn

294
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,940
even towards your friends?!

295
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,150
This is…

296
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,360
a perfect chance to run, right?!

297
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,420
Franky!

298
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,560
That was uncalled for.

299
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,290
Didn't expect that, did you?

300
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,930
Why are you taking sides
with them in the first place?

301
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,080
I just can't bear to watch
those guys act like that.

302
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,390
Not when there's a team that couldn't
go back even if they wanted to!

303
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,610
I wonder who you're talking about.

304
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,700
Yow!

305
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,400
You guys, don't worry about me!

306
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,780
I've got a plan!

307
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,070
Once you've joined up with Straw Hat,
get back to town somehow!

308
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,780
Franky!

309
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,720
Wait!

310
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,540
I won't run away!

311
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,500
Wait, Robin-chan.

312
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,000
Why are you acting
like that at this point?

313
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,670
We came to rescue you
knowing all the circumstances!

314
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,840
If we just do something about the
Government's attack, Buster Call,

315
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,670
there shouldn't be a reason that
you have to obey them, right?!

316
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,520
That Buster Call is…

317
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,450
…indeed the problem.

318
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,540
Wha…

319
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,400
We had a dream that day

320
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,220
Our belief in ourselves

321
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,250
makes us able to cross

322
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,920
the wildly surging ocean

323
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:44,090
You're braver and more caring

324
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,420
than anyone else

325
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,110
If you ever depart this ship

326
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,810
and live in a different world

327
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,700
In the end,

328
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,390
we can all surely smile

329
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,120
Stop it! Let Robin-chan go!

330
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,830
Robin-chan!
Why aren't you saying anything?!

331
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,670
Robin, you're still hiding
something, aren't you?

332
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,290
That's okay.

333
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,270
But

334
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,340
