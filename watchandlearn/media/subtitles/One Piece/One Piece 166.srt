2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,670
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,170
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,440
If you don't want to die, go back
to the Blue Sea immediately!

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,160
If you've got any funny ideas about
doing something on this island...

22
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,300
...we'll eliminate you along with Eneru!

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,710
Who're they?

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,380
So he fought this hard, even though
he gave us this whistle for free...

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,440
As pirates, we can't back off when
there's treasure close by, can we?

26
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,650
We've got enough enemies.
It's gonna be a survival game.

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,310
Alright! Let's do it! Gold hunting!!

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,890
"Festival on the Night Before
Gold-Hunting! Feelings for Vearth!"

29
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,890
Those beasts are problematic.

30
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,450
Can't we draw them away somehow?

31
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,950
Alright! I'll try!

32
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,670
Two... Three...

33
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,980
Laki!

34
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,690
What are you doing?

35
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Though I guess there's nothing you
can do, hanging there like that...

36
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,240
This is that important to you, huh?

37
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,840
Laki!

38
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,380
Run, Kamakiri!

39
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,660
I owe you one, Kamakiri...

40
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,850
Kamakiri!

41
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,140
Dammit!

42
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
Wyper! Kamakiri's been hurt!

43
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,030
What?!

44
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,200
Dammit! And we were so close!

45
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,370
How do you figure that?

46
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,710
Once night falls, we'll have
an even greater advantage.

47
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,060
Assist the wounded!
We're pulling back for now!

48
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,140
Meet back at the outer island!

49
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,070
I won't let you escape!

50
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,770
Wait, Ohm!

51
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,480
What is it?

52
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,070
God Eneru wants to see us.

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,260
What is it?

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,750
Those sounds seem to be getting farther away.

55
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,850
Yeah. The guerillas and priests are
probably going home for the night.

56
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,160
We better hurry and get back, too.

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,520
--Wait for me, Zoro!
--Hurry, or I'll leave you behind!

58
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,910
You don't know the way back!

59
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Man, this is boring!

60
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,080
Who told you to stare at it?!

61
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,530
Your only job is to put the distilled
water that collects in the container

62
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,060
into the canteens, so that we'll
have drinking water for tomorrow!

63
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,100
Still...

64
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,360
Sanji! We got lots of things!

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,870
Oh! Good work! What'd you find?

66
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,270
Walnuts, aloe, bananas, and garlic!

67
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,360
And rats and frogs.

68
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,720
Great! Toss it into the stew!

69
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,260
Hold it! There were some
weird ingredients just now!

70
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,060
You're right! How careless of me!

71
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,580
No garlic?

72
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,330
No! I wasn't talking about that!

73
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,680
What's wrong, Navigator?

74
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,000
Wow! Robin! What's that blue thing?! A gem?!

75
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Pretty, isn't it? But no, it's not a gem.

76
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,430
Oh, a salt crystal, huh?
That's a great find, Robin-chan!

77
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,390
I found it on the lakeshore.
I thought it would be useful to have...

78
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,900
It sure would! Salt is vital to
surviving in the wilderness!

79
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,600
I'll take half the garlic and aloe!

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,620
I can use it to make burn medicine
and antiseptic for the Sky Knight!

81
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,410
Yeah?

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,960
--What about the frogs?
--No frogs.

83
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,120
Hey, Zoro!

84
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,870
You're not doing anything. Help out.

85
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,670
You know, my swords aren't
meant to be used like this...

86
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,140
Quiet! Disobey the cook
and you'll go without dinner!

87
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,390
Eh?! We're eating rocks, too?!
Are they any good?

88
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,600
Get real. This is stone stew.

89
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,560
The heat from the cooked stone boils the stew.

90
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,780
Oh...!

91
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,280
Stew is great! You get all the
ingredients' nutrition without any waste!

92
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,930
--I see!
--Ah! We're having stew...

93
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,160
Don't open it!

94
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,610
Sanji! I'm hungry!

95
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,160
It's not even cooked yet!

96
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,740
Besides, didn't you just roast
and eat an entire skyshark?!

97
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,050
Yeah... but that was just to tide me over.

98
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,190
Geez, what kind of stomach does he have?

99
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,370
How uneconomical...

100
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,890
What're you doing, Usopp?
Dinner's almost ready.

101
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, just thought I'd start hauling
the wood for the ship's repairs...

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,430
--You planning to swim across?
--Huh? Yeah.

103
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,220
Those big sharks are in there.

104
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,570
I can fix it tomorrow! Let's get dinner, Zoro!

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
Yeesh...

106
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,300
Alright! Finished!

107
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,150
Ladies first. Got it?

108
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah.

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,580
Alright! Everyone in your seats!

110
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,970
I'll come around and serve it,
so eat before it gets cold!

111
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Alright, guys!

112
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,020
Let's begin our strategy meeting
to decide what to do tomorrow!

113
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,030
Ooh! Looks great!

114
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,600
Guys! T-Thanks.

115
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
We can do this while eating, so listen!

116
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,070
--Right!
--Right!

117
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,740
Oh! Heart-shaped carrots!

118
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,880
You're really meticulous, Sanji!

119
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,250
How is it, huh?! Do you like my love stew?!

120
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,830
Eh? What?

121
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,030
Everyone ready?

122
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,300
First, let's review Noland's picture book!

123
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,620
It was 400 years ago when Noland
first discovered the city of gold.

124
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,800
But when he returned to Jaya
years later, the gold ruins were gone!

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,450
This stew sure is good! Just like--

126
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,560
Hey! Are you listening?!

127
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm sorry, Nami-san! But he was...

128
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,870
These sky island boxed lunches are great, too!

129
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,380
Back to the story!

130
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,610
Basically, during those few years,
this island, which is part of Jaya,

131
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,950
came up into the sky!

132
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,910
You mean it rode up the Knock-Up Stream?!

133
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,430
Yeah. That's the only possibility I can think of;

134
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,100
Cricket-san said the sea floor
explodes at different places each time.

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,630
I could see an island flying
after an explosion like that!

136
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,760
But it's hard to believe that forest
on Jaya is the same as this one...

137
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,100
That's probably due to the
composition of sea and island clouds.

138
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,920
It appears the environment
around this sky island

139
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,310
allows animals and plants
to develop unusually quickly.

140
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,260
That also explains the civilization
that was swallowed up by this forest.

141
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,740
So dejected...

142
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,470
Say, the South Birds that saved
us at the lake were this big!

143
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,350
Yeah, they probably got
bigger over those 400 years.

144
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,930
But it's strange...

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,840
Why did those huge South Birds save you?

146
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,210
Yeah, I'm not really sure. But they
all called the Sky Knight "God"...

147
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,770
God?! Does that mean we
should beat up this old man?!

148
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,140
Of course not, you stupid loudmouth!

149
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,150
Alright, that's enough! Sit down, loudmouth!

150
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,110
--Yeah! Sit down!
--Who's this "loudmouth"?!
--It's you!

151
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,130
Anyways, remember what Noland's
log said about the city of gold?!

152
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,930
I know! He saw gold!

153
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,260
Obviously, you loud loudmouth!
Quit sayin' whatever comes to mind!

154
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,460
I recall there being a giant gold bell,
and that there were South Birds...

155
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,040
There was an incomprehensible
line on the last page of his log.

156
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,050
Just before he died, Noland wrote a passage

157
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,020
that said he saw gold in
the "skull's right eye"...

158
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,500
That's it! Look at this!

159
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,810
I matched the size of Robin's
Jaya map with the old Skypiea map!

160
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,590
It's just an approximation,

161
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,400
but when you put their locations
of the beach house together...

162
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,180
See! This is how Jaya looked 400 years ago!

163
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,870
--Whoa! It's a skull!
--It looks like a skull!

164
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,440
--Well?
--Awesome!

165
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,970
--Way to go, Nami-san!
--We did it!

166
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,830
Then, the "skull's right eye" is...

167
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,500
Right here!

168
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,100
Noland was referring to the
shape of the entire island.

169
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,970
But only half of it is left now,
so nobody could solve the mystery!

170
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,350
I see! So that's why...

171
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,230
Interesting...

172
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,980
--Treasure!
--Treasure!

173
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,320
So we just need to go straight to this spot!

174
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,500
We can't leave the boat, though,
so let's split into two teams tomorrow!

175
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
No doubt about it!

176
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,130
There's an enormous amount
of gold waiting for us here!

177
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Wyper...

178
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,530
Genbou! How are Kamakiri's wounds?

179
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,240
They're tending to him over there right now.

180
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,740
Are they deep?

181
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Yeah.

182
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
It's hard to believe he would be beaten...!

183
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,900
Ohm really is formidable...

184
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,710
I-I'm sorry...

185
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,840
It's...

186
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,320
It's my fault!

187
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,490
What a meal!

188
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,250
--We get gold tomorrow!
--That's right!

189
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,390
Do you think tomorrow'll be sunny, too?

190
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,450
Well, we are above the clouds...

191
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,110
It's gotten pretty late. We need
to put out any unnecessary fires.

192
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,940
They'll only reveal our location to the enemy...

193
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,790
How foolish! Did you hear that, Usopp?!
She wants to put out the fire!

194
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,170
It's not her fault.
She's lived in darkness until now.

195
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,130
She just doesn't know.

196
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,260
What do you mean?

197
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,200
You're always supposed to have a campfire!

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,300
The desire to have a campfire
when camping at night,

199
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,200
even if you're on your last legs,
is what makes one human!

200
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,480
You're the stupid ones!

201
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,410
Will you cut the crap already?!
You know how dangerous this forest is!

202
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,470
--Do not!
--There are priests! There are guerrillas!

203
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,770
And even without them, forests
at night are dangerous anyways!

204
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,560
Who knows? There could be wild
animals or monsters out there!

205
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,900
Monsters?!

206
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,000
Sky islands are scary, sky islands are scary...

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,250
Hey, Luffy!

208
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,450
Is this wood pile good enough?

209
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,710
You guys are serious about this, too?!

210
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,280
It's all right, Nami-san.
Wild animals are actually afraid of fires.

211
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,220
Behind you! There's already
something behind you!

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,530
Hey! It's saying something! C'mere, Chopper!

213
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,730
Eh?

214
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,490
"You outsiders are being too damn loud!
Get to bed, you dumbasses!"

215
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,280
--Say what?!
--Say what?!

216
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,300
I'm not the one saying it!

217
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,920
"Don't tell me you bastards are
thinkin' about trashin' our turf!"

218
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,130
No, we were brought here against our will!

219
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,920
"This is our land! Who said
you jerks could cook here?!"

220
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
Uh... Sorry!

221
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,930
"This forest is ours!
The trees, the grass, everything!"

222
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,020
I won't let you have our treasure!

223
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,780
Hey, look! Things seem even
worse now! What do we do?!

224
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,070
--Do something!
--Me?!

225
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,580
"Forget it, guys. You ain't no
match for them, even as a pack..."

226
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,920
"Girlie! You pack a mean punch! I like ya!"

227
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,220
Did we just work things out?

228
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,880
Seems that way.

229
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,640
Then let's all have a campfire together!

230
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,460
Yeah!

231
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,570
Let's get this party goin'! It's the
night festival before gold-hunting!

232
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,780
What is this?! It's delicious!

233
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,580
Did you guys make this juice?
It's delicious! More, please!

234
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,460
Yay!

235
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,340
What is this?! It's delicious!

236
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,300
Let's get the treasure!

237
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
--Gold!
--Gold!

238
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,540
They even tamed the cloud wolves...

239
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,400
No one else living on Eneru's land
would have such a wild party...

240
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,740
Oh, you're awake!
Should you be moving about?

241
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,140
I apologize for trying to help
but causing trouble instead...

242
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,520
What're you talking about? You helped a lot!

243
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,730
Thanks! I hear you saved Chopper and our ship.

244
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,960
--It was nothing...
--There's still some stew. Would you like some?

245
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,370
No, no. I thank you, but I'm
afraid I can't right now.

246
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,860
Oh! You're up, weird old man!
Thanks for your help!

247
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,680
--Let's dance!
--Let's dance, Sky Knight!

248
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,010
You're supposed to be a doctor!

249
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,020
Old man! How is Conis-chan? Is she all right?

250
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,700
Yes. She and her father
are at my house. Fear not.

251
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,980
Really?! That's great! I was so worried!

252
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,940
That's great! They're both safe!

253
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,450
Alright! Let's all toss Chopper into the air!

254
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,160
What for?!

255
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,300
I heard you talking earlier...

256
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,810
--So this island was originally known as Jaya?
--Yes.

257
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:32,650
I take it you don't know why this
place is now known as holy ground?

258
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,970
It's stuff like this that
causes distractions in battle!

259
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,990
Are you here to get in our way, Laki?!

260
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,910
I feel truly sorry for Kamakiri...

261
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,860
We're up against priests!

262
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,840
If we lack any strength in battle,
we'll never make it to God's Shrine!

263
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,270
I know apologizing won't fix everything!

264
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,880
But give that back! It's Aisa's treasure!

265
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,930
I promised I would get some Vearth for her!

266
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,100
--Shut up!
--Forgive me! Don't throw it away!

267
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,730
Kamakiri... Your wounds...

268
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,260
I can still fight.

269
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,690
You're right-- now is the time
to take down Upper Yard.

270
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,120
With Satori gone, we put up a
good fight during today's battle...

271
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,020
So let's attack again tomorrow, Wyper...

272
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:50,270
For you Blue Sea people, the ground
here must seem quite natural.

273
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,770
Yeah.

274
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,640
I see.

275
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,280
But this is something that does
not normally exist in the sky.

276
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,950
Island cloud does raise plant life,
but it does not give birth to it.

277
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,240
Neither greenery nor soil is
naturally found in the sky...

278
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,140
We call this "Vearth."

279
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,680
It is the very object of eternal
admiration for those living in the sky.

280
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,850
Once we defeat Eneru, we won't need
to revere a single bag of Vearth.

281
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,060
Right, Wyper?

282
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,980
We're going back. To the 400-year-old
homeland of the Shandians!

283
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:22,110
Even if we're far apart

284
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:28,570
I don't want you to forget

285
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:37,950
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

286
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,480
You have a friend here to share the pain

287
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:52,080
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

288
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,670
I won't let it just be a dream

289
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:05,610
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

290
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:13,310
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

291
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,510
Gold-hunting, at last!

292
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,050
I, Usopp-sama, am president of
the Lowering-the-Merry Company!

293
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,440
--Hold on, President!
--President!

294
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,100
--There is nothing I can't do!
--Just get working, President.

295
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,810
But now you're complete enemies of Eneru...

296
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,110
"Enter God Eneru!! Farewell to the Survivors"

298
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
