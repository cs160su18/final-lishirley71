00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,920
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,200
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,360
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,230
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,170
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,690
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,420
Another group of illegal entrants
has already infiltrated this land.

20
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,830
Old lady Amazon informed us

21
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,250
that it's a ship with seven
Blue Sea people on board.

22
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,070
Seven Blue Sea people...

23
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,070
Could he mean us?!

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,420
Everyone, halt!

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,930
Heso!

26
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,010
Heso!

27
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,300
Why, heso!

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,820
H-Hey, what're you guys saying?

29
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,060
So you're the seven illegal entrants
who came from the Blue Sea?!

30
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,500
I'll humbly bring Heaven's Judgment upon you!

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,740
Illegal entrants?!

32
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,930
"Already Criminals?!
Skypiea's Upholders of the Law"

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,710
Hm? Illegal entry? What's that?

34
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,600
I-Is that right?

35
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
There's no use making excuses,

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,180
since Amazon, the inspector
at Heaven's Gate,

37
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,900
sent us pictures taken by a Vision Dial.

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh, no! That can't be true!

39
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,460
Isn't that some sort of a mistake,
Captain McKinley?!

40
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,030
They're not bad people like you say.

41
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,910
What do you mean by illegal entry?

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,260
Was the entrance fee
1 billion Extol per person?

43
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,450
It's true that we didn't pay that.

44
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,410
But that old lady said we could still
pass without paying, didn't she?

45
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,420
Yes, she did!

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,800
It's no use.

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,520
Please stop making excuses and admit it.

48
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,600
However, there's no need to get panicked yet.

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,130
"Illegal entry" is only an 11th degree crime

50
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,320
according to "Heaven's Judgment."

51
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,340
Once you accept your punishment,

52
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,230
you can become legal tourists on the spot.

53
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,690
Oh, you should've said so sooner.

54
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,830
I still don't like it, but just
what is this punishment?

55
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,620
It's simple.

56
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,290
Please pay ten times the entrance fee.

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,270
If you pay right now,
we'll humbly write off your crime.

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,640
10 billion Extol per person,

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,670
in other words, 70 billion
Extol for all seven of you.

60
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,170
S-Seventy billion Extol?!

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,850
S-So how much is one Extol in Berries?

62
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,800
Berry... That's the currency
in the Blue Sea, right?

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,850
Ten thousand Extol is one Berry.

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,210
Ten thousand Extol is one Berry...

65
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,600
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand,
a hundred thousand, million...

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,980
Ahh! How much would that be?

67
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,540
Then, 70 billion Extol is 7 million Berries.

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,740
That's expensive!!

69
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,960
Do you realize how much rice
we could buy with that?! Hey!!

70
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,320
After risking our lives coming up into the sky,

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,370
why do we have to pay
that much just to enter?!

72
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,830
We can't agree to that!

73
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,940
What are you saying?

74
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,810
If that was the case,

75
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,440
all you had to do was pay
700,000 Berries when you entered.

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm telling you that's still expensive!

77
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,700
Consider this a forewarning,

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,300
but we, the White Berets, are the
unit directly under God's priests.

79
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,150
Please be careful, as arguing
raises the degree of your crime.

80
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, whatever. Let's just forget this guy.

81
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,940
More importantly, we'd better
go find Nami-san. I'm worried.

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,640
She may be crying somewhere right now.

83
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,240
Those guys earlier knew that
we came to the sky island,

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,130
which means something may be
happening to Luffy and the others, too.

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,340
I have to hurry!

86
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,110
Okay, then! As soon as
the wind direction changes,

87
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,340
we'll go out for an adventure...
no, to look for Nami!

88
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,710
H-Hey, Luffy!

89
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,260
W-Well, Usopp, what's wrong?

90
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,380
No, no... I should calm down now
and somehow talk him out of it.

91
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,720
Hmmm, you know, if Nami is just
taking a little ride around here,

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,810
she may come back soon.

93
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,810
If she does, you'll miss her.

94
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,730
Taking a little ride?

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,860
But she's taking too long for that.

96
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,050
Listen! Luffy's purpose
is to go on an adventure

97
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,860
to the so-called "place where God
lives," rather than finding Nami!

98
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,650
That's right.

99
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,520
He's planning to go there.

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,020
Right? If we go to that place,

101
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,340
we'll incur God's wrath
and really be in big trouble.

102
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,210
That girl told us that, remember?

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,620
Then, what're we gonna do?

104
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,320
We should just wait quietly for Nami
to come back without making a fuss.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,010
It's Nami we're talking about.

106
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,720
She must have a secret stash with some
small amount like 7 million Berries or so.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
Actually, there's no way she doesn't.

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,500
What have you been blabbering about?

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,650
Come to think of it,
it seems one person is missing.

110
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,730
In addition to the illegal entry,

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,730
--now there's suspicion of fleeing.
--Ahhh, h-hold on a second.

112
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,210
She'll be back soon.
Then, we'll pay the entire amount.

113
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,830
So, please relax and wait calmly.

114
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,560
Luffy, you too! If you do something
stupid and make Nami angry,

115
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,990
you know what's gonna happen,
right?! Got that?! Just wait!

116
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,890
Hmm. Just a little bit, okay?

117
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,820
Sanji, you, too.

118
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,600
Yeah.

119
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,630
Then, guys, we break up for now!

120
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,290
Now, Robin-chan, shall we
have some tea over there?

121
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,100
Sure.

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,810
Phew... I somehow managed
things for the time being.

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,770
Hey, Chopper!

124
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,520
Hm?

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,190
Do you wanna go fishing or something?

126
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,860
That sounds good! Let's do it!

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,820
Conis! Is there any place
around here we can go fishing?

128
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes, there's one nearby. I'll take you there.

129
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,110
I can't wait to ride it!

130
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,990
I hope it can be fixed.

131
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,410
Oh?

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,700
That waver looks broken.

133
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,870
If you're the ones who broke it,
that'd be a 10th degree crime,

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,000
the destruction of sky island
property by Blue Sea people.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,810
No, no! I'm sorry.
They had this one from the beginning.

136
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,380
He's right! This is mine!

137
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,080
From the beginning?

138
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,930
That's suspicious.

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,680
Wavers shouldn't exist in the Blue Sea.

140
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,590
If this was something stolen on the sky island,

141
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,310
the degree of your crime will further increase.

142
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,570
Shut up! I'll beat you up!

143
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,220
Hm?

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,640
Beat me up?

145
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,390
H-He didn't say anything!

146
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,110
Come with us, Luffy!

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,320
They're only Blue Sea people,

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,950
and yet they insult even the White Berets...

149
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,580
How foolish they are!

150
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,770
This is nice!

151
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,540
This puffy chair sure feels good.

152
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,140
What a strong pull!

153
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,630
Don't let it get away, Usopp!

154
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,930
Ahhhhh! It's trying to pull my rod away!

155
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,130
Luffy! Hurry!

156
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,890
Hm? Oh! Leave it to me!

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,620
We got it!

158
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,520
It's a big one!

159
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,650
Yahoo!

160
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,880
Ow, ow, ow... What the heck is this?

161
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,190
What a weird fish!

162
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,850
It tried to eat Conis!

163
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,540
Is this another one of the skyfish?

164
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,960
Uhm... I'm sorry.

165
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
Hm?

166
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,620
Thank you very much for saving Conis-san.

167
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,590
Father, look...

168
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,350
Hmm...

169
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,770
We're in trouble.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,440
Well, well, well...

171
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,870
This skyfish is so rare that
it's forbidden to capture it.

172
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,540
Your action was a violation
of the protection law,

173
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,820
and it's a 9th degree crime.

174
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,480
Why is it a crime?!

175
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
Zoro saved Conis!

176
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,680
Zoro, did you kill it?

177
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,940
I just smacked it.

178
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,300
I see. Then if we release it, there
shouldn't be any problem, right?

179
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,490
All right! It's very much alive!

180
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,010
Oh! It looks yummy!

181
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,140
Hey, wait Luffy! Don't eat it!

182
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,550
Ahh! Spin, spin, spin...!

183
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,170
If you eat it, you can't even give an excuse.

184
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,510
That's theft, an 8th degree crime.

185
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,150
--This is hard. It's too hard to eat!
--Ahhh! Never mind that
and come over here, Luffy!

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,610
Hey, skyfish! Go back to the sea now!

187
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,990
Don't get caught again!

188
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,060
I kept quiet and listened to all your
nonsense about crimes and such, but...

189
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,090
...if you don't cut it out, I'll...

190
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,270
Wait! Wait, Zoro! Don't be hasty!

191
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,510
This is now far beyond arguing.

192
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,610
His speech and behavior just now
are unmistakably extortion.

193
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,050
So, that's a 7th degree crime!

194
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,400
Zoro wasn't extorting! He was about to say,

195
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,670
"if you don't cut it out, I'll laugh!" That's all!

196
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,520
That's his signature gag! A gag, you know!

197
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,800
That's not right!

198
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,190
Isn't he twisting what we do
into crimes on purpose?!

199
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,370
Chopper!

200
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,680
Don't you go making things worse, too!

201
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,090
But we can't do anything like this!

202
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,820
Can't do anything? Oh, yeah!

203
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,580
All we have to do is do nothing.
Let's take a nap.

204
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,500
Now, take a nap! Take a nap now!

205
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,880
They're producing tremendous
noises at divine Angel Beach.

206
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,720
You all... if your action falls under
destruction of the environment,

207
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,630
a 6th degree crime will be added as well.

208
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,640
Hey, we can't even snore?

209
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,520
Ahhh! How annoying!

210
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,910
I'm gonna beat up this beret-wearing old guy!

211
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,770
Shall we do it?

212
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,980
W-Wait! Hey, stop it!

213
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,410
Oh, no... There's already someone there!

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,580
I wonder if they're with
those guys from earlier.

215
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,570
Please don't do anything stupid, everyone!

216
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,070
Don't be so hasty, Luffy, Zoro!

217
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,640
Listen. You know snails, right? They're...

218
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,130
Hold on a second!

219
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,840
Ah! Nami-san, you're all right!!

220
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Luffy! Don't give them any trouble!

221
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,560
But they...

222
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,120
Nami! Go ahead and pay
them the 7 million-Berry fee

223
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,280
for our illegal entry using your secret stash!

224
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,500
Good! We can still get by with a fine, then?!

225
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,780
7 million Berries, he said...?

226
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,560
What?!

227
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,920
That's too expensive!!

228
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,990
Oh, shoot!

229
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,170
Because they demanded such an
unreasonably high fee, I unintentionally...

230
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,210
Hey...

231
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,670
C-Captain!!

232
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,670
Hey, mister, thanks for letting
me use your waver. It was fun.

233
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,540
No, no. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,140
More importantly, you all are in big trouble!

235
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,460
--Captain! Please hang in there!
--Everyone, let's get out of here!

236
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,200
--Your wound isn't deep!
--How did this happen?! Captain!!
--Why? I thought you started a fight.

237
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,600
It's dangerous to have anything to
do with this God thing. Seriously!

238
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,190
By the way, what crime would that be?

239
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,140
I think it's probably a 5th degree
crime for obstructing official duties.

240
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,360
Good! That's still only a 5th degree crime!

241
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,610
That's not good!

242
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,340
When it's determined
to be a 5th degree crime,

243
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,620
in the name of God Eneru,
you'll be banished to the clouds.

244
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,190
Banished to the clouds?

245
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,640
What's that? Being banished
to the clouds sounds kinda nice.

246
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,410
No, it doesn't! It's the death penalty!

247
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,880
D-Death penalty?!

248
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,100
He's completely out of it.

249
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,000
But the death penalty in God's Land?

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
That's harsh.

251
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,080
But it's the truth. It really exists!

252
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,960
It's a punishment where you,
together with your ship,

253
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,380
are put on a cloud that
you can't escape from,

254
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,130
and you keep wandering
until you become bones.

255
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,000
It's the death penalty!

256
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,530
I see.

257
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,120
That's why that ship fell from the sky.

258
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,140
What?! What're you talking about, Robin?

259
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,020
Remember that galleon that fell from the sky?

260
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,960
The St. Briss, was it?

261
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,100
They might have received that
punishment 200 years ago.

262
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,580
Hey, you!!

263
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,110
Do you realize what you've
done to the Captain?!

264
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,100
What did you say?

265
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,600
Ahh! Sanji-kun, hold on!

266
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,820
Why, sure, Nami-san!

267
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,690
Don't be upset like that. That was by chance.

268
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,920
By chance?!

269
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,970
W-Well, how should I put it, I unintentionally...

270
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,190
Unintentionally?!

271
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,260
Uhm, you know... it was like an accident.

272
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,130
An accident?! An accident, you say?!

273
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,090
That's right! It was an accident!

274
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,380
An accident!

275
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,610
'Cause it's hard to control
and ride a waver, right?!

276
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,050
On top of that, I rode it today for the first time,

277
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,440
so I made a little mistake
while turning the handles.

278
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,630
I'm clumsy, aren't I?

279
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,800
I guess beginners shouldn't push
too hard, after all, should they?

280
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,520
She wasn't having troubles riding it,

281
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,200
she looked like she was having lots of fun!

282
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,280
Hey, Luffy!

283
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,740
--Oh, no, Luffy!
--Nami's trying to fool them into
thinking that it was an accident.

284
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,780
--That's impossible!
--Don't say anything unnecessary.

285
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,700
Oh, really?

286
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,060
Uhm, I'm sorry,

287
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,990
but I thought it'd be better
to treat Captain McKinley first.

288
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,810
Th-That's right!!

290
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,180
Captain McKinley!!

291
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,890
Then, let's carry him over to my house.

292
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,020
We appreciate your assistance!

293
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,010
Heso!

294
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,930
All seven of you, don't go
anywhere! Understood?!

295
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,230
Captain!

296
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,270
They're crawling again?

297
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,180
Why can't they just carry him normally?

298
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,040
I know you're not bad people.

299
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,810
So, please use this chance
to get away from here!

300
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,910
H-Hey!

301
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,770
Let's do as she said.

302
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,920
I saw it with my own eyes.
An island with these scary guys on it!

303
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,100
So you did go to the place they
call forbidden sacred ground.

304
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,150
"The place you're never to step foot in."

305
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,470
"Scary guys"...

306
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,710
Ah! Don't listen! Don't look! Don't talk!

307
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,660
God... guerrilla...

308
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,060
That place is no good for sure!

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,180
In any case, we're leaving! We're leaving!

310
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,580
Ahh... It's heartbreaking to
be apart from Conis-chan,

311
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,360
but if that's what Nami-san says...

312
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,270
If we stick around, those two
may also get in trouble.

313
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,480
That's right!

314
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,540
Those guys will just make them
out to be our accomplices!

315
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,540
So, if we make it so that
we run away on our own,

316
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,940
it shouldn't cause any trouble for them.

317
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,450
Right?! Okay, that settles it! Let's go!

318
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,270
What're you doing, Luffy?!

319
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,930
Why are we running away?

320
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,380
Because we'll be in big trouble!

321
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,430
We're always in big trouble.

322
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,790
Like I said, it's not just us,

323
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,350
but those two may get
arrested, too, you know!

324
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,760
Those two have done nothing wrong.

325
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,970
The one who arrests them is wrong.

326
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,430
I know that's true, but...

327
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,730
Please... hurry up...

328
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,980
There's no place for them to escape to.

329
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,960
How long will you two be
arguing? Come up already!

330
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,230
How many times do I have to tell you?!

331
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,900
If we stay here, we'll be in big trouble,
and so will those two!

332
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,790
Either way, we're in big trouble.

333
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,780
Please run!

334
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,890
Hurry!

335
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,430
Oh, darn!

336
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,220
You shouldn't, Miss.

337
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,320
If you say something
that defends criminals,

338
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,510
you two are also going to pay.

339
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,130
As you know, those people are felons

340
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,640
who should be sentenced to be
banished to the clouds as punishment

341
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,130
for their 5th degree crime, caused by
all their abusive language towards us

342
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,030
along with their obstruction
of our official duties.

343
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,790
Like I said, it was an accident!
C'mon, already!

344
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,410
Arrest them!

345
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,820
Please get out of here!
They're beyond your power!

346
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,460
Fire! Milky arrows!

347
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,290
Arrows?!

348
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,850
You go ahead, Nami!

349
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,930
Okay!

350
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,520
What're these?!

351
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,050
Clouds?!

352
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,180
Go, White Berets!

353
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,000
What?! What's going on?!

354
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
Let's go!

355
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,000
It's so fluffy that it's hard to run!

356
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,550
Watch out!

357
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,560
How foolish... to think you
could get away from us!

358
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,310
I see... Those're the skating type.

359
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,400
That's neat!

360
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,800
You guys have fun stuff!

361
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,710
What?!

362
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,210
What is he?!

363
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,640
What?! His arm... His arm stretched!

364
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Oh, my...

365
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,610
Gum-Gum...

366
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,680
Can't be...! Devil Fruit?!

367
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,390
...Fireworks!!

368
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,640
By the way, Nami!

369
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,370
What's our financial situation?

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,310
We have 50,000 Berries left.

371
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,980
50,000? We're that poor?

372
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,570
Normally, that'll last a day or two at most.

373
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,770
Why are we so poor?

374
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,240
As your captain, I gotta say this.

375
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,650
You should think more about
how you use money and...

376
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,210
It's because you eat so much!!

377
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,080
Alright!

378
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
In any case, the "Formation B"
that I instructed them to use

379
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,500
during the fight was successful!

380
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Really?!

381
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,940
They defeated...

382
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,080
...the White Berets!

383
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,240
Normally, up here, the athletic abilities
of Blue Sea people decrease.

384
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,410
You fools!

385
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,470
You can't go back now!

386
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,500
Hm?

387
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,400
You should've just behaved
and done what I told you to...

388
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:42,360
We, the White Berets, are the gentlest
upholders of the law in God's Land.

389
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,030
However, they are not as nice as we are!

390
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,700
You are now 2nd degree criminals!

391
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,180
No matter if you cry or scream...

392
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,060
...you'll be judged...

393
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,950
...by the priests of Upper Yard!!

394
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,360
Heso!!

395
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,730
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

396
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:28,370
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

397
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:43,680
There are days where I almost lose to myself

398
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:50,680
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

399
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,120
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

400
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:09,120
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

401
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:17,430
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

402
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,280
This unique moment...

403
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,800
We were tricked!

404
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,620
What's the fuss? We're used to being pursued.

405
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,470
Alright, then! Get ready for an adventure!

406
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,430
He's definitely planning to go there!

407
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,500
Hey, something's wrong with the ship!

408
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,060
It seems there's nothing we can do.
It's already started.

409
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,820
Heaven's Judgment, huh?

410
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

411
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,390
"Is Escape Possible?!
God's Challenge is Set in Motion!"

412
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
