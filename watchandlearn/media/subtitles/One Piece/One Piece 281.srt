2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,300
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,310
attained everything this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,020
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,810
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,660
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,570
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,120
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,940
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,440
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,690
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,460
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,580
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,210
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,590
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,010
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,810
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,320
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,580
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,970
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,870
We are!

24
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,520
Robin!

25
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,980
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

26
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,240
The drawbridge is coming down!

27
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,390
Robin...

28
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,670
It must've been really hard.

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,700
But you're not alone anymore.

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,600
You've got us.

31
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,830
Nami would never kill Usopp!

32
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,810
We're friends!

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,780
Who're friends, Luffy?

34
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,670
Nami!

35
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,740
Why are you here?

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,860
What're you talking about?
You're our friend! We came to get you!

37
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,170
You're a big problem.

38
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,950
Nami?

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,220
Friends? Don't make me laugh!

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,000
You're just a pathetic bunch of
people cooperating with each other.

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,940
"A Bond of Friendship Woven
by Tears! Nami's World Map"

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,720
You really know how to trash a place.

43
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,830
What's wrong, Nami?

44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,450
Nothing. I'm just here to rest a little.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Breaking glass and furniture
just to rest is a bit much.

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,950
You have that treasure map open,
even though nothing's wrong?

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,630
Something happened to make me mad, that's all!

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,850
Them, huh? Who are they?

49
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,210
You met them?!

50
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,780
Yeah. Some Captain Something-or-Other.

51
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,550
He seemed kind of liar-ish, though.

52
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,700
I hear you smiled happily when
you were traveling with them.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,250
Even though I haven't
seen you like that in years.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,390
Talk to me! Who are those guys?

55
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,620
We agreed you could tell
me anything, remember?

56
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,850
I had planned to forget about them...

57
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,010
I thought I had erased them from my mind.

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,570
Who do you take your friends for?!

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,090
I honestly felt like always being
with them, if it were possible.

60
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,270
Now I see...

61
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,200
Yeah, that'd hit you hard.

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,030
To think that someone
really showed up for her...

63
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,200
Friends, huh?

64
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,760
The most painful word for her...

65
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,180
What's wrong, girlie?

66
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,510
Do you want me to return
the village that badly?

67
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,400
Then how's this? Let's make an agreement.

68
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,820
Agreement?

69
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,030
That's right.

70
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,030
Gather up 100 million Berries and bring it here.

71
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,010
Do so and I'll let the village
go and give you freedom.

72
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,230
Honest?!

73
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,200
Honest!

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,630
I'd die before I'd break an
agreement concerning money.

75
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,200
It doesn't matter how many years
it takes. I'll honor our agreement.

76
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,530
I absolutely will save up 100 million Berries!

77
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,370
Arlong!

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,110
Oh? What's wrong, skilled surveyor
of ours? Why the angry look?

79
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,970
The Navy men you have under
your control stole all my money!

80
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,240
What happened to dying before
breaking promises about money?!

81
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,370
Why?!

82
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,700
When did I break our promise?

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,140
Don't play dumb! You teamed
up with the Navy to--!

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,960
When did I break our promise? Let's hear it!

85
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,020
Damn you... Damn you! Damn you!

86
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,610
I see! So your money's been stolen?
How unfortunate.

87
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,940
But an agreement is an agreement.

88
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,990
If you can't gather up
100 million Berries for me to see,

89
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,950
I'm afraid I can't give you the village back.

90
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,430
Scum!

91
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,950
It's only 100 million Berries!
Just start saving up again!

92
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,090
Or are you gonna run out on me?

93
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,670
But if you do run away, I'll kill
everyone in Cocoyashi Village.

94
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,810
Nami...

95
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,610
We pretended we didn't know.

96
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,690
Because our hopes would keep you
from running away from Arlong

97
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,160
if you ever decided to.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
No more of this! Take up
your weapons! Let's fight!

99
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,040
Eight years ago, we swore
not to throw away our lives!

100
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,570
No matter how painful and insulting
it was to be ruled by them,

101
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,070
we swore to fight the patient fight
as long as Nami was cheerful!

102
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,750
But this is their answer!

103
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,710
Now that our village's chance for
freedom is gone, we have no hope!

104
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,710
More than that,

105
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,630
we must make those fishmen pay
for toying with that girl's kindness!

106
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,430
Any objections?!

107
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,580
Of course not! Let's go!

108
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,080
Wait, everyone!

109
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,630
Nami!

110
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,480
Just a little more! Just wait a
little more! I'll work hard again!

111
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,310
I'll save up the money again!

112
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,440
It'll be easy this time!

113
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,730
I'm used to it! I'll be fine!
There's no need to worry at all!

114
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,130
This is nothing compared to back then!

115
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,380
Please, no more dying!

116
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,580
Everyone! I'm fine! I'm just fine!

117
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,900
You can stop now...

118
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,810
Even you know there's no point now...

119
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,140
You fought very well, carrying our
lives on your back all this time...

120
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,790
Joining them must've been
even more painful for you

121
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,150
than being cut through the heart...

122
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,550
You fought very well.

123
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,760
Gen-san...

124
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,540
Leave the village now.

125
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,990
Gen-san?!

126
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,810
Do it, Nami.

127
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,840
W-What?!

128
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,770
Nacchan...

129
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,700
Nami...

130
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,040
You're crafty, and you have a dream.

131
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,820
Nojiko! Everyone!

132
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,640
I won't let you go!

133
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,180
Stop it, everyone! I don't want to
see anyone else get hurt by them!

134
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,000
You'll die, you know!

135
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,270
We know.

136
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,590
It's no use! We've made up our minds!

137
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,870
Get out of our way, Nami!

138
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,860
Let's go, everyone!

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,110
Even if we can't win,
let's show 'em what we're made of!

140
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,390
Arlong! Arlong!

141
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,720
Arlong! Arlong!

142
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,580
Arlong!

143
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,530
Luffy...

144
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,420
What do you want?!
You don't even know anything!

145
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,220
You don't even know what's happened
on this island the past eight years!

146
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,830
Yeah. I don't know.

147
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,680
This has nothing to do with you!

148
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,120
I told you, leave the damn island already!

149
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,010
Yeah. You told me.

150
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,860
Leave! I don't need you!

151
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,240
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

152
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,780
Leave! Leave! Leave!

153
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,530
Leave!

154
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,560
Luffy...

155
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,350
Help me...

156
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,770
Of course I will!

157
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,850
Don't touch my treasure!

158
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,310
Luffy...

159
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,790
Let's go.

160
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,540
Yeah!

161
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,250
What the...?!

162
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,050
Which one of you is Arlong?!

163
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
You can no longer escape.

164
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,620
This is the top floor of Arlong Park.

165
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,370
What's this room?

166
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,490
Full of papers...

167
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,020
These're not just ordinary papers.

168
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,970
This room is where I make that
woman draw sea charts. It's...

169
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,930
...the survey room!

170
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,200
Nami's room...

171
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,100
These're all sea charts that Nami drew.

172
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,430
She's going to continue drawing
sea charts! For my ambition!

173
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,110
And once her charts give me full
knowledge of all the world's seas...

174
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,030
...we fishmen will be invincible,
and the world will become our empire!

175
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,000
Our first stepping stone is
this island... and the East Blue!

176
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,390
Could you use the girl as efficiently as that?!

177
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,300
"Use"?!

178
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,770
What's that?!

179
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,890
A desk...

180
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,260
What do you think you're doing?!

181
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,990
What in the...?! There's an
awful lot of stuff flying!

182
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,290
Stop that!

183
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,420
The charts!

184
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,760
M-My charts!

185
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,780
This... is a pretty intense fight!

186
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,250
Yeah! Looks like a fight to the death!

187
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,190
Definitely!

188
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
Thank you...

189
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,800
You've gone too far, you damn rubber man!

190
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:37,620
"Fishmen are great" and "sea charts" this,
"circumstances" that...

191
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,490
I don't know much about any of that stuff...

192
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,830
But I finally figured out how to save her!

193
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,670
She can't go because this room is here!

194
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,410
If she doesn't want to be here,
then I'll just destroy it all!

195
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,290
Gum-Gum...

196
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,390
...Battle-Axe!

197
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,870
Impossible! It's gonna collapse!

198
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,490
This is dangerous! Everyone, get away!

199
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,330
Big Sis Nami! Hurry!

200
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,500
But Luffy's still inside!

201
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
--Big Sis!
--Luffy! Luffy's still...!

202
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,590
Luffy!

203
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,830
Luffy...

204
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,140
Which one won?!

205
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,330
Given all this debris... Don't tell me it was--!

206
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,110
Luffy...

207
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,490
Luffy!

208
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,070
Big Bro!

209
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,500
Is he okay?!

210
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,430
Nami!

211
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,690
You're my friend!

212
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,530
Yeah!

213
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,370
My friends helped me.

214
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,540
This time, I'll fight for one of my friends, too.

215
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,340
So, Robin, have faith in us... in Luffy!

216
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,590
He'll respond to your feelings without fail.

217
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,680
Hey, pirates! What're you
guys wasting time for?!

218
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,520
Huh? What's the meaning of that smile?

219
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,150
Here we go!

220
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,080
I knew it!

221
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Nooo!

222
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,200
"Straw Hat Theater"

"Luffizaki"

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh, dear! I'm out of soy sauce!

229
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,280
And here I was gonna make
soy sauce meat steak,

230
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,870
meat salad and meat miso soup today...!

Pardon me, I'm coming in, okay?

233
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Hey, Zoroyama-san, I'm out of soy sauce.

234
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,760
Now, be a dearie and spare
me some, would you? Whoa!

235
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,460
That gave me a start!
Hey, are you in the middle of training?

236
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,510
Oh, dearie me, if it isn't Luffizaki-san.

237
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,140
My, no, I'm not training.
We're having sashimi today...

238
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,800
...so I was just cutting some raw fish.

239
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
My, my, seems like you cut the whole kitchen.

240
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,810
Oh, that's right, soy sauce!

241
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,430
We're... all out, too.

242
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,050
Oh, my, your bottle's been cut in two.

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,440
Oh, my word... My word...!
This ham is the bee's knees!

246
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
This one with the cheese wrapped
in ham is simply to die for!

247
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,240

Why?! Come now,
Luffizaki-san does this all the time!

She's always causing us trouble, too!

252
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,500
Can it! Now bring me some
sweet jam for this ham!

253
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,630
Make it sweet and tasty!

We're all ladies here.

--Enough of that, you two!
--Oh, no, Mellorine...

258
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh, good! It's the middle-aged woman
of once-a-month justice, Namijima-san!

259
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,560
She forgets her own faults and tells off

the middle-aged woman pirate gang
once a month for some reason!

261

Hey, hey, hey, hey...!

262
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,490
Hey, hey, Luffizaki-san!
Have I got news for you!

263
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,370
The supermarket in front of the train
station has some super bargains!

264
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,780
The meat is freakin' cheap, too!

265
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,910
Meat is?! Usokawa-san,
you aren't fooling me, are you?!

266
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,450
Yeah, I was lying. I brought you the circular.

267

"Circular"

268
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,670
--Oh, phooey!
--But forget that, I have terrible news!

269
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,000
Chopamori-san and Sanjida-san
were caught at the supermarket.

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,130
--Ah, I need some tea!
--Oh, dear! Could it be that
Namijima-san is at it again?

271
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,550
Hey, hey, hey...!

272
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,850
Robino-san! Let us hide here!
Namijima-san's gonna kill us!

273
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,390
Oh, my, good timing.

274
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,930
I've been warning you guys
about sorting your trash.

275
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,100
Please stop insisting that
everything is burnable trash.

276
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,190
What's with that nonsense?!
It's burnable if there's enough spirit!

277
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,230
Why, good point, Luffizaki-san! She's right!

278
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,400
It's a matter of spirit... The incinerator's.

279
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,810
What silly nonsense.

280
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,820
Oh? Pickled vegetables?!

281
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,870
Your pickled vegetables are
the best, Robino-san! I love them!

282
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,790
Oh, my! Then let's take a break and have
this barley tea I found in the fridge!

283
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,780
Click.

284
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,420
Hello?

285
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,450
Why, yes, they're here. Sure.

286
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,170
Oh, Robino-san? Who just called?

287
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,520
Namijima-san.

288
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,640
So... mind telling me what
happened to this month's rent?

289
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
Big landowner, Namijima-san...

290
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,900
Could you be a dearie and wait
until tomorrow's town raffle event?

291
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,400
No! I'm gonna go to your employers
and collect the money directly from them.

292
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,450
No, Namijima-san! Not that!

293
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,820
Tomorrow is gonna mark the end of our lives!

294
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,870
--Fine by me.
--What?!

295
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,580
Even if they're all middle-aged women,

296
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,200
the strongest one is Namijima-san!

297
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,920
Robin has been alone all this time...
just like I used to be.

298
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,430
But our paths crossed and we became friends.

299
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,060
You're not alone anymore, Robin-chan.

300
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,350
He's right. You've got Luffy and all of us!

301
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,270
We're not gonna let
anyone sacrifice themselves.

302
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,270
Just wait, Robin!

303
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,480
We'll rescue you for sure!

304
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!
