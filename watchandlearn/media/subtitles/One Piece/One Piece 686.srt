Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,620
Keep on advancing

kawaru koto no nai kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" terashidasu

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,660
The unchanging bond will light up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070
Freedom is our only compass, We are best friends

11

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580
We will keep making our own route

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed everyday, Go east, Go west!

tsugitsugi mitsukaru yaritai koto subete kuria shite

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,990
We can't wait until the morning (I can't wait)

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,990

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
go-in Go

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,570

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

kasaneawase gutto kitara sore ga torejaa sa

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,150
Keep on advancing

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,150

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,260
The unchanging bond will light up the "end of the dream"

35
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:37,260
kawaru koto no nai kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" terashidasu

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,930
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,460
We are the one! Go ahead!

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480
Everytime we overcome something,

43
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480
norikoeru tabi

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,650

asu mo asatte mo

47
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,060
Tomorrow and the day after,

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,760
there will be a chain of burning, intense excitement!

49
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,760
atsuku hageshii wakuwaku no rensa daze!

52

55
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310
and go wherever you want to go - that's the adventure

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,010
Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,040
iku ze Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" tsukamitoru

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,580
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,170
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

75
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,580
with Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,120
They freed the toys who had been forced to
labor as slaves

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,010
but Doflamingo trapped everybody in the country in the Birdcage.

78
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,830
Now, let's bring an end to everything.

79
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,170
I-It's started...!

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll pay 100 million berries for each star rating!

81
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,110
And put prices on the heads of Luffy and 11 others.

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,620
Wait, Hajrudin! If you kill Straw Hat,
you'll get a lot of money!

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,240
That's just a pittance!
I almost had my pride stolen

84
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,910
but was saved by God Usopp!

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,250
I can truly win my pride back,
only by repaying my debt!

86
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,790
--I will take down Doflamingo!
--No, I will!

87
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,950
--No, it's me!
--No, me!

88
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,740
I said "Go away"!

89
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,610
I will kick Mingo's ass!

90
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,740
It's massive! We're finished!

91
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,730
We have nowhere to run!

92
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,140
Gum-Gum...

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,830
...Grizzly Magnum!

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,610
What?! That's the stone man?!

95
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,470
This is the first time we've seen him
in a human-like figure!

96
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,670
I'll see you later!

97
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,690
Yeah, leave it up to me!

98
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,180
Our captain has no business with
a worthless rock like you!

99
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm all you've got. Live with it!

100
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,250
You soprano-voiced dumb-ass!

101
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,990
"A Shocking Confession!
Law's Soulful Vow!"

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,310
Pica-sama stopped moving
after his head fell off!

103
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,000
What happened?!

104
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,310
Hey! The monster stopped moving! Is he dead?!

105
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,190
No, I don't think so.

106
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,680
But, whatever happened to him,
if he's not gonna throw those annoying punches,

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,350
now is the chance!

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,520
I will bring down Doflamingo!

109
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,190
--It's me!
--No, me!

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,430
Those jerks are coming again!

111
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,550
Stop them!
Don't let them get to the Palace!

112
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,640
Bring out more worthwhile guys to fight!

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,590
I-It's impossible.

114
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,440
We can't stop the group of fighters from the Colosseum.

115
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,320
Oh! How vigorous they are!

116
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,350
I can't believe they still wanna mess with the Young Master!

117
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,310
So reckless-in!

118
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,940
That's right! Groups of Navy soldiers led by

119
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,120
Fujitora are coming together in front of the Palace!

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,110
"G"roups of Navy soldiers! There's the "G"!

121
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,840
Bastille's unit will join us soon.

122
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,540
Half of all Navy soldiers are already
in front of the Palace!

123
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,660
I knew it was Straw Hat and the others
that stopped Pica-sama.

124
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,150
There are four different groups or individuals
approaching the Palace.

125
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,670
First, the group of tough men from around the New World,

126
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,220
who fought in the Colosseum.

127
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,360
Second, the former commander of the King Riku Army and...

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,680
...the strongest man in the history of the Colosseum - Kyros.

129
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,630
Just give yourself up, Kyros!

130
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,110
It's only a matter of time

131
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,260
before we're all dead
if we don't catch you all!

132
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,080
We need you 12 criminals to
sacrifice yourselves!

133
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,200
And, third, No.2 of the Straw Hats - Pirate Hunter Zoro!

134
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,980
Fourth, Straw Hat Luffy and the traitor - Law!

135
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,340
That's it! Keep going, Moocy!

136
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,950
--Yeah! Go, bull!
--Bull!

137
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,860
Guys, how much longer are you gonna stay on?!

138
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,030
Just get off!

139
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,150
I know you're kidding, Straw Hat-san!

140
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,160
I don't see Señor anywhere.

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,810
He was with us just a while ago.

142
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,410
I think he went to look for that pervert-in!

143
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,290
Pervert?

144
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,940
Alright, here I am!

145
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,690
Per...

146
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,690
...vert!

147
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,580
SMILE factory! Ow!

148
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,560
Now, break open, door to the factory!

149
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,870
Radical Bea...

150
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,440
I know that crappy attack won't even harm the factory but...

151
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,510
...I just came to finish up my business with you.

152
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,120
I still have to fight an enemy?!

153
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,810
That's what men do, boy.

154
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,060
Oh! Señor!

155
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,030
Please, Kyros!
Come on out and surrender yourself!

156
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,800
We're gonna come get you if you don't!

157
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,020
We're not doing this for money!

158
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,480
If nothing is done, we all have to kill each other until no one's left!

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,890
We have no choice!

160
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,110
We just wanna bring an end to this nightmare
as soon as possible!

161
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,340
You want to bring an end to this fight!

162
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,020
I don't blame you for your decision but...

163
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,570
...that means I need to get going even faster!

164
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,890
--Shoot!
--Don't let him get away!

165
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,370
There's something that I need to do, too!

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,290
You're doing great, Moocy! You're amazing!

167
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,970
We'll get to Mingo before anyone else like this!

168
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,140
Wait for me, Mingo!
I'm not gonna let them do it!

169
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm gonna beat the hell out of you!

170
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,110
What are you guys looking at?

171
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Straw Hat-san, your friend...

172
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,020
He stayed all by himself to
fight such a monster...

173
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,310
How manly!

174
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,100
Oh, you mean Zoro?

175
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,820
He'll be alright! He's not gonna lose!

176
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,450
What?!

177
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm gonna kill you, you bastard!

178
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,370
Boy, your voice is so squeaky and annoying.

179
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,320
It makes my ears tickle.

180
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,760
Damn you!

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,250
Go to hell!

182
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,780
What are you doing, soprano-voiced old man?

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,510
He made a vow! He'll never be defeated!

184
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,530
At any cost!

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,150
Hey, Straw Hat-ya.

186
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,300
I know the only way for us to survive now is to kill him.

187
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,730
I've made up my mind, too.

188
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,860
The plan that I suggested to you guys was

189
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,750
to take down Doflamingo indirectly.

190
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,320
But, to be honest, I...

191
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,410
...want to hurt him directly, too!

192
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,660
I was beaten earlier but I won't be this time!

193
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,020
13 years ago, there was a person I adored

194
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,800
and Doflamingo killed him!

195
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,610
His name is Corazon.

196
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,800
The former top executive of
the Doflamingo Family!

197
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,510
What?! Was he a member of his clan?

198
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,030
Yes, he was.
He also saved my life and was...

199
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,070
...Doflamingo's...

200
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,580
...biological young brother!

201
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,060
Luffy-senpai!

202
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,480
Luffy-senpai!

203
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,240
Luffy-senpai! Where are you?

204
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,250
Huh? Luffy-senpai's not here!

205
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,500
Of course, he's not.

206
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,350
What do you mean "Of course"?!

207
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,820
Luffy wouldn't stay in the same place
even for five minutes.

208
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,410
Oh! Freedom! Whew!

209
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,930
That's how the King of the Pirates should be!

210
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,100
What is that stone monster?!
King Riku-sama!

211
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,450
Why is the Royal Palace up there?!

212
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,300
I found it!

213
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,780
Oh! Viola-san!

214
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,010
Viola.

215
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,800
I found it, Father-sama!

216
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,690
The key to Trafalgar Law's handcuffs!

217
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,240
I finally found it with my Clairvoyance!

218
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,780
I have to deliver it to them somehow!

219
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,030
Wait, Viola!

220
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,450
Why are they so important to you?!
They're pirates!

221
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,620
Yes, they're unlawful men - who will break
this country's deceptive peace!

222
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,190
Father-sama, I decided to trust them,
the Straw Hat Pirates!

223
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,070
The World Government gave him the title of the Warlord

224
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,010
and that pirate Doflamingo reigned this country with terror,

225
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,480
causing us so much pain!

226
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,710
I don't want the help of the Navy, that was supposed to be

227
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,830
supporting justice, or the Government after all these years!

228
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,250
They can't hear them!

229
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,490
The voices of the people who fell victim because of them!

230
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,410
The angry voices of this country!

231
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,130
People in authority often only hear
what they want to!

232
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,250
At least, the words of Straw Hat and the others are humane

233
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,260
and they take actions
out of the goodness of their hearts!

234
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,920
I promise I'll kick Doflamingo's ass for you!

235
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,030
So stay with my friends!

236
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,520
Take a good look at this country!

237
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,180
If I stop now, what's gonna happen to it?!

238
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,130
King Riku-sama! King Riku-sama!

239
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,640
Take a look at him!

240
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,420
You're the Five-star man, aren't you?!

241
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,570
That's right!

242
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,100
His name is Usoland aka God Usopp!

243
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,430
This man risked his life

244
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,950
and broke the spell of toys
that had been

245
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,180
overshadowing this country for a decade!

246
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,080
He's our hero!

247
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:38,730
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

248
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,460
Usoland! Usoland!

249
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,590
His bravery moved us to tears!

250
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,430
Really, really, really,

251
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,140
we were so touched by it!

252
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,510
He's a superhero!

253
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,990
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

254
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,820
And Luffyland is the superhero's captain!

255
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
King Riku-sama!

256
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,830
The Straw Hats aka Usolanders are Dressrosa's hope!

257
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,700
Even though they're pirates,
we're gonna trust them to the end!

258
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,300
This is great!

259
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,440
It's the Straw Hats' unforgettable moving scene!

260
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,010
How lucky I am to be here!

261
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,950
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

262
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,650
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

263
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,030
Look, Viola-san,
can I go deliver the key to Lucy?!

264
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,720
Rebecca!

265
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,630
I can't just stay here and wait!
Let me do it!

266
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,330
Rebecca...

267
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,880
Alright, let's do it!
Let's go see Luffy-senpai!

268
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm coming with you, of course! Count on me!

269
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,710
Rebecca! You're a criminal in Doflamingo's game!
If you go down to the town,

270
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,200
--they won't leave you alone!
--I'm gonna be okay!

271
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,820
All right. Just be careful.

272
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,240
Uh-huh!

273
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,860
--Cub-san!
--Yeah!

274
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,750
Everybody!

275
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,200
You guys?!

276
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,390
If you are planning on going,
let's use the rooftops!

277
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,910
Cub-san and I will go along with you!
So don't worry!

278
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,080
--Rooftops?!
--Yes!

279
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,100
Inhel, can I leave the factory in your hands?

280
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,250
No problem!

281
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,890
According to the scouting unit,
Fraland is fighting Señor Pink now!

282
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,970
Along with Fraland, we Tontattas will all work together

283
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,960
to take back Princess Mancherie and our people!

284
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,100
Uh-huh!

285
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,900
I'll see you guys later!

286
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,300
Everybody! We don't have that much time!

287
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,630
I'll see you all again here on the King's Plateau!

288
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,910
Let's go now!

289
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,890
Yeah!

290
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,630
Straw Hat Luffy... What a strange man.

291
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,470
Even in this desperate situation,

292
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,360
everyone finds hope in the Straw Hats without them realizing.

293
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,330
Pirates, huh?

294
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,080
--Straw Hat-san, we're almost at the first level!
--There are so many enemies there!

295
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,280
--That's…
--Something's coming this way!

296
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,850
Yeah! We're the first to arrive!
No one's here yet!

297
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,720
Well done, Moocy!

298
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,020
--It's Straw Hat Luffy!
--Shoot! Shoot!

299
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,160
Gum-Gum...

300
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,930
...Fire Salute!

301
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,580
All right! Keep up the pace, Moocy!

302
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,240
Let's go!

303
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,820
Luffy and the others keep making smooth progress!

304
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,020
But the Navy led by Fujitora starts chasing,

305
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,310
and when they close in on Luffy and the others,

306
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,930
one man stands in the Navy's way on his own!

307
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,180
The strongest forces of the Revolutionary Army
and the Navy finally face off!

308
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,170
"A Big Collision! Chief of Staff - Sabo vs. Admiral Fujitora!”

310
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
