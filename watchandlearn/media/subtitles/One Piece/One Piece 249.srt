2
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,330
Have a nice flight off the island!

3
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,760
You bastard!

4
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,820
Ow...

5
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,870
Man, that was rough.

6
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,380
Dammit! That damn leopard jerk!
Now I'm really pissed!

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,340
I'll pay him back two times over.

8
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,110
Dammit!

9
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,740
It's all right! Now let's move forward

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,700
with the sun always in our hearts

11
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,040
As power passes through our clasped hands

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,710
let's grab hold of our wishes

13
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:04,720
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,110
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

15
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:18,990
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

16
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,120
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,500
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,460
but what you cherish most will be right there

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,510
And if you get into a jam

20
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,510
I'll always be there to protect you

21
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,680
It's all right! Now let's move forward

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,270
with the sun always in our hearts

23
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,230
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

24
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,570
and gaze at the light beyond

25
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,490
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

26
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,740
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

27
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,700
So let's grab hold of our wishes

28
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,500
under the same flag-- together, we're one

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,130
One Piece

30
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:30,100
"Spandam's Scheme!
The Day the Sea Train Shook"

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,770
I see...

32
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,570
So this filthy warehouse used to be

33
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,320
Tom's Workers shipbuilding
company's main office, huh?

34
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,740
A shipbuilding company?

35
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,420
Tom, Iceberg, and Cutty Flam...

36
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,630
So this is a place that holds memories

37
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,920
of the three of you devoting
yourselves to building ships, huh?

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,800
To think that you call it a secret base...

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,390
That's quite adorable.

40
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,060
Shut up!

41
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,350
Get out of this place already!

42
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,770
Not until we get what we want,
shipwright Cutty Flam.

43
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,820
The blueprints are not here!

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,240
Well... That's not surprising.

45
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,620
--Hey!
--Kalifa!

46
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,460
Ow...!

47
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,380
Wh-Wh-What do I do?!

48
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,260
You son of a bitch!

49
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,600
You don't have to tell us right away.

50
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,310
We've got a trump card.

51
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,270
Although this is from eight years ago,

52
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,570
I heard that you committed a crime...

53
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,030
...just like Tom did.

54
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,030
That's a load of crap! Tom-san wasn't a criminal!

55
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,700
Don't talk like you know everything! You brat!

56
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,670
Tom-san...!

57
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,130
Stay back!

58
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,840
Don't make a fuss.

59
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,310
You're a criminal. You should
know what will happen to you.

60
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,350
Franky... Don't interfere
in what I'm about to do...

61
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,770
No matter what.

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
You don't know anything...

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,150
Anything about Tom-san...

64
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,660
Anything about Water Seven!

65
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,030
"Water Seven, 8 years ago"

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,340
The Judicial Ship is coming in three days?

67
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,920
They're finally having Tom's trial, huh?

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,630
I wonder what'll happen?

69
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,130
He should be okay.

70
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,430
Yeah.

71
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,350
He did fulfill his promise.

72
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,890
Yeah.

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Carry the received lumber into the dock!

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,270
Did the negotiation in St. Poplar go well?

75
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,190
Not yet. They're taking advantage
of us since we don't have materials.

76
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,900
It was the same deal with the iron in San Faldo!

77
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,450
Shipyards will end up going into
the red if things are that expensive!

78
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,450
But we'll work it out next time for sure!

79
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,410
Yeah! That's right!

80
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,250
Everyone is happy about
being able to cross the ocean,

81
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,970
but I heard that trading with
other islands isn't going well.

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,880
I wonder if the town won't
change even with the sea train...

83
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,180
But people are lively! The results
won't show immediately, Iceberg.

84
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,890
Once a man's done everything he could,

85
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,770
he should just resolutely keep his head high!

86
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,190
Yeah.

87
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,540
Hello there. Are you Mr. Tom,
a shipbuilding engineer?

88
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,710
Well, I've been looking all over for you.

89
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,920
Hm?

90
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,130
Excuse me, but I'd like to...

91
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,920
--Um...
--Don't interrupt! Step back!

92
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,840
--Yes, sir!
--I'd like to have a little conversation with...

93
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,180
I-I am...

94
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,390
...from Cipher Pol No. 5.

95
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm Spand...

96
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,610
Spandam-san!

97
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Oh, sorry!

98
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,820
I don't know who you are,
but my cannon salute hit you!

99
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,700
And...

100
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,660
...this is super! The Battle
Franky No. 35 has returned!

101
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,000
I killed a Sea King!

102
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,790
Look at this size! It's a monster
that must be at least 100m in length!

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,340
That idiot... He never learns.

104
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,390
Ahhh, you bastard! Stop it, Stupid-berg!

105
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,770
How many times do I have to tell you?

106
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,730
To think that you keep building
stupid battleships one after another!

107
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,690
Enough is enough!

108
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,020
If you can't, I'll destroy all
of them today for sure!

109
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,690
Don't you dare!
They're my precious battleships!

110
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,200
I won't let you mess with my ships!

111
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,830
Well...! Listen, Franky!
You killed a Sea King, right?

112
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,740
That means that this is quite a lethal weapon!

113
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,790
I can't understand your nerve,
just leaving dozens of them out here!

114
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,750
It's not like I'm gonna attack people with them!

115
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,500
It has nothing to do with your intention!

116
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,590
I'm calling you to account for
creating lethal weapons, Moron-ky!

117
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,130
E... Excuse m...

118
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,390
Tom-san! Please say something!

119
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,850
Moron-ky is a disgrace to our company!

120
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,560
You said "Moron-ky" again!

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,520
E-Excuse me... Please hold on a second!

122
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,610
First, I want you to apologize to me!
And then, I want you to listen to me!

123
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,660
You're from the Government,
aren't you? Is it about the trial?

124
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,660
What? What're you talking about?

125
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,620
No, I don't know anything about it.

126
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,330
Hm?

127
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,290
Tom-san...

128
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,460
What happened to Tom-san?

129
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,470
He said he wanted to talk alone.

130
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,510
He's with a man from the
Government in the brick warehouse.

131
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,930
This guy's name is Span... What was that?

132
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,640
It's Spanda-something.

133
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,650
That official isn't from the Judicial Ship.
What disorganized people...

134
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,650
I don't know about it! I don't have
any blueprints for something like that!

135
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't lie!

136
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,410
To think that you're playing innocent
just because I've been acting humble!

137
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,830
We've already investigated by going
back into the history of Water Seven!

138
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,580
If we check your belongings, the actual
article will show up in no time!

139
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,340
Do you guys have the
authority to investigate me?

140
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,050
We sure do, Tom!

141
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,430
Believe it or not,
our investigation already found out

142
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,800
that you're a heinous criminal
who built Gold Roger's ship.

143
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,180
Since you're a criminal, we can
do whatever we want with you.

144
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,270
The Government already knows it.

145
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,020
What?!

146
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,270
Can't be!

147
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,530
Then why are you working here as a
shipwright instead of being in jail?!

148
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,660
If you are an intelligence agent,
check into it yourself. See ya.

149
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,580
Hey, wait! I'm not done talking!

150
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,490
Who do you think I am?!

151
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
Oh, that...

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,710
Tom did fulfill his promise
with the Judicial Ship.

153
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,760
His charge will probably be written off
in the trial that will be held in three days.

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,970
Tom is a great man.

155
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,890
This is ridiculous.

156
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,430
Such a serious charge related
to Roger will be written off?

157
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,350
So something like that really does exist.

158
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,520
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,610
Naturally, there are pirates who're
sniffing around for these blueprints.

160
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,440
If, by chance, someone other than the
Government got their hands on them,

161
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,660
there would no longer be any
means for us to fight against them.

162
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,870
It's been more than ten years since the
dawn of the so-called Great Pirate Era.

163
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,580
Pirates have been gaining power quickly
and keep increasing in number.

164
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,870
This is no time for carefree talk

165
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,590
about things like preventing the
restoration of the ancient weapon!

166
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,920
Precisely because we uphold justice,
we should have fangs like that!

167
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,430
We'll own the ancient weapon

168
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,090
and repel this Great Pirate Era!

169
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,890
Hmm...

170
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,100
Times are changing.
There's some truth to what you said.

171
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Then obtain these blueprints
you're talking about first.

172
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,480
We'll discuss it further afterwards.

173
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,070
We'll leave this matter to you, Spandam.

174
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,900
Yes, sir! Leave it to me, sir.

175
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
After all my investigating,
I finally got this chance!

176
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,910
I'm not just gonna watch it go up in smoke!

177
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,880
Let's go!

178
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,470
Dammit! If he's not a criminal,
it'll be a problem for me!

179
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,340
Spandam-san!

180
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,600
Whoa...

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,520
The hell with writing off the charge...
How cocky... Just wait and see!

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,770
Hey! Call in five more intelligence agents!

183
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,270
Yes, sir!

184
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,200
Spandam-san!

185
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Iceberg. Franky.

186
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,770
--Hm?
--Both of you, come over here.

187
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,770
I wanna entrust something
important to you two.

188
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,690
Hm?

189
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,660
W-Why does something like this...

190
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,410
C-C-Can humans make something like this?!

191
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,540
It's the worst monster ever
in the history of shipbuilding.

192
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,130
The Government has become aware
of the existence of these blueprints

193
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,790
and has started taking action.

194
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,840
It'd be dangerous to keep them with me.

195
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,340
I'm scared... but I understand. We'll keep them.

196
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,220
This is amazing! Hey, Iceberg,
let's try building it!

197
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,520
You idiot!

198
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Ouch!

199
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Think a little before you say things!

200
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,570
I'll keep them! If something like
this is brought into this world...

201
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,150
Hm?

202
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,910
Yeah, the world will be finished.

203
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,500
But now, you can do
whatever you want with them.

204
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,080
You can even ditch them if it gets dangerous.

205
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Tom-san...

206
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,380
While I'm at it...

207
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,130
...I'll tell you one more thing
that I'm worried about.

208
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,560
Hey! Hey, wait, Franky!

209
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,930
Huh? What is...

210
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,310
At least put some pants on!

211
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,190
Geez... Didn't you learn a lesson the first time?

212
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,570
If you go to town with only a swimsuit on,

213
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,650
there'll be another perv uproar, right?

214
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,280
Geez... I'm just going shopping.

215
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,110
Now, go already!

216
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,030
Geez... To think that she's
taking the trouble to prepare

217
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,370
celebration dishes just because
Tom-san is being declared not guilty...

218
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,830
He wasn't guilty from the start.

219
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,790
Now...

220
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,090
Hey, Tom-san! Iceberg! Get up!

221
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,930
Today is the trial day!

222
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,590
Hurry up and go get judged!

223
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,890
Hurry to the harbor!

224
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,560
Tom's sentence is going to be be handed down!

225
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,110
This trial seems to be of
high interest to the people.

226
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,570
A lot of court spectators are getting on board.

227
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,570
Yes, it appears so.

228
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,530
Have you seen the sea train, judge?

229
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,290
Yeah, I took a ride once.

230
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,620
It's indeed incredible. I'm impressed
that he really made it happen.

231
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,920
Now that the four islands are connected,

232
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,300
I imagine no one would oppose his acquittal.

233
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Is Tom here yet?

234
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,840
I can't wait for it to start.

235
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,050
Hurry! The spectators' gallery is gonna fill up!

236
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah! I have to see the moment he is
declared not guilty with my own eyes!

237
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,640
This brings back memories.
It's already been 14 years, huh?

238
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,110
What?!

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
What're these explosions?!

240
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,750
Get off the ship!

241
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,960
Hurry! Hurry up!

242
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,500
What's going on?! A pirate raid?!

243
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,470
Dammit! Where are they firing from?!

244
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,680
Hm?! Over there!

245
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,890
What's that fleet?!

246
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,310
What?!

247
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,690
I've never seen battleships like them!
Which pirate group is that?!

248
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,450
What the hell is with those
heavily armed ships?!

249
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,370
Get away from the harbor!

250
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,700
Hurry up and run!

251
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,660
--Hurry!
--Run towards the town!

252
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,750
Help! My son is stuck!

253
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,180
Why...?

254
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,440
Who the hell... took... took my ships?!

255
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,350
Tom-san! There's trouble!

256
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,270
Hm?

257
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,480
Franky's ships are attacking the Judicial Ship!

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,780
Wait! It's not Franky. He's in town right now.

259
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,780
He certainly wouldn't do something
like that! I know that much.

260
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,740
That's exactly why this is trouble!

261
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,330
We'll stop them, Iceberg!

262
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,200
Yeah!

263
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,960
Are they pirates? Or someone
from the Government?

264
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,670
--Evacuate!
--Don't stop! Hurry inland!

265
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,010
Get away from the harbor!

266
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,590
My father is still inside!

267
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,680
Bastards! They won't get away with this!

268
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,190
Dammit! Who are they?!
Who's screwing around with my ships?!

269
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,240
Judge! Please hurry up!
This ship won't hold out!

270
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,410
Who does that fleet belong to?

271
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,790
The raid on the Judicial Ship was successful.

272
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,670
I see... Then move on to the next
step in the scenario immediately.

273
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,130
This is a sacrifice for justice.

274
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,630
Yes, sir!

275
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:48,180
Now, let's start the trial... Tom's Workers...

276
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,320
The Judicial Ship will sink soon.

277
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,780
Okay, then! Let's go back
to the scrap heap island!

278
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,280
Okay.

279
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,450
Hey, the fleet is withdrawing!

280
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,870
Wait... I recognize those ships!

281
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,090
Tom-san! The ships are coming back this way!

282
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,550
They're close to the shore!
I think we can catch them!

283
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,880
They sure went and did
something crazy with those ships!

284
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,810
Two people are running this way
from the scrap heap island!

285
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,600
That's Tom.

286
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,390
Okay, then! Let's leave the ship.

287
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,160
What the...?! No one is on the ships.

288
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,700
This side, too. No one is on any of the ships!

289
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,790
Well... What's going on?!

290
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,750
Those are Franky's, too.

291
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,540
Ahh! Iceberg! Watch out!

292
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,310
Dammit...! My Battle Frankys are a mess!

293
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,900
Ahh...

294
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,780
Iceberg! Tom-san!

295
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,280
Hey! Both of you...!

296
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,620
What's going on?! What happened?!

297
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,210
Are you okay?!

298
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,090
Hey! Ice--

299
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,460
You idiot!

300
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,230
That intelligence agent
who came the other day...

301
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,060
They used your battleships.

302
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,070
You got hurt by my battleships?!

303
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,570
I told you, didn't I?

304
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,610
Over... and over again...

305
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,660
I can't understand your nerve,
just leaving dozens of them out here!

306
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,370
I'm calling you to account for
creating lethal weapons, Moron-ky!

307
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,080
Tom-san got... hurt by my ships!

308
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,130
Listen.

309
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,960
Our skills can bring lethal
weapons into this world...

310
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,050
...even if you don't intend to do so.

311
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,640
Weapons hurt people despite your intentions!

312
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,140
They can even hurt those
who mean a lot to you!

313
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,480
We were taken in by the Government.

314
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,150
They're gonna make us the culprits
for attacking the Judicial Ship...

315
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,070
...because they want to question Tom-san
as a criminal to obtain the blueprints.

316
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,160
After all this... can you still
say that you're innocent?!

317
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,330
If we can't somehow stop them
from taking Tom-san away...

318
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,250
...I'll never...

319
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,880
...forgive you for the rest of my life, Franky!

320
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,240
We had a dream that day

321
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,080
Our belief in ourselves

322
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,300
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

323
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:56,850
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

324
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:06,860
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

325
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:15,660
In the end, we can all surely smile

326
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,300
I'm sorry, Tom-san. Because of me...

327
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,840
Shut up, you raiders who defy the Government!

328
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,010
That's nonsense! We didn't do it!

329
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,680
Shut your mouth! I have business
with this damn fishman!

330
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,270
What're you gonna do with Tom-san?!

331
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,480
It's all over for Tom's Workers.

332
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

333
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,270
"The End of the Legendary Man!
The Day the Sea Train Cried"

334
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,690
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
