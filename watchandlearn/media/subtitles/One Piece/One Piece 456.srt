1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Horo-horo-horo-horo-horo...

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
Edited at https://subtitletools.com

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

13
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

18
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

20
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

21
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

23
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

36
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

39
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

49
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,480
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Luffy is headed to the Navy Headquarters in order to rescue his brother, Ace!

52
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,910
Meanwhile,  the rest of the Straw Hats are...

53
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,260
"The Friends' Whereabouts! A Huge Tomb and the Panty Debt!"

54
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,210
"Gloom Island
Ruins of the Muggy Kingdom"

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,210
Meanwhile, a short time ago,

56
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,430
Zoro who was forced to stay with Perona was...

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,430
This is no good! I got to hurry!

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,060
Where did he go?! That stupid swordsman!

59
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,540
"A Few Hours Ago"

60
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,170
Dammit!

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,050
Where's the room that I was sleeping in?!

62
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,510
Is this building a maze?!

63
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,970
This way?!

64
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,070
What am I doing?

65
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,490
I thought that it'd be fun to use Negative Hollow

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,650
to make him depressed when he finds his sword

67
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,460
so I told him where his sword was but that was 2 days ago already...

68
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,220
He can't find it no matter how many hints I give!

69
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
Why're you here?! You use your Devil Fruit power again?!

70
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,360
What are you saying?! Don't accuse me!

71
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,730
You're the one who kept losing your way!

72
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,400
If you climb the stairs behind us, all the hallways lead directly to the room!

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,970
How can you get lost?!

74
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,160
Shut up! You're not clear enough!

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,710
It's not my fault at all!

76
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,920
You're a fantasista, huh?

77
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,130
It's that way!

78
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,550
How can you mishear me so badly?!

79
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,260
I didn't realize you were that pathetic without your sword!

80
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,470
It's so heartbreaking just to look at you now!

81
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,940
How sad!

82
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,770
You put me in this situation!

83
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,930
Good things will happen to you someday!

84
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,990
Fight!

85
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,990
Leave me alone!

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,680
You can have it back.

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,910
Why're you doing this?

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,370
It doesn't mean anything.

89
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,830
Even if you have your sword, you can't attack me because I'm a replica.

90
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,340
Nothing can harm this body.

91
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,700
So a swordsman like you poses no threat to me!

92
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,850
Plus, I don't want any servants who are not cute!

93
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,670
I'm not giving it back for no reason!

94
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,800
If I use him, I can go back to Thriller Bark!

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,250
Seems like he's empty-headed so I can easily handle him!

96
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,310
I'll use him as I please,

97
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,930
toy with him and leave him on this island at the end!

98
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,870
That's not so bad!

99
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,710
What?!

100
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,750
Oh no! I let him get away!

101
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,970
Where did he go?! That stupid swordsman!

102
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,400
I wonder how Luffy and the others are doing!

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,100
I gotta go back to Sabaody Archipelago!

104
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,820
I hope that they're okay!

105
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,490
Everyone focus on escaping!

106
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,990
As we are now, we can't beat these guys!

107
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,050
I can't just stay here doing nothing!

108
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,980
There he is!

109
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,440
I think I know that castle... or not...

110
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,360
I know!

111
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,010
It looks like the other castle! How confusing!

112
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,190
Do you really think so?! I'm sick of your sense of direction!

113
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,670
I can't believe how nice I am!

114
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,240
I don't have to guide him to the sea.

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,470
But it's okay! I'll take advantage of him wisely!

116
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,460
Is this the right way?

117
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,970
You have no right to ask me that!

118
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,850
I checked it!

119
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,890
Just shut up and follow me!

120
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,230
Alright.

121
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,450
Augh! What did I just say?!

122
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,950
Huh? Oh, it's that way.

123
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,320
It's this way, you stupid swordsman!

124
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,200
Huh?!

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,280
Why can't you even follow me?!

126
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,990
You have to lead the way properly!

127
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,510
Is it my fault?!

128
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,170
It's exhausting just staying with him.

129
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,630
What's the matter?

130
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,510
You got tired even though you're flying?

131
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,220
Huh?! It's your fault!

132
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,550
Why?

133
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,020
Never mind! I'll get sick just by talking to you.

134
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,400
This tree looks familiar!

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Shut up!

136
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,700
What was that?!

137
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,260
Maybe somebody else has been sent here!

138
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,450
I gotta go and check!

139
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,580
Hey, what're you going?

140
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,870
I don't need a toy like you that is just annoying and boring!

141
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,130
Wander on this island forever!

142
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,640
Who is it? I want somebody cute this time!

143
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,600
Hey, what took you so long?

144
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,260
What?!

145
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,110
W-W-Why are you here?!

146
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,960
Why? I thought that the sea was this way.

147
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,400
Y-You're really a fantasista!

148
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,590
I can't believe this!

149
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,270
This guy's really something... probably?

150
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,650
That tree must've been cut down recently!

151
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,820
How disappointing! It was just a tree falling down?

152
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,610
Nobody has been sent so that means...

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,050
...I have to settle for him for now?!

154
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,820
But I love the depressing atmosphere after a war!

155
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,710
It's so enchanting!

156
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,610
Maybe some restless evil spirits did that!

157
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,880
I doubt it.

158
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,140
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

159
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,000
Is this a...

160
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,510
...Tomb?

161
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,340
Who made this?!

162
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,400
It has carved out from a big tree. It took great skill!

163
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,060
It's very big!

164
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,270
Again! Somebody is here as I thought!

165
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,920
So fast!

166
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,940
What?! It bounced off!

167
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,190
Hey! Look at that!

168
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,750
You bastards!

169
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,450
"Lazy Bones Island
The Land of Poverty - Hungeria"

170
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,740
This is Lazy Bones Island

171
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,450
the land of poverty "Hungeria."

172
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,950
Brook was mistaken as Satan, the king of devils-- by its residents.

173
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,050
What a clear morning!

174
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,130
Luffy-san...

175
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,020
I wonder if they are all looking at the sun like this...

176
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,440
Yes, I'm sure they are!

177
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,040
Because whatever happens, the sun will always rise!

178
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,990
And if I can stay alive,

179
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,650
I will see them again!

180
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,590
Well, come to think of it, this island is very deserted!

181
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,840
And I didn't notice yesterday but inside that building,

182
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,340
there was an altar and dolls for some kind of rituals,

183
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,600
uncanny tapestries and posters on the wall,

184
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,770
and macabre-looking mural decorations.

185
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,440
And those things on the floor - are they tools for voodoo or something?

186
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,250
When I think about it, it's kind of weird!

187
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,450
Have you awoken?

188
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,920
We were just going to visit your room bringing breakfast.

189
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,120
Is that for me?

190
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,250
Yes, of course!

191
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,460
How generous you people are! You don't even know me!

192
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Oops! I haven't introduced myself yet.

193
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm the head of this country Pekkori.

194
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,970
Pekkori-san! Well then, I gratefully accept the food.

195
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,610
Young lady.

196
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,740
Could I look at your panties?

197
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,080
Panties! Hurry and show him your underwear!

198
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,570
Oh no no, um... I don't need to see the guys' underwear!

199
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,010
You don't need to hesitate! Enjoy it as much as you want!

200
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,140
What is that?! Augh!

201
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,360
Thank you for the big meal!

202
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm so full that I can barely move!

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,860
Actually, I don't have a stomach to be full!

204
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,010
That's our one-week-worth of food!

205
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,990
Be patient for now!

206
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,550
Well, Satan-sama, did you say that you wanted to ask us a favor?

207
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,690
I want to set sail right away! So I need a ship!

208
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,840
N-No! Have we done something that made you upset?

209
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,750
No.

210
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,800
Hey, everybody! Show your underwear for his dessert!

211
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,510
Enough with the underwear! Wow!

212
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,020
You don't like underwear anymore?

213
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,060
No, that's not the point.

214
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,980
I have to get back to my friends at any cost!

215
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,260
Get back?

216
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,940
Yes.

217
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
A-At any cost?!

218
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes, I feel bad because I've been treated so nicely.

219
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,530
We're over!

220
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,500
If underwear won't do it, there's nothing we can do to keep you here!

221
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,130
It's the end of this country!

222
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,130
It's come to this, we have no choice but to take our lives...

223
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,580
W-W-Wait a minute! Please relax!

224
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,390
What?!

225
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,130
Well, it seems like you have a story there.

226
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,250
That's why you call me Satan and...

227
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,730
...you said something about Longarm Tribe last night.

228
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,360
Why don't you tell me about it?

229
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:23,570
This country has been overrun by the Longarm Tribe for too long.

230
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,320
Not only money and goods and food...

231
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,250
...but they also take men and women in their prime from us.

232
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,310
And as you see, our country is devastated

233
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,130
and suffering extreme poverty!

234
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,860
Then, those meal were...

235
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,170
I'm ashamed to say this but we made them from what little food we had.

236
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,220
No way!

237
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,110
In order to get out of the situation,

238
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,970
we kept praying to all the gods and goddesses.

239
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,590
Not only that but we have invited famous psychics from around the world...

240
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,410
...to curse our enemies to death!

241
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,490
But when it didn't work, we resorted to black magic

242
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,420
and finally, we got you, Satan-sama - the king of devils, to be summoned here!

243
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,880
Satan-sama! You're our one and only hope!

244
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,260
Please deal the Longarm Tribe a bloody blow!

245
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,850
--We beg you!
--We beg you!

246
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,610
M-Me?!

247
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,610
Yes! Will you please curse them to death for us?!

248
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,860
--Satan-sama!
--Satan-sama!

249
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,200
Well, I mean...

250
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,470
It's Longarm Tribe!

251
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,370
What?!

252
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,770
No! Help me!

253
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,450
Do you wanna get hurt?!

254
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,720
Give us back the girl!

255
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,590
Quit messing with us, jerks!

256
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,430
Let my daughter go!

257
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,970
We'll give you hell!

258
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,860
Huh?!

259
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,360
No! Help me!

260
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,060
Um, do you see that they're taking the young lady?

261
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,040
Yes!

262
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,960
Put a curse on them now!

263
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,290
I beg you!

264
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,640
Huh? I mean, we got to help her now!

265
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,160
Satan-sama!

266
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,420
T-They took her!

267
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,170
But why weren't they doing anything...

268
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,250
...though someone was taking their friend or family?!

269
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,100
Why didn't they try to fight and take her back?!

270
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,350
Satan-sama!

271
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,080
I beg you! Please give them punishment!

272
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,070
We beg you!

273
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,920
They're really dependent on other people!

274
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,190
But that young lady is a victim! She doesn't deserve that!

275
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,500
Alright! I owe you for the place to stay and all the panties I saw so I'll do it!

276
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,270
Yeah!

277
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,820
Satan! Satan!

278
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,680
Satan! Satan!

279
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,220
Satan!

280
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,330
"Luffy-san and everybody!"

281
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,110
"Right now, I'm surrounded by a lot of underwear-- and am being called Satan-sama."

282
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,790
"I'm sorry but could you wait a little?"

283
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,700
"I owe them and if I don't pay them back, it'll spoil my skeleton-hood!"

284
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,690
"So give me some time."

285
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,890
"As soon as I finish this, I'll get to wherever you are!"

286
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,340
It's been almost an hour since we left Impel down.-- If the wind is right,

287
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,180
we should have reached to Navy Headquarters already!

288
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,180
Aren't we moving too slowly?

289
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,190
I don't wanna get there after everything has finished!

290
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,070
Crocodile!

291
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,200
The Navy is not the one that will beat Whitebeard! I am!

292
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,780
You still feel that way?

293
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,370
I can beat you first if you want!

294
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,100
Luffy-kun!

295
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,480
I'm on my way! Wait for me!

296
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,780
Ace!

297
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,630
Luffy and the others continue
sailing on the Tarai Current.

298
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,010
It won't be long before they reach Marineford.

299
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,810
Luffy watches the Vivre Card
to make sure Ace is still safe,

300
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,520
whiel he reminisces over his past with his brother.

301
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,730
"A Special Retrospective Before Marineford!
The Vow of the Brotherhood!"

303
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
