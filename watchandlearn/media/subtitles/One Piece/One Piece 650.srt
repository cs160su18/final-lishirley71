The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,760

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,080
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,850
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,270
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,960
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,020
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,610
he decided to enter and fight
fierce battles against other

79
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,530
tough contenders from the New World.

80
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,180
Stop whining over one punch!

81
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,920
I can't count how many times
I got punched by him!

82
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm going to smash you
to the marrow of your bones!

83
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,880
Eight-Impact Fist Technique!

84
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,700
Gum-Gum...

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,620
...Thor...

86
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,870
Non-Drill Dragon...

87
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,620
...Elephant Gun!

88
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,010
...Non-Nail!

89
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,650
Whaaat?!

90
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,730
What a man!

91
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,360
He beat the legend and
won the fierce battle for Block C!

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,240
Lucy the Gladiator!

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,010
Yeah!

94
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,370
"Luffy and the Gladiator of Fate - Rebecca!"

95
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,980
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,000
The battle royal at the Corrida Colosseum!

97
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,090
Now, three contenders have

98
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,080
gotten the chance to challenge
the Don Quixote Family!

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,870
The winner of Block A is
the "champion" of the Blackbeard Pirates,

100
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,680
Jesus Burgess!

101
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,970
From Block B,

102
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,360
the captain of a pirate group, Barto Club,
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

103
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,030
And from Block C,

104
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,880
everybody's favorite gladiator - Lucy!

105
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,350
Only one more contender can advance
to the championship.

106
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,060
However, due to the extensive
damage to the ring,

107
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,690
the start of the battle for Block D
will be delayed by 15 minutes.

108
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,620
Just fix it up already!

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,130
Don't you have a backup ring?!

110
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,570
Please wait for a while,
for the Block D match.

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,540
Straw Hat!

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,270
You can't run this time!

113
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,310
Cabbage!

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,810
Durandal!

115
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,330
Don't try to get away!

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,350
Cavendish is going at it again!

117
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,450
That bastard!

118
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,810
What's going on?

119
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,630
He's yelling "Straw Hat" again!

120
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,740
Straw Hat is the pirate who couldn't even

121
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,500
save his brother's life in the
War of the Best, isn't he?

122
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,980
Anyone could do what

123
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,740
he did if he doesn't have
to save anybody's life!

124
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,840
Wh-What are you doing?!
Cut it out, you fool!

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,350
I'm a noble of the Kingdom of Biggschots!

126
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,090
Stop it!

127
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,490
My body's gonna be crushed!

128
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,260
What was that joke you just made,
so lightheartedly?

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,780
Listen!

130
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,070
The Straw Hat Luffy-senpai

131
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,710
will eventually be
the standard-bearer of this era!

132
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,820
He's gonna become the King of the Pirates!

133
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,850
I saw it with my own eyes.

134
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,820
It was more than two years ago...

135
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,660
At Loguetown in the East Blue,

136
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,380
on the legendary scaffold where the
King of the pirates, Roger, died,

137
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,670
he shouted it out in that
desperate situation!

138
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm the man who'll be King of the Pirates!!

139
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,350
At that moment, straight from heaven...

140
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,030
...came a bolt of thunder
which saved his life!

141
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm still alive after all. I got lucky.

142
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,620
What I saw was a miracle.

143
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,230
I've been following

144
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,140
news stories on the Straw Hats
from that day on.

145
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,130
Alabasta, Enies Lobby,

146
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,880
Impel Down!

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,870
And the fateful event...

148
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,080
...at Marineford! It was all fascinating!

149
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,950
Boss! What should we do with
the soldiers that we defeated.

150
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,960
Dump them into water or something.

151
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,370
I was just some leader of a

152
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,270
gangland who took control
of 150 towns back home

153
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,500
but I've been inspired by Luffy-senpai and...

154
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,940
...sailed out to the sea!

155
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,240
Now, why don't you say it again?

156
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,830
You shut your eyes to your crappiness

157
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,000
and said something about Luffy-senpai
like you're better than him!

158
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,750
Is this the tongue you used to say it?

159
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,800
You think you're capable of doing anything?!

160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,140
You worthless shit!

161
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,690
Bartolomeo is at it, too!

162
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,730
Let it go!

163
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,340
I won't!

164
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,630
Get your hands off of my sword already!

165
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,840
Why should I fight you in the first place?!

166
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,700
I'm tired!

167
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,310
Hey, stop them!

168
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,700
We can't approach them!
It's too dangerous!

169
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,240
H-He's right! I can't approach him.
When it comes to it, I can't do it.

170
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,990
I'm too nervous to go anywhere near him.

171
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,800
The scar under his left eye... It's real!

172
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,930
He's really cool!

173
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,140
Oh? My eyes are blind with tears.

174
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,610
That stupid cabbage shit!

175
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,520
I wanna beat him to death
and save Luffy-senpai!

176
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,530
Hey you, Cav... Cavendi...

177
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,480
I can't! I can't even speak!

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,120
Hey, Straw Hat!

179
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
Listen!

180
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,050
Our old man wants to say something to you!

181
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,070
Grandpa, are you okay?!

182
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,700
What?! Leave me alone! I won!

183
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,490
No!

184
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,290
I don't even hold a grudge
against Garp anymore.

185
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,490
I want to express my deepest
appreciation to you.

186
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,850
Let me say thank you...

187
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,100
Wait, Garp's grandson!

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,980
Wait, Straw Hat!

189
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,420
He just passed by me!

190
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,110
Excuse me... Wait!

191
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,480
Hey, you can't run from a fight!

192
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,850
Wh-Wh-What should I do?!
What should I do?!

193
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,470
I wanna talk to him but how can I?!

194
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,150
Please wait!

195
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,350
In appreciation for restoring my head,

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,410
I want you to put my grandson's Happo Navy
under you command.

197
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,030
Wait!

198
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,380
What's wrong with them?!

199
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,100
So persistent!

200
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,790
--Wait!
--Wait!

201
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,520
Please wait!

202
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,590
Boy... There's no place that
I can feel comfortable.

203
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,050
This way, Lucy!

204
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,760
Oh, you're...

205
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,250
It's Rebecca.

206
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,330
You have so many enemies!
Follow me!

207
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,730
Oh, thanks!

208
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,100
By that logic, Shiryu is no different!

209
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,700
But I can't trust Aokiji!

210
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,470
Oh, hold on a sec, Captain.

211
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,040
Straw Hat is here.

212
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,580
Are you there?

213
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,980
Straw Hat.

214
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,550
You're...

215
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,730
You're...

216
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,160
...Blackbeard?!

217
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,800
Long time no see, Straw Hat!

218
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680
I was surprised, too,

219
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,440
when I heard that you were
the brother of my commander!

220
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,710
Are you sure you want to be here?
You're gonna miss it!

221
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,200
Your brother's public execution!

222
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
...Blackbeard, aren't you?

223
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,580
Yes, it's me! It's been a while.

224
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,340
I heard you're fighting
in the competition, Lucy!

225
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,080
But my man, Burgess,
is gonna win the Flare-Flare Fruit!

226
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,390
I can't wait because it'll be like having Ace
in my group!

227
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,730
He turned me down in the past!

228
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,260
You guys are the last people I want,
to have Ace's power!

229
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,350
I can't wait to fight you!

230
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,450
Let's go!

231
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,970
Lucy!

232
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,470
Yeah.

233
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,180
Do you know that pirate?

234
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,460
A little bit. I can't let him win!

235
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,810
Hey lady, there're no more samples?

236
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,380
You're gonna just keep eating
and not gonna buy anything, are you?!

237
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,160
Hey!

238
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,430
I'm sorry, ma'am!
Which one do you want, Lucy?

239
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,450
What?! Are you gonna buy it for me?!

240
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,660
Oh, Rebecca, is he your friend?

241
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,230
Thank you!

242
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,110
Yum-yum! I'm gonna eat!

243
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,380
Sorry that I don't have that much money.

244
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,450
No, thank you for the lunch, Rebecca!

245
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,050
Where are we?

246
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,670
This is a quarter
for us gladiators of the Colosseum.

247
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,790
Some people call it a prison.

248
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,410
Guest competitors wouldn't come in here

249
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,070
so you can stay here until your next match.

250
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,480
Yeah? Thanks!

251
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,440
REBECCA: A GLADIATOR ATTACHED
TO THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

252
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,970
That battle was amazing!

253
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,460
I was surprised at your strength!

254
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,010
Is it good?

255
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,230
Yeah, this Colosseum lunch box is so good!

256
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,710
Aren't you hungry?

257
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,110
Mother-sama, I'm hungry.

258
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,020
I know.

259
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,570
We haven't eaten anything for two days.

260
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,390
Rebecca, do you think you can
stay here alone for a while?

261
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,730
I don't get hungry.

262
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,770
Huh? Sounds like you're
a samurai or something.

263
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,060
I got you!

264
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,210
Rebecca, just do it!

265
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,210
What?!

266
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,250
You brought him to do it, didn't you?!

267
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,880
Hey, what's going on here, Rebecca?!

268
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,870
Hurry up!

269
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,680
Hey, my lunch is gonna spill out!

270
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,360
--Do it!
--What's wrong?!

271
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,700
If you don't do it,
you can't carry out your purpose!

272
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,570
Her purpose?

273
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,630
Rebecca got caught!

274
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,070
I can't believe he can move faster than her!

275
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,260
Do whatever you like to me.

276
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,740
I'll pay the price.

277
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,910
I'm not gonna do anything
to somebody who bought me food.

278
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,180
I tried to kill you!

279
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,470
That's okay. I'm not dead.

280
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,880
And I think you weren't gonna kill me.

281
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,770
Ow, ow, ow.

282
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,340
Being forgiven that easily
makes it more obvious

283
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,390
that it was really unevenly matched, Rebecca.

284
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,360
If we could beat one Devil Fruit eater here,

285
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,870
there was still a slight hope.

286
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,000
Huh?! Mummies?!

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,940
No, we're not!

288
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,530
We are convict gladiators!

289
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,410
So is Rebecca.

290
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
We will keep fighting

291
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,380
and get killed someday
in the ring, as part of a show!

292
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,520
Just because we protested against the
Doflamingo Family, even moderately.

293
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,880
The king says we will be released
if we can win a thousand times.

294
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,690
But no matter how tough you are,

295
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,020
you'll die when you fight to
the death a hundred times!

296
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,290
Everybody who tried to escape from here
got shot and killed.

297
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,780
There is nowhere to run for us.

298
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,750
Before Doflamingo became king a decade ago,

299
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,980
gladiatorial matches were not to the death.

300
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,870
In this kingdom that he governs,

301
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,730
there are very bright side and very dark side.

302
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,130
I'm...

303
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,610
...going to win today's competition
no matter what it takes...

304
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,680
and kill Doflamingo
with the Flare-Flare Fruit power!

305
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,560
Today, an army led by Soldier-san
will come to let us out...

306
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,820
...by provoking a battle against Doflamingo!

307
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,270
He is willing to sacrifice his life

308
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,900
to destroy this kingdom!

309
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,140
It's gonna be alright!

310
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,710
I'm a brave soldier and
I will always be by your side!

311
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,860
I'm gonna do it before he does!

312
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,400
I don't want to be just protected anymore!

313
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,450
I want to protect Soldier-san this time!
