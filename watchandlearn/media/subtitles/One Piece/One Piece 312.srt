00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,930
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,270
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,410
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,410
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,420
Thanks, Merry.

35
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,390
Thanks to you, we were able to escape.

36
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,400
I never thought that you'd come, Merry...

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,860
But when I think about it,
you've always protected us.

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm so glad that you're our friend.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,760
Thanks, Merry!

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,780
At any rate...

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,290
...you guys sure did pull one
outrageous stunt back there.

42
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,910
To start with, to think that you shot
through the World Government's flag...

43
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,600
Well... it's not a big deal.

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,640
All we did was take back a friend
who was taken away from us.

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,790
"Thank You, Merry!
Snow Falls over the Parting Sea"

46
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,870
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Usopp!

47
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,690
Where are you, Usopp?!

48
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,110
Hey!

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,410
Usopp!

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,660
Oh? He isn't here?

51
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,790
Usopp! Usopp!

52
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,870
Usopp!

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,370
Where are you, Usopp?!

54
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,310
Hey, he's calling for you.

55
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,170
O-Oh, this isn't good. Without thinking, I...

56
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,410
That's enough! Come out already!

57
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,890
If you don't, I'm gonna beat the crap outta you!

58
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,430
We're gonna beat the crap outta you!

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,610
Hey, do you know where Usopp is,
Sogeking? I can't find him anywhere!

60
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,440
D-Don't worry. He went back
ahead of us on a small boat earlier.

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,430
What?!

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,310
Why?!

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,160
But this ship actually belongs to him now...

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,870
Just what is it they need
in order to recognize Usopp?

65
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,450
Not here, either.

66
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,110
What's going on?

67
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,100
As we suspected, I can't find
anyone anywhere on this ship.

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,220
That's strange.

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,180
I wonder who on earth sailed this ship to us...

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,650
But we definitely heard
that voice calling out to us.

71
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,310
Is that right?

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,900
Yes, someone most certainly called to us.

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,150
Like I said all this time...
it was the Merry's voice!

74
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,860
What?! Really?!

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Right, Merry?! Say something!

76
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,950
You idiot. There's no way a ship would talk.

77
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,920
I kinda felt that way too, though...

78
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,630
But there's no way something
like that... could happen, huh?

79
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,980
Everything was a mystery to us, but...

80
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,480
...for some reason, these words
remained in my heart.

81
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,940
I don't even know if this person actually
said it or I was imagining things...

82
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,910
Don't worry.

83
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,740
I'll carry you guys for a little bit longer.

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
This may sound stupid, but...

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,750
...I feel that it might've been
an incarnation of the Merry.

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,680
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
You don't have to believe me.

87
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,600
Believe you?

88
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,120
This person looked like a sailor
holding a wooden hammer, right?

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,060
What...? Why...?

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,270
Do you know?

91
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,650
Brother...

92
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,450
You saw a Klabautermann.

93
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,600
K-Klabau...?

94
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,890
Klabautermann.

95
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,500
It's one of the legends known among sailors.

96
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,460
The more care the ship receives,
the more it appreciates the sailors.

97
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,470
This ship probably wanted to somehow
carry you across to the other shore.

98
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,740
She was able to encounter a crew
that she wanted to carry so badly

99
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,430
that she'd borrow a human form to appear...

100
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,900
I bet she's been very happy.

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,410
I see...

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,580
Then, the one...

103
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,130
...who talked to me then...

104
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,920
...was really you, huh?

105
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,720
Merry...

106
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,140
Hm?

107
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,140
I see a ship coming towards us!

108
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,110
Wh-What?! Who's that?!

109
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,540
It's the Straw Hats!

110
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,740
They're alive!

111
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,530
So you guys're okay!

112
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,730
The Galley-La Company's ship...

113
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,080
This is amazing!

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,700
They rushed out in Aqua Laguna and
still made it okay! I can't believe it!

115
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,700
They came back from Enies Lobby!

116
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,790
Ahoy! Ice pops!

117
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,410
Stupid-berg...

118
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,500
Nico Robin...

119
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,930
What a crazy lot.

120
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,390
They took on the World Government...

121
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,540
...and they really took everything back.

122
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,410
Merry!

123
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,710
Look! Their ship is...!

124
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,650
Hey, what's going on?!
What happened all of a sudden?!

125
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,170
All of a sudden? Isn't this just natural?

126
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,630
What?

127
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,190
It was declared that Merry could no longer sail.

128
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,100
But...!

129
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,830
The Merry is...!

130
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,610
Pops! This is bad! Merry is in trouble!
Please do something!

131
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,860
You guys... This is good timing!
You guys're all shipwrights, right?!

132
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm begging you! Please do something!

133
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,040
She's our friend who has been
traveling with us all this time!

134
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,330
And just a bit ago she saved us!

135
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,830
So please, pops!

136
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,890
Then let her...

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,810
...rest now.

138
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,730
I've already done everything I could.

139
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,700
What's this sound?

140
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,460
Is someone on the scrap heap island?

141
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,570
Isn't this... the Straw Hats' ship?

142
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,510
The damage must've been caused by
Aqua Laguna. It's in a terrible state.

143
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,020
Well, I guess it's beyond just damage...

144
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,980
I want to set sail.

145
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,230
What was that?

146
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,450
I want to set sail one last time!

147
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,390
What am I doing?

148
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,600
There's no hope left for this ship...

149
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,760
Iceberg-san!

150
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,860
What are you doing there?!
Another big wave is coming!

151
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,630
Thank you.

152
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,230
What?! You want to set sail?!

153
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,190
The sea is still stormy!

154
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,370
I'll go alone if I have to.

155
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,800
What?!

156
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,310
We can't let you go out there all by yourself!

157
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,510
I'm watching a miracle right now...

158
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,080
A miracle of a ship that
has long passed its limits...

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,590
I've been a shipwright for many years,

160
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,680
but I've never seen a pirate ship this incredible.

161
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,410
It's lived a splendid life.

162
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,100
Let's go back, everyone!

163
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,570
Back to the seas of adventure!

164
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,280
Merry!

165
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,820
I came to get you.

166
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay...

167
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,920
Well, then... are you guys ready?

168
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,880
--Yeah.
--Yeah.

169
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,830
Merry... The seabed is dark and lonesome,

170
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,010
so we'll watch you to the end.

171
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,940
Maybe it was good that Usopp wasn't here.

172
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,690
There's no way... that he could bear this.

173
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,270
What do you think?

174
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,650
I disagree.

175
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,030
Everyone must someday say farewell.
This is a man's parting.

176
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,240
Not even a single tear should be shed.

177
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,630
He, too... is prepared.

178
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:39,250
Thank you for carrying us
for such a long time, Merry.

179
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,840
Snow...

180
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,510
Whoa...

181
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,960
A caravel!

182
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:13,890
Every day we'd play
covered in mud until the sun set

183
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Yahoo!

184
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,620
Now the Going Merry pirate ship is all set!

185
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:23,470
It's hard to abandon
those innocent days we spent

186
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,670
Cheers to our new ship and crewmate!

187
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:33,370
Even if I'm a dreamer, I'm still me

188
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,840
Look at this! The Merry
got damaged quite a bit!

189
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,090
When navigating a sailboat,
everyone has to participate!

190
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:42,330
So things don't all have to fit
together like a jigsaw puzzle

191
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,570
Learn it appropriately!

192
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,840
--Aw...
--Yes, ma'am.

193
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,220
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,330
What are you doing?!

195
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,440
Cannon practice!

196
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:52,110
Just as someone's "Yes"
could be a "No" to you,

197
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,480
They sure don't fly good!

198
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,770
I'm telling you, let me try!

199
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,810
Awesome! You hit it on your first try!

200
00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:00,670
you'll surely always be free

201
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,420
Whoa...! I really hit it on my first try!

202
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:11,780
Even if tomorrow a wind passes
through and breaks the puzzle

203
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:19,640
No one would blame you for that

204
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,630
Zoro! Hey! That's my seat!

205
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,640
The entrance to the Grand Line
lies ahead of that light.

206
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,160
We had a dream that day

207
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,980
In order to find the All Blue!

208
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,810
In order to be King of the Pirates!

209
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,860
Our belief in ourselves

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,650
In order to become a master swordsman!

211
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,400
In order to draw a world map!

212
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:40,100
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

213
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,110
I-In order... to become a
brave warrior of the sea!

214
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,180
We're going... to the Grand Line!!

215
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:49,580
We know the pain that
you hold in your heart, so...

216
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:59,760
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

217
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,630
The entrance to the Grand Line is a mountain!

218
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,800
A mountain?

219
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:09,150
In the end, we can all surely smile

220
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,400
We made it!

221
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,530
This is the greatest sea in the world!

222
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,010
Go!

223
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,350
Whoa! We're flying out of it!

224
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,710
Don't look back! We're going straight ahead!

225
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,450
Let me... join your crew.

226
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,000
There's no place for me to go or go back to.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,410
So let me stay on this ship.

228
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,460
Oh, I see... Then I guess
we have no choice... Okay.

229
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,850
We continue to dream even today

230
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,330
Luffy!

231
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,380
Who's this ship's navigator?!

232
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,340
We're flying!

233
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:29,880
Carrying the feelings you
entrusted with us as well

234
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,310
Awesome! The ship is flying!

235
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,880
It's a sky island!

236
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:40,540
We once again cross these
rough seas and fight the pain

237
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:48,990
So that our promise won't become a lie

238
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:59,840
And someday, to you who departed
our ship and live in a different world,

239
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:10,430
we'll deliver the completed puzzle

240
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,100
I'm sorry...

241
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,610
I wanted to carry you even further.

242
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,570
I'm sorry...

243
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,970
I wanted to continue going on
adventures with you forever.

244
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,540
Merry!

245
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,870
A voice...

246
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,100
But I--

247
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,050
It's us who have to apologize, Merry!

248
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,640
I'm not good at steering...

249
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,010
...so I ran you into icebergs at times...

250
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,080
There was a time I tore the sails, too.

251
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,110
Zoro and Sanji are stupid,
so they broke all sorts of things!

252
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,390
Usopp would fix them each time,
but he isn't good at it!

253
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,310
So it's us who have to...

254
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,380
But I've been happy.

255
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,720
Thank you very much... for taking
good care of me all this time.

256
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,560
I really have been happy...

257
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,790
...because I had you.

258
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,950
Merry!

259
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,680
It was quite an ordeal, but we're back.

260
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,970
We're back!

261
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,920
The restoration of Water Seven starts now!

262
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,180
Hm... There seems to be a ruckus outside.

263
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,730
Grandma! The Navy is here!

264
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,030
"Peace Interrupted! A Navy
Vice Admiral with a Fist of Love"

266
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
