00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980

We can't wait until the morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel something - that's the treasure

I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

there will be a chain of burning, intense excitement!

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,040

58
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,680
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,730
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,860
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,070
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in
which a winner will get the Flare-Flare Fruit

77
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,160
as the prize - and won the first round

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,970
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law who's

79
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,670
been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,580
--Let's make our way up!
--How we go up doesn't matter, right?!

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,850
What're you up to?!

82
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,020
That must be it!

83
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,420
Where did they go?!

84
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,530
Boy! We made it straight to our destination!

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,510
Meanwhile, Usopp and Robin put Operation SOP

86
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,830
into action along with the Tontattas. However...

87
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,070
Are you still going on with this?

88
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,880
Making Sugar eat
this clump of Tatababasco Sauce is...

89
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,760
...our responsibility!

90
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,380
Doce Fleurs!

91
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,450
Do it now!

92
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,850
Put the Tatababasco grape in her mouth!

93
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,930
That's it!

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,810
Stop wasting your time!

95
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,170
"A Liar!
Usoland on the Run!"

96
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,160
What the hell is going on?!

97
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,360
They say there are some intruders.

98
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,280
But we have Trebol-sama on our side!

99
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,090
I feel sorry for them
because no one can get away from him!

100
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,290
How many times do they have to challenge me?!

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,210
I dropped my guard!
I've been turned into a toy!

102
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,880
Everybody must've forgotten about me.

103
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,430
Usopp!

104
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,630
Where did he go?!

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,450
Please, Usopp!

106
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,210
All I have is you!
Change me back into a human!

107
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,800
THE TOY HOUSE

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,040
Now is our chance! Shoot him dead!

109
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,630
Hey, wait a second! What are you doing?!

110
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,950
He's mine to kill!

111
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,230
Give yourself up, Franky, without resistance!

112
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,930
Shut up...

113
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,820
Shut the hell up!

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,040
I intend to keep wrecking the place for no reason!

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,650
Prepare for it!

116
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,150
What?!

117
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,020
If I go underground with these guys chasing me,

118
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,520
it's not gonna help the Little People!

119
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,250
I'll leave Operation SOP up to you, guys!

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,030
Bring it on!

121
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,150
I'll take care of business here!
I'm counting on you, Usoland!

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,460
THE ROYAL PALACE 2ND FLOOR
- THE SUIT CHAMBER

123
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,960
Hey! How long do I have to wait like this?!

124
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,790
What's wrong? You look pale.

125
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,670
The Little People of the Tontatta

126
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,530
have been beaten up by Trebol,
a top executive of the Family!

127
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,910
What?!

128
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,590
My friend should be with them!

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,750
Yes, there is he.
The one with a long nose...

130
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,840
Usoland!

131
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,920
But he's...

132
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
Then, let's wait!
As long as he's there, it's gonna be fine!

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,730
I'm sure Usopp will take care of it!

134
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,680
They were trying so hard to
make me eat this.

135
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,640
It must be poison.

136
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,990
Smells awful.

137
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,460
We can't do anything anymore...

138
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,020
Don't worry!

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,180
If something goes wrong,
I'll make everything right for you!

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,830
Usoland...

141
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,270
I can't believe them!

142
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,420
Move!

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,270
Where're you going, buddy?!

144
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,180
Yes! I escaped!

145
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,310
Forgive me, Tontattas!

146
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,720
Usopp! Where are you?!
Where did you go?!

147
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,120
Oh yeah! I can write a picture book
to tell future generations how brave you were!

148
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,690
"The Honest Tontattas"!

149
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,860
The title sounds great!
I need to survive!

150
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,130
It's Franky's fault!
Why hasn't he come to help?!

151
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm not gonna die for some stupid lie that I'm a hero! No way!

152
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,240
OK, I escaped from them

153
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,310
but the problem is how to get myself out of here!

154
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,330
I don't think I can get out through

155
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,440
that tunnel we came in through by myself!

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,090
Oh yeah! He said there is a lift!

157
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,330
Hey, all of you out there!

158
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,790
Hey, hey!
You didn't stop working, did you?

159
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,190
It's not a show, you fools!

160
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Oh no!

161
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,790
Get back to work!

162
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,590
Keep moving those boxes!

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,850
Don't take a break!

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,610
Hurry up, you idiots!

165
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,020
Somebody's trying to
fight the Don Quixote Family!

166
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,490
This is the first time
since I became a toy eight years ago!

167
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,720
Whoever it is, please bring down this place!

168
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,290
A show?! I've had enough of it!

169
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,130
What should we do with them?

170
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,150
...so...

171
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,570
...la...

172
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,430
Hey, hey! Are they saying something?

173
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,850
--...so...
--...la...

174
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,280
...d!

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,250
...la...d.

176
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,750
...sola...nd.

177
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,720
Uso...la...

178
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,360
U-Usola...nd.

179
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,300
Dammit! Where is the lift?!

180
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,070
Uso...land.

181
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,640
Usolan...d.

182
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,170
Usolan...d.

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,130
Usoland.

184
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,880
Usoland.

185
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,890
"Usoland"?

186
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,980
I know someone is helping you - who is it?

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,670
You mean Usoland?

188
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,520
The name he said earlier.

189
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,930
Run! Run!

190
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,950
Usoland...

191
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,170
Usoland...

192
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,720
Usoland...

193
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,120
Usoland!

194
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,290
--Usoland!
--Oh, everybody!

195
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,150
Usoland!

196
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,500
Usoland!

197
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,640
--Usoland!
--Uso...

198
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,110
Usoland!!

199
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,210
Usoland?

200
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,470
Whoa, whoa! Don't call my name!

201
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,910
Usoland? Hey, who is that?

202
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,530
It's the name of their associate he mentioned earlier.

203
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,310
You asked him.

204
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,280
Idiot. Drop dead.

205
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm not gonna die, you little shit!

206
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,770
Drop dead.

207
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,080
Drop dead.

208
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,640
Drop...

209
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,470
Usoland is our hero!

210
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,550
H-H-Hero?

211
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,810
He will save you guys, then?

212
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,560
That's right!

213
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,010
Not just us!

214
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,990
He said he will make everything right!

215
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,690
The toys who are being forced to work here, day after day.

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,190
--What?
--Is he talking about us?

217
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,800
Our friends who are enslaved in the factory.

218
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,910
The toys who look to be
walking down the street happily

219
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,710
but never stop crying inside.

220
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,240
The poor Big Humans who don't even know...

221
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,010
...that they've lost their loved ones.

222
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,880
Usoland will save them all!

223
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,060
He's the legendary hero!

224
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,140
Is that all you have to say?

225
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,140
What?!

226
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,240
No, I don't wanna be a hero! Hell no!

227
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,120
You guys are so pathetic! That's all lies!

228
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
What?!

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,900
You guys got fooled again!

230
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,490
Y-You really think so?!

231
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,760
He's not coming to help you
even though you're all hurt so bad!

232
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,130
That says it all, doesn't it?
Where's the hero?

233
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,920
So, where?

234
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,500
But he said it himself!

235
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,270
I'm sure he's laughing at you fools somewhere now!

236
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,000
Since you guys are so honest,

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,770
I bet you're not making it up and

238
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,590
there was actually somebody who told you
that he'd make everything right.

239
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,570
But he just chickened out when the need arose.

240
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,460
So you'd better abandon your hope!

241
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,670
I'm sorry but he's kind of right!
You'd better run, too, guys! Good luck!

242
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
N-No...

243
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,210
Shut up...

244
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,980
Shut up!

245
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,030
Usoland doesn't lie!

246
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,360
Shut up!

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,150
Usoland doesn't lie!

248
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,960
Usoland said...

249
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,970
I am a descendent of Noland!

250
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,360
Cool!!

251
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,220
Usoland said he will save us
no matter what happens to us!

252
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,700
That's what he told us!

253
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,520
Yeah!

254
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,960
That's right!

255
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,440
--That's right!
--That's right!

256
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,300
That's what he said!

257
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,970
He promised us!

258
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,310
The hero would never lie to us!

259
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,110
Stop insulting Usoland or...

260
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,650
...we'll make you pay for it!

261
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,000
You two had better prepare for it!

262
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,770
Once Usoland gets here, you guys will...

263
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
Pigya!

264
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,660
"Pigya"? How funny!

265
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,220
The Tontattas' death-cry is...

266
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,630
"Pigya"!

267
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,870
Leo!

268
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,870
--Leo!
--Leo!

269
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,810
Yeah! Leo is right!
Operation SOP will be okay!

270
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,660
Usoland will...

271
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,400
Usoland will pull it off for sure!

272
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,870
Pigya!

273
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,290
That's right!

274
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,930
It's you two who are pathetic!
Usoland will...

275
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,430
Pigya!

276
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,950
Pigya!

277
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,050
Pigya!

278
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,670
Just give it up already!

279
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,230
Pigya!

280
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,080
When we're in danger, the hero will...

281
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,200
Pigya!

282
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,580
Then, call the hero now!

283
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,090
Your hero!

284
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,320
Whoa! Something horrible is happening...

285
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,340
Stop...

286
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,090
Stop!

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,360
Stop!!

288
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,920
Enough already, you bastards!

289
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,870
U-Usoland!

290
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,240
Usoland!

291
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,530
Uso...land!

292
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,180
Usopp! I'm glad he's here!

293
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,630
You guys! How can you trust me that much?!

294
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,800
You little fools!

295
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,420
What?!

296
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,790
They're right! It was all lies!

297
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,230
What?!

298
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not the legendary hero
and my name is not Usoland!

299
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,430
What?!

300
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm the deadly sniper of the Straw Hats!

301
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,670
My name is Usopp!

302
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,970
I'm a pirate!

303
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,480
--O-Of the Straw Hats?!
--What is he doing here?!

304
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,150
Why...

305
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,500
Why are you saying that?!

306
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,390
You may be a pirate

307
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,380
but you're a hero, aren't you?!

308
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,400
I said I'm not! A pirate is a pirate!

309
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:42,140
Don't make me repeat myself!
I was fooling you guys!

310
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,370
But you never stop believing in me!

311
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,370
So you have...

312
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,940
...taken the trouble to come and
tell them that you were lying?

313
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,210
Yeah. Otherwise these fools will wait for me until they die!

314
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,370
Then I won't be able to sleep at night so instead,

315
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,530
I wanna thank them for believing in a guy like me

316
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,530
and I plan to sacrifice myself for them because...

317
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,130
...that's way cooler, isn't it?!

318
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,940
What?

319
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,940
My name is Usopp!

320
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,400
Remember my name, Tontattas!

321
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,180
If I die,

322
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,150
build a statue of me beside Noland's!

323
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm gonna become your legendary hero now!

324
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,440
Usopp!

325
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,790
Usopp of the Straw Hats?!

326
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,570
Is he gonna save all of us?!

327
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,740
You're desperate!

328
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,890
I'll take my chances!

329
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,880
Kill him.

330
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,530
All right!

331
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,070
Special Attack: Green Star - Platanus...

332
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,130
...Shuriken!

333
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,560
How do you like that, monster?!
I'm the legendary hero

334
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,460
and the sniper of the Straw Hats,

335
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,760
Captain Usopp!

336
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,000
Usoland!

337
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,570
No, Usopp!

338
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,540
Usoland!

339
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,900
No, I said Usopp!!

340
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,040
The legendary hero...

341
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,470
Usoland!!

342
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,880
Back in old days in Dressrosa,

343
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,360
there was a brutal man who people feared as a beast!

344
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,860
His name was Kyros!

345
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,290
When King Riku came face-to-face with this

346
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,930
wild man, a miraculous story of a legendary warrior began!

347
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,100
A Fateful Encounter! Kyros and King Riku!

349
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,470
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
