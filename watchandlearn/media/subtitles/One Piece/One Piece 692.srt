69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

76
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,660
and his friends venture into that sea.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

78
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,420
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,540
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,480
with Trafalgar Law and
have come to Dressrosa.

81
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,020
But caught up in the current
king Doflamingo's agenda,

82
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,860
they were trapped in the Birdcage
along with the entire island.

83
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,740
On top of that, he put prices
on the heads of Luffy and

84
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,980
11 others, and now they're being
hunted by all the citizens.

85
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,280
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,130
Luffy and Law are heading
to the Royal Palace!

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,460
Damn! Those meatheads were
disorganized before

88
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,050
but now they've teamed up!

89
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,510
All right! Go straight to
the fourth level like this!

90
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,680
Horse!

91
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,310
What's the matter, Farul?

92
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,840
What are those giant dolls?!

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,560
"A Hard-Fought Battle Against Pica!
Zoro's Deadly Attack!"

94
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,490
Tin soldiers?!

95
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,140
They're a little too big to be children's toys
but...

96
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,840
...more than that...

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,640
They're in bad taste!

98
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,810
Let's shear through them all at once! Farul!

99
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,170
Go!

100
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,960
Oh! One of them tripped!

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,310
Are they that clumsy?!

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
What the...!
It tried to chew on my head!

103
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,050
Stay alert!

104
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,190
We're gonna go like this!
Each of you, defend yourself!

105
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,370
Okay!

106
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,690
How could you even think
you were good enough to kill Straw Hat?

107
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,260
You bastard!

108
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,370
Damn!

109
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,550
I guess he got away!

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,010
Pulpostone!

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,390
What?!

112
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,890
Why're you guys flying?!

113
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,520
Zoro!

114
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,550
Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoro-senpai!

115
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh! D-Do you remember
you promised me your autograph?!

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,700
That's...

117
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,480
Pica!

118
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,160
Rebecca!

119
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,500
Who is it?

120
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,330
He's one of the Top Executives of the

121
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,870
Don Quixote Family along
with Trebol and Diamante!

122
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,580
Oh no! If he attacks us now,
we can't avoid it!

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,690
Zoro! Keep the enemy there for us!

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,120
We have to move beyond this stone figure!

125
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,330
THE FLOWER FIELD
THE CURRENT LOCATION

126
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,770
I can do that but...

127
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,390
...that aside, why're you guys flying...?

128
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,860
Oh? The enemy got away, didn't he?!

129
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,190
Oh boy!

130
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,240
Did he run because he's got frighten by
how strong Zoro-senpai is?!

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,950
No, he didn't get away!

132
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,620
I won't let you get to the Palace!

133
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,210
He got in there...

134
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,740
What?!

135
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,090
H-He's targeting us!

136
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,830
--Oh yeah! Your barrier!
--It's impossible!

137
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,600
First, I can't use my hands!

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,890
Plus, I can't put up a barrier that
can cover us from that massive punch!

139
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,030
No!
But if nothing is done, we're gonna...

140
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,610
...get blown away!

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,160
Three-Sword Style!

142
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,750
Thousand-and-Eighty Pound Phoenix!

143
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm starting to see how your power works!

144
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,420
Hey, you soprano-voiced fool!

145
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,220
I forgot to tell you one thing.

146
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,520
The Straw Hats are...

147
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,730
...not just Straw Hat Luffy and God Usopp.

148
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,650
Don't forget!

149
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm the man who's destined to become

150
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,240
the greatest swordsman in the world one day!

151
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,800
Doro-tenpai!

152
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,000
--The Little People are going crazy!
--Keep them down!

153
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,850
Ouch!

154
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,760
Open the door to the factory
and let our friends in!

155
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,380
Yeah!

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,540
Let's go with them!

157
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,430
Oh no! Oh no!

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,840
MOUJI - AN AIDE TO THE PRINCESS

159
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,960
Is the princess okay?!

160
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,860
Princess!

161
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,450
Mouji! Seems like Princess
Mansherry's not here on this floor!

162
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,640
What?!

163
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,330
Are... you... sure?!!

164
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,330
Then, where is she?!

165
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,710
The advance unit's making a dash for...

166
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,290
That way?!

167
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,760
I am coming! Princess!

168
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,570
No, Mouji!

169
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,120
Choo-choo! Huff-puff!

170
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,600
He's gone...

171
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,440
Manager!

172
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,400
W-We have a problem!

173
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,970
The Little People raised a revolt!

174
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,990
We're struggling to bring them
under control so we need you...

175
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,680
What are you guys doing?!
How pathetic!

176
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,650
I-I'm sorry!

177
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,140
What useless pieces of shit!

178
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,710
Stupid shrimps!

179
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,620
They're pushing their luck!

180
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,630
This is a good opportunity!

181
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,110
I'm gonna teach them a lot of lessons!

182
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,010
It's no good!
We can't get control of them!

183
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,290
Don't give up! Keep shooting!

184
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,550
What?!

185
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,550
We're not gonna get hit by
bad people's bullets!

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,930
W-Wait!

187
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,650
Aren't you worried about Princess Mansherry?!

188
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,740
What?

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,280
If you guys get out of here,
Princess Mansherry will never get cured!

190
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,330
Th-That's not good!

191
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,800
Right?! If you guys leave,

192
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm sure Princess-san will be very sad!

193
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,750
Princess...

194
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,410
No! Don't listen to them, Chao!

195
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,010
Okay, if you understand,
quit fighting and just obey us...

196
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,060
What?!

197
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,980
I put in earplugs so I can't
hear your stupid lies anymore!

198
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,970
Tontatta Swing!

199
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,910
--Report Young Master-sama!
--O-Okay!

200
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,870
You can't do that!

201
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,130
Tontatta: Tail...

202
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,000
...Four-man Hammer!

203
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,440
Everybody! Release all
their Transponder Snails

204
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,510
into the wild so they can't call for backup!

205
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,530
Are you listening?!

206
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,470
What?

207
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,300
What?

208
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,710
What?

209
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,850
Earplugs!

210
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,780
Now, let's hurry up and open the door!

211
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,030
What?! Princess is...

212
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,490
Princess Mansherry is not sick?!

213
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,280
Inhel and the others outside said...

214
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,000
That's what I thought!
We've been totally fooled, haven't we?!

215
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,750
Where's the princess?!

216
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,350
--U-Ummm...
--They split up and went to look...

217
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,090
I see!

218
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,050
That way, huh?!

219
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,220
Oh, wait!

220
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,620
It's good that her illness was a lie!

221
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,800
But she's been alone all
this time in the factory...

222
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,020
I understand!

223
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,650
--Mouji... I Mouji understand your feelings!
--Wait!

224
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,330
I know the princess is crying now!

225
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,280
She's crying and calling out my name!

226
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,530
There's a Little Person!

227
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,760
Calling "Mouji! Mouji!"

228
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,140
Princess!

229
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,450
Mouji!

230
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,670
Princess!

231
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Princess!

232
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,920
Please wait for me!

233
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,260
Oh, it says "Don't run" in this hallway.

234
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,390
We have to keep left.

235
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,500
Mouji!

236
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,040
There is the isolation ward!
Princess Mansherry must be in there!

237
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,070
I'm gonna save you now!

238
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,970
Oh, wait a second!

239
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,370
Why did you stop me?!

240
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,030
Look at that sign!

241
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,370
It says "Keep out"! We can't go in!

242
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,460
Gah! What?!
You should've told me earlier!

243
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,130
I can't slow down now!

244
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,760
Mouji broke the door with
the "Keep out" sign!

245
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,140
I'm disappointed in you!

246
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,120
It means you're not allowed
to go in without permission!

247
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,310
I'm sorry...

248
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,620
No one's in here! Is it just storage?

249
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,330
No... Can't believe it...

250
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,200
P-Princess... Where is the princess?!

251
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,790
Are you ready?!

252
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,830
Here we go!

253
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,460
Hurry up!

254
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,870
IN FRONT OF THE SMILE FACTORY

255
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,890
Oh! You're so relentless, Señor!

256
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,560
Hurry up!

257
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,750
There!

258
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,530
Is that it?

259
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,860
Boy... You're such a tough guy.

260
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,520
Almost!

261
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,740
Franky Ear.
Which is not to say...

262
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,050
...it's a special mechanism or something.

263
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,840
It's just Franky naturally has good hearing.

264
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,760
Hey, swimming guy...

265
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,080
It's none of your concern but...

266
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,520
...earlier...

267
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,820
I saw a weak old granny having trouble
in the back street on the right!

268
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,540
Oh yeah? That's sad.

269
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,680
Señor?

270
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,500
I just remembered
I have some minor business to attend to.

271
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,590
Oh! Wait a second!

272
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,210
Turn the wheel and open the door!

273
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,460
--Let's help them!
--Yeah!

274
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,790
Hold on! Shrimps!

275
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,680
What?!

276
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:56,750
KUWEEN (20 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)
FACTORY MANAGER OF THE SMILE FACTORY

277
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,530
You're pushing your luck!

278
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,690
I won't let you get out!

279
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,780
No! It's the factory manager!

280
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,410
You guys were slaves for manufacturing SMILEs
right from the start!

281
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,220
Didn't you notice until now?!

282
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,620
Stop making a ruckus like fools!

283
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,130
Watch out for the suction device!

284
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,070
She wants to suck us all up
and recapture us!

285
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,530
You can't get away!

286
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Cleaning, cleaning!

287
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,210
If nothing is done,
we're all gonna get caught!

288
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,090
Open the door already!

289
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,300
--Hurry up!
--I'll help you!

290
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,320
Won't let you do it!
Vacuuming power up!

291
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,060
You're persistent!
Just give up already!

292
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,230
No, we won't! We're gonna
open the door no matter what!

293
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,980
Well done. Guys!

294
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,550
Finally released from the SMILE Factory,
the Tontattas are ecstatic!

295
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,180
But their princess

296
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,090
Mansherry's whereabouts is still a mystery

297
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,120
and concerns and confusion spread among them!

298
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,380
Meanwhile, the hard-boiled fight
between Franky and Señor

299
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,310
grows to include Kuween
and gets even more heated!

300
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,110
"The Little People's Princess! Captive Mansherry!"

302
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,220
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
