up the "end of the dream"

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

We are the one! Go ahead!

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,480
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,720
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,710
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,780
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,870
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,630
When Luffy found out that
the prize for a fighting

77
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,400
event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,490
The first round is a battle royal
where only one can win.

79
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,500
Burgess from the Blackbeard Pirates won
the match of Block A.

80
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,760
Now, the battle of Block B is about to start.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,480
Straw Hat.

82
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,110
I visited the Sky Island.

83
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,240
I lost my crew but it turned my
view of the world upside down.

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,630
You didn't do anything to the people there,
did you?!

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Maybe. Maybe not.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,240
Anyway, I'm not holding a grudge
against you anymore.

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,660
I'm gonna get on board Doflamingo's ship

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,880
to ride through the "wild wave"
that will come soon or later.

89
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm done picking on you.

90
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,190
Can I watch it with you, Lucy?

91
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,990
Of course, you can!

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,480
Now, the next competitor to enter is...

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,300
...a latecomer!
He's in Block B, too!

94
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,600
It only took him a year to become infamous

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,170
and enter the New World!

96
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,580
An incomparably brutal and crazy rookie!

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,950
He roasted some pirates on a skewer
and shared the video!

98
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,020
And he also bombed some innocent civilians!

99
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,370
He ranked No.1 in the "most
annoying pirate who should

100
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,570
just go away" competition!

101
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,280
A pirate -

102
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,190
Bartolomeo!

103
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,810
"A Super Rookie!
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!"

104
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,760
All of you!

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,560
Go to hell!

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,000
What did you say, you asshole?!

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,670
Go home!

108
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,940
You go to hell!

109
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,930
Don't throw stuff!
Please don't throw stuff!

110
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,520
Hm? What?

111
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,580
Oh? Why is everyone so angry?

112
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,790
Because of him.

113
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,850
THE CAPTAIN OF A PIRATE
GROUP - THE BARTO CLUB

114
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,060
He's the captain of a pirate
group called Barto Club -

115
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,320
BARTOLOMEO THE CANNIBAL
BOUNTY: 150 MILLION BERRIES

116
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,110
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

117
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,550
Go away!

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,620
What are you doing, you bastard?!

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,630
What is that?

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,390
What?

121
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,480
Don't tell me it's...

122
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,840
It's a bomb!

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,980
It's packed and I can't get out!

124
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,370
Move aside, old man! You're too slow!

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,580
You're in my way, too!

126
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,720
You have to let ladies go first!
Let me out!

127
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,720
Forget the others, just help me!
I'll give you my money!

128
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,830
It's landing!

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,190
A ball...

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,860
Gross.

131
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,080
Gross!

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,590
Gross!

133
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,790
They hate you so much, brat.

134
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,090
I don't even want those shitheads to like me.

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,660
He's smiling. That guy's so weird.

136
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,900
He's not just a menace
but he also has an insolent manner.

137
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,900
Unlike me, he has a bad reputation.

138
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,160
Damn Bartolomeo,
how dare he make fools of us!

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,040
But there is another competitor for Block B!

140
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,580
He's the last one!

141
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,740
He's nothing like that Crazy-lomeo!

142
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,030
He admires our king - Doflamingo

143
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,420
and declared his loyalty to him

144
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,430
by bringing him a giant gold
pillar from a distant country!

145
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,310
Oh, don't tell me it's...

146
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,400
Since then, he's been
destroying various towns

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,680
in many countries where they insulted us...

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,330
...by calling us a barbaric kingdom of pirates,
and bringing them to terms!

149
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,050
He is the "Bullet of Dressrosa"!

150
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,360
He has been given a chance
by the royal finally!

151
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,200
Here comes a leading competitor of Block B.

152
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,620
If he wins this competition,

153
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,090
his tenacity will bear fruit

154
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,590
and it has been decided that
he will get promoted to

155
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,350
an executive position in
the Don Quixote Family!

156
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,470
He is a real contender for
winning this competition!

157
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,950
A pirate!

158
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,890
Bellamy the Hyena!

159
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,280
--Bellamy!
--Bellamy!

160
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,570
Bellamy!

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,480
Now, all 138 competitors are in the ring!

162
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,290
He can't be that popular
even if this is his home.

163
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,730
There are so many!

164
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,250
They're gonna fight at once, aren't they?

165
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,730
Where should I look?

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,190
It sure is a battle royal
but this is just a preliminary round.

167
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,390
There is no chance for the weak to win.

168
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,730
You can just focus on the big names.

169
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,180
Do you want me to tell you
who I think has a chance?

170
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,080
Ah, please!

171
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,490
The king of the Prodence Kingdom.

172
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,260
"The Fighting King" - Elizabello II!

173
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,270
And his tactician.

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,080
Dagama!

175
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,540
A Jiaokungdo martial artist
from the Longfeet Tribe.

176
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,860
Blue Gilly!

177
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,360
The Military Captain of
Dressrosa's Self-Defense Army.

178
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,580
Tank Lepant!

179
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,520
A criminal - Abdullah!

180
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,500
Another criminal - Jeet!

181
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,320
A master of the Fish-Man Karate

182
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,720
and a martial artist of the Fish-Man Jiu-Jitsu.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,660
Hack!

184
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,850
Lastly, the pirates - Bellamy and...

185
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,370
...Bartolomeo.

186
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,770
One of them will win this match, I suppose.

187
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,350
Hmmm...

188
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,610
Can you repeat that?

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,880
What the hell?

190
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,390
Alright, the battle royal of Block B
is about to begin!

191
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,220
A competitor will be eliminated
if he gets killed in the ring!

192
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,490
Or if he gets thrown out of the ring!

193
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,740
There will be only one winner!

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,450
Let the battle...

195
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,720
...begin!

196
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,200
Now, who should I start with?

197
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,570
Bellamy!

198
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,790
Five men at once, already?

199
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,280
Spring Hopper!

200
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,640
H-How strong?

201
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,500
He's so great!

202
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,050
Bellamy!

203
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,050
What the hell? It's like an army!

204
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,420
That's not fair! They're teaming up!

205
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,330
That's not a battle royal!

206
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,380
You can call us cowards
as you like after you die!

207
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,040
There will be only one winner!
All we need is to win!

208
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,580
Looks like we have some competitors
who are fighting together!

209
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,760
Is that allowed?

210
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,850
It's not sportsmanlike
but it's not against the rules, I think.

211
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,140
The man behind such a trick must be...

212
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,790
...Dagama, a tactician
of the Prodence Kingdom.

213
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,620
We the Prodence Kingdom will take home
the Flare-Flare Fruit.

214
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,650
Our king - Elizabello II was born to be
a weapon of destruction!

215
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,320
A punch that is thrown
from his naturally gifted

216
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,420
physique is terribly powerful...

217
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,980
He blew a hole

218
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,520
in an enemy country's fort
with a single blow, shocking the world!

219
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,560
However, his power has one drawback.

220
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,500
It takes an hour to increase

221
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,460
concentration and warm up to throw one punch.

222
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,770
He can only use it once per battle!

223
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,740
They say it could take

224
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,500
down even the Four Emperors
if it hits them. The "King Punch"!

225
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,240
His victory depends on his timing!

226
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,410
King-sama, how is the preparation going?

227
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,220
It's gonna take a while. Guard me.

228
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,090
As you wish!

229
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,280
I need you guys to earn your salt!

230
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,840
Protect the king and

231
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,360
cut down the number of the
competitors in the ring!

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah!

233
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,260
The king's punch that broke down a fort...

234
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,160
I heard about it.

235
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
They're trying to buy themselves some time

236
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,440
to throw the punch, aren't they?

237
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,000
The punch! No way!

238
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,580
I'm gonna kick his ass before he throws it!

239
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,970
Oh shit! I'm gonna fall!

240
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,820
Three competitors got eliminated
by being thrown out of the ring!

241
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,830
And of course,
in the water outside of the ring...

242
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,730
The Colosseum's unique attraction!

243
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,800
Get them!

244
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,410
A school of Little Fighting Fish!

245
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,330
Doesn't matter if you're in
or out of the ring! It's Hell!

246
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,400
No one can survive uninjured!

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,060
That's the Corrida Colosseum!

248
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,120
Is it okay, Lepant?

249
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,870
For the captain of Dressrosa's army to help

250
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,100
a tactician from another country?

251
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Bellamy, money controls this world!

252
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,010
They bought you off, huh?

253
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,750
Should I fight him, Dagama?

254
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,380
Yes, let's get rid of those
pains in the ass first

255
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,740
before we lose too many people on our side.

256
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,200
Be ready for it, Bellamy!

257
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,520
I'd rather make easy money
than chase a big dream!

258
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,560
That makes my ears burn.

259
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,000
You can't hit me like that!

260
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,000
Spring...

261
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,300
...Death Knock!

262
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,760
Bellamy! Go for it!

263
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,730
Bellamy!

264
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,030
It's not easy to beat him as I thought.

265
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,550
He got so much stronger!

266
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,210
It's so exciting to see
so many different people!

267
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,430
He's pretty strong, too!

268
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,890
Indeed.

269
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:35,210
The gladiator - Ricky...
His background is a total mystery.

270
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,940
Who do you think is gonna win?!

271
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,350
How do I know?! It just got started!

272
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,990
--Look at him!
--What?!

273
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,810
What are you doing?!
Do you wanna get killed?!

274
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,890
Why isn't anybody attacking him?!

275
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,230
Bartolomeo!
If you're not gonna fight, go home!

276
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,940
I wish somebody would kick your ass already!

277
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,610
He's fooling around again.

278
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,550
That guy is one of those annoying newcomers,

279
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,490
just like Straw Hat Luffy.

280
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,910
I need to take care of him,
too, in this competition.

281
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,930
What are you doing, Cabbage?!

282
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,710
I'm checking the wanted posters of
the Worst Generation.

283
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,030
But I have to get new ones.

284
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,780
I can barely see their pictures
with these knife cuts.

285
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,240
Why don't you just let it go already?

286
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,880
No way!

287
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,230
I'll kill them!

288
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,550
There is a big prize for this competition.

289
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,980
I was hoping Apoo or Kid or at

290
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,950
least one of them
would enter but...

291
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,550
...I don't know yet
if any of them are here or not.

292
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,700
They can hide their face
like Burgess did earlier.

293
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,580
If any of them are here,

294
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,790
should I wait for them to move
on to the next round or...

295
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,240
Oh, is this the place to watch the battle?

296
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,970
You're...

297
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,510
We have a good view of the match from here.

298
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,720
T-T-Too tight!

299
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,640
Oh, excuse me.

300
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,590
Who are you, old pops?

301
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,410
By the way,

302
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,810
how is Garp-san doing?

303
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,280
Straw Hat Luffy-kun!

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,420
What?

305
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,620
You know my grandpa?

306
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,820
What?!

307
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,740
I almost got killed by Garp-san once.

308
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,720
And I've made up my mind to carry the

309
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,030
grudge even against his
children and grandchildren.
