2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,610
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,010
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,860
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,730
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,240
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,840
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,100
Big Bro!

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,060
Even if it's an injury that kills
ordinary people, I must not die!

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,930
Dragon Twister!!

27
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,960
I have to hurry up and rescue Luffy...

28
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,170
Such an idiot!

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,430
Sorry. This is all we can do right now.

30
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,940
I see. That means that if
I kick and break that rock...

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,330
Realize... that you all are mere humans!

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
"Proud Warriors!
Sanji and Usopp's Fierce Battles"

33
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,160
Hmph! A man from Cocoyashi Village...
You're wasting your time...

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,980
Dammit! He found me!

35
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,110
What's the point of
extending his life like that?!

36
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,230
I'll sink you as well!

37
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,240
No way I'll let you!

38
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,070
You damn human!

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,220
Are you seriously trying
to fight me in the water?!

40
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,240
You're an inferior species that has
to worry about holding your breath!

41
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,560
Okay, I'll fight.

42
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,600
Fishman Karate! Duelling Hair Tether!

43
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,050
You son of a...

44
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,450
What's that? The power of
your kick dropped in half.

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,820
That's the limit for humans.

46
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,780
But Fishman Karate's power
doesn't drop even in the water!

47
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,580
Rather, depending on the
technique, the power doubles.

48
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,650
Fishman Karate! Instant Undersea...

49
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,050
...Bowel Buster!!

50
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,640
Fishman Karate!

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,370
Flaming Axe Kick!

52
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,970
Back Foot Jawbreaker!

53
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,280
Special Attack!

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,330
Guffaw Palm Bomb!!

55
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah!

56
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,780
Air! Air! Air! Air! Oxygen! Air!
I let out too much air! I can't breathe!

57
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,820
Where're you going?

58
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,720
Dammit! Let me through.
I need air! Let me breathe!

59
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,660
Seriously, what amazing strength...

60
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,510
I can't believe he's human.

61
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,310
Let me breathe...

62
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,600
If I remember correctly,

63
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,100
you said that those
who harm a lady are crap.

64
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,610
But look how it's turning out.

65
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,050
This is the outcome
of your cheap chivalry.

66
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,980
You won't be able to escape
from me and will die.

67
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,990
That policeman and the
rubber man will also die.

68
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,260
Zoro, that long-nose man and the
rebel villagers... They'll all be killed.

69
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,790
With all that's happened, Nami
won't get away with betraying us!

70
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,960
Do you get it?

71
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,850
With your superficial chivalry,

72
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,460
you can't protect anyone,
let alone Nami, after all!!

73
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,510
Even if you're kinda strong,

74
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,820
that's just silly talk by a helpless human.

75
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,010
You humans can't handle a sudden
change in water pressure, right?

76
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,520
In other words, if you
rapidly dive into the abyss...

77
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,170
your organs will burst out of your body.

78
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,140
Pulverizing Pressure Plunge!!

79
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,490
I'm not gonna let him get away with this!

80
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,080
I can't protect anyone?!

81
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,450
This man won't die yet?

82
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,820
Then, I'll give you that attack as you wish!!

83
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,210
They use pulmonary respiration on land
but switch to branchial respiration in water.

84
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,780
Which means that he's just
a talking fish right now.

85
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,300
Can you bear a second time?

86
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,610
A fish'll die if air is
shot into its branchia.

87
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,580
If you're also a fish,
you'll feel the same pain!

88
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,850
Hm?

89
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,280
You...

90
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,700
Hey...

91
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,410
Don't worry. He's okay.

92
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,500
Really?!

93
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,460
Yeah, sort of.

94
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,580
Sort of?

95
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,580
I'll explain it later.

96
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,810
Anyhow, come out of the water,
you damn fish! Let's settle this!

97
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,420
You still don't get it, do you?

98
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,090
Whether it's in the water or
on the ground, it's the same.

99
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm really angry!

100
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,930
I'll make you experience the
essence of Fishman Karate!

101
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,260
The earlier attack I used to send you
flying was the Hundred-Brick Fist!

102
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,630
But my ultimate attack
is the Thousand-Brick Fist!

103
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,650
Your survival probability is... zero!!

104
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,330
Collier!

105
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,410
My chivalry is naive?

106
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,490
Epaule!

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,200
I can't protect anyone, you said?

108
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,750
Cotelette! Selle! Poitrine!

109
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,880
Gigot!

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,640
You...

111
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,970
Son of a bitch!
Ultimate Fist! Thousand-Brick!

112
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,060
Mouton... Shot!!

113
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,250
I guess...

114
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,940
...he doesn't want dessert?

115
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,320
What was that?! What's happening?!

116
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,230
Kuroobi...

117
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,230
Hachi...

118
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,270
They're small fish, after all.

119
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,220
It's a million and fifty thousand years
too early for them to go against a cook.

120
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,280
We win this game.

121
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:16,550
How dare you bastards beat my
dear brothers one after another...?

122
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,990
Aren't you getting a
little too carried away?!

123
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,660
Hey, what do you mean
by Luffy being sort of okay?

124
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,240
It means that he won't
die for the time being.

125
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,170
But to revive him, I have to go
into the sea one more time...

126
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,990
...though it doesn't seem like
that guy's gonna let me...

127
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,520
Amazing... They're really amazing!

128
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,100
They beat two of the
Arlong Pirates' leaders!

129
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,020
This is it. I can no longer hold my breath!

130
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,610
Gen-san, take my place.
I'll go in this time.

131
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,380
His color has improved considerably.

132
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,360
He spit out quite a bit of water.

133
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,700
What's going on over there?

134
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,860
Don't worry. Everyone's still alive.

135
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,240
In fact...

136
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,740
...although it's hard to believe,

137
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,890
this fight is giving me hope...

138
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,640
the hope that I've been holding back...!

139
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,950
Geez... Causing me all these troubles...

140
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,500
What amazing ability to run away!

141
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,480
But that was too easy... He died
instantly with a shot of my Squirt Gun.

142
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,810
Hmph! I guess I should head back.
The others should be done by now.

143
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,330
I'm saved! It worked!

144
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,630
I'm so glad I made Ketchup
Star for times like this.

145
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,320
He thinks his Squirt Gun or whatever
actually hit me. Go back already!

146
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,290
Seriously... What a scary species they are...

147
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,760
They turned the houses
in town upside down...

148
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:39,410
Well, I feel sorry for Nami and
I really want to help her, but...

149
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,400
Hm?

150
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,270
I guess it was just my imagination.

151
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,550
I think I'll pass on dying.

152
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,570
B... But actually, although
I'm covered in fake blood,

153
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,850
I want something that shows
a trace of deadly combat.

154
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,240
Oh, yeah. If I show up with my body all
covered in mud, it may look that way.

155
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,830
I'd say something like, "Ahh, sorry. I lost."

156
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,320
Hmmm. I wonder if, "Well,
I let that bastard slip away,

157
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,120
though I was this close," is better...

158
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,310
Or that may not be quite convincing...

159
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,270
We're friends now, aren't we?

160
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,730
"Well, don't cry, Nami.
We only did what was right."

161
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,940
I'd rather die than lose.

162
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,470
"Well, we all fought very well."

163
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,730
He's 100 times better than a
damn gang that'd hurt a lady.

164
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,070
"Well, it certainly was a deadly combat."

165
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,270
It's for my business!
This was my only choice!

166
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,660
"Well, my injuries aren't that bad."

167
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,000
Big Sis Nami was crying.

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,640
Do they need any more reason than
that to put their lives on the line?

169
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,330
Nami was only ten. Do you know
how painful of a choice it was?

170
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,490
Let's fight!!

171
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,400
"Well, the way... I fought... was really..."

172
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,710
How...

173
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,670
How shameful...!

174
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,410
How... shameful I am!

175
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,520
Hold it, you damn fish!!

176
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,150
Oh? You're still alive?

177
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,370
Of course! No way that staggering
shots by a half-fish would hit me!

178
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,640
The moment I left my village,
I gave up on things...

179
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,430
...like peace and safety...

180
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:09,120
Because they live risking their lives
everyday, they laugh so happily!

181
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,010
That's why I decided
to set out to the sea.

182
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,330
I wanted to laugh from the
bottom of my heart, too!

183
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,380
If I don't fight with all my might here,

184
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,660
I won't have the right to be
on board the same ship as them.

185
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,130
I won't have the right to laugh from
the bottom of my heart with them!!

186
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,130
Are you an idiot?

187
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,310
You should've just pretended to be dead...

188
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,720
Even your brain is inferior...

189
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,790
I'm done...

190
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,540
Yeah, you're right!
You're already done for!

191
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,300
I'm done!

192
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,300
Usopp Hammer!

193
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,250
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

194
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,000
Ahhh! Dammit!

195
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,180
What a stupid trap I fell into!

196
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,330
That son of a bitch...!

197
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,370
Special Attack! Lead Star!

198
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,510
Alcohol?

199
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,580
How dare you do all these
impudent things, you feeble species!

200
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,230
No matter where you hide, I'll blow
you away using this rice field water!

201
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,380
Impudent or whatever... It doesn't matter.

202
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,160
At any rate, as a man,
I can't run away from this fight.

203
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,710
Yeah, if I lose, I'll die.

204
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,640
But I'm already a pirate!

205
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,100
Squirt Cannon!

206
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,270
Oh, my... What power...!

207
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,990
Why do I have to fight
against an idiot like that?

208
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,730
He's completely exposing himself!

209
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,440
You're gonna be swiss cheese!

210
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,670
Squirt Machine Gun!

211
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,670
Ahhh! H-How did he
figure out where I was?!

212
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,110
Dammit! Dammit! Just watch me,
Usopp Pirates, Kaya!

213
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,730
I set off to the sea and became a pirate!!

214
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,950
I'll fight! In order to become a real,
brave sea warrior, not a fake one!

215
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm done pretending to be a pirate!

216
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,630
What'd you say's done?

217
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,350
This fight! You know,
alcohol catches fire!

218
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,120
Special Attack! Fire Star!

219
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,640
Ow! Ow! Ow! Water! Water!
Water! Water! Water! Water!

220
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Ow! Ow! Ow!

221
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,360
This isn't good!

222
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Water, water, water! Water!

223
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,840
Usopp Hammer!!

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,010
You son of a bitch...!

225
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,010
Ugh! Usopp Hammer!

226
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,010
Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!

227
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,350
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!

228
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,680
Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!

229
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,450
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!!

230
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,070
I win! I beat a fishman!

231
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,560
It serves you right!

232
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,380
I can do it, too, if I try!

233
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,570
Did you see that?!

234
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,150
Don't make light of me, you bastards!!

235
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,300
Please... come back to life!

236
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,560
Come back to life quick!
Or it'll be too late!

237
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,510
Your friends are... Your friends are...!

238
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,470
I thought that they had a chance in
this fight. Was it just a dream...?

239
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,860
What did that damn shark do?

240
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,990
I don't know.

241
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,980
As soon as he shot water,
they both vomited blood and flew...

242
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,200
I can kill humans like you

243
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,410
without even directly touching
you if I have some water.

244
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,920
That's the difference
between fishmen and humans.

245
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,130
Give me a break!

246
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,170
This isn't funny...

247
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,600
Just a water shooting game to him
is like a shotgun shot to us...

248
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,140
So this is the power of a shark...

249
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,360
And he's in a class by
himself among fishmen...

250
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,140
He's in another league...

251
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,190
Die already.

252
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,450
Your lives are not worth that much.

253
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,210
Arlong!!

254
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,690
Big Sis Nami!

255
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,940
Nami-san!

256
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,400
Nacchan...

257
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,250
Hey, Nami! I was about to
crush some pirates just now.

258
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,120
What did you come here for?

259
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,300
To kill you...

260
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

261
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

262
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

263
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

264
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

265
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

266
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

267
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

268
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

269
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

270
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

271
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,980
I'll hold back that half-fish bastard.
You go into the sea!

272
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,840
Yeah! Leave Luffy to me!

273
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,310
All right! I've got your back!

274
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,260
Hey! You've got my back from that far?!

275
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,270
Ahh... My "Do Not Fight
Arlong" disease is...

276
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,320
That's a lie, isn't it?

277
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,660
Ahh! I'm saved!

278
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,860
On the next episode of One Piece!

279
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,990
"Luffy at Full Power! Nami's
Determination and the Straw Hat"

280
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
