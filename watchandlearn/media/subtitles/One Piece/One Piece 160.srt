00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,410
"Upper Yard" "Lovely Street"
"Angel Beach"

20
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,670
After a great adventure,

21
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,490
Luffy and his crew finally
reached the sky island of Skypiea.

22
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,520
However, Nami's group was taken
away by "Heaven's Judgment,"

23
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,120
and Luffy's group, on their way
to God's Island to get them,

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,610
encountered trap after trap...

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,250
Gum-Gum...

26
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,840
...Bazooka!

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,790
Meanwhile, Nami's group,
which was taken to a sacrificial altar...

28
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,800
He has priests on this island too, you know!

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,590
Anyway, we can't make God angry!

30
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,850
It's common sense, you know!

31
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,100
Sorry, but...

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,820
...I've never once prayed to God.

33
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,230
And so, Zoro's group left Chopper
behind and entered the forest...

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,540
I'm the one in the most danger!

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,590
"10% Survival Rate! Satori, the Mantra Master!"

36
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,020
Where is this God, anyway?

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,730
If he's a god, he might have already
foreseen our actions long ago.

38
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,270
Things'd be a lot faster if he came to us...

39
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,070
I'd rather he not show up!

40
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,800
How many times do I have to tell you?!

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,570
The god on this island is horrible!

42
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,230
Oh, Lord... Please stay nice and peaceful...!

43
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,500
Oh! And please let us find some treasure...

44
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,510
Is that what you care about?!

45
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,220
Anyway, walking along the
river won't get us anywhere...

46
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,220
We should cross and check out the other side.

47
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes.

48
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,760
But how?

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,360
Use a vine to swing across like before?

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,060
Or do we climb a--

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,960
Damn! They're here, too?!

52
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,130
F-Forget it! I am not crossing this river!

53
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,610
We'd pretty much be feeding
ourselves to the skysharks!

54
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,920
But there's no guarantee we can get across

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,520
even if we keep walking along the river!

56
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,350
I said forget it!

57
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,530
If you're gonna go,
then you can go alone, Zoro!

58
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,910
If you're that scared, you shouldn't
have come in the first place!

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,110
Say... This ground...

60
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,910
What about it?

61
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,950
It's dirt.

62
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,910
Of course it is. It's ground.

63
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,540
This is a sky island.

64
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,490
You're right.

65
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,820
It isn't all fluffy...

66
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,400
Eh? Oh, right!

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,990
Sky islands are made out of island cloud...

68
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,390
It feels like such a long time
since I've touched dirt like this...!

69
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,850
Why is this island different?

70
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,140
In any case, it's certain that
this is an unusual sky island...

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,820
Looks like checking into
it might be worth a lot...

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,230
A Level 2 Crime, huh?

73
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,190
Who do you take God for?!

74
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,360
Choose an ordeal...

75
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,660
We shall present it with our own hands...

76
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,130
Sin is living in ignorance.

77
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,920
The means to attaining peace
do not lead into Heaven...

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,380
"Swamp Ordeal"

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,380
Swamp!

80
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,840
"Iron Ordeal"

81
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,480
Iron!

82
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,340
"String Ordeal"

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
String!

84
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,800
"Ball Ordeal"

85
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,450
Ball!

86
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,740
Choose an ordeal!

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,770
So, what do we do?

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,730
Alright! Let's go with "Ball"!

89
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,670
Why's that, Luffy?!

90
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,480
It sounds fun!

91
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,880
That's your reason?!

92
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,690
These are ordeals!
They're not gonna be fun!

93
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,770
No, but I agree with "Ball."

94
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,870
It's the only one that
doesn't sound too violent...

95
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,460
I mean, "swamp" makes me think of...

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,520
I'm sinking! Someone!

97
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,130
I get the feeling that once you sink,
there's no coming back up...

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,970
Then what about "Iron"?

99
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,930
They're gonna hit us!

100
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,890
Denied! That sounds totally bad!

101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,720
Then what about "String"?

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,980
It sounds easy, and not too bad at all, but...

103
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,530
High up!

104
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,110
N-No!

105
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,490
Its easy sound makes it seem suspicious!

106
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,750
"Ball Ordeal"

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,740
A huge ball!

108
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,710
Squish!

109
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,170
It sounds round and soft,
but it's the most likely to be a trick!

110
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,750
We really need to think this over!

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,400
There's no time to be wishy-washy!
We're already there, anyway!

112
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,180
Let's go with "Ball"!

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,690
A-Alright! Guess I'll go with
Luffy's hunch on this one!

114
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,010
Then it's decided.
But don't let your guard down.

115
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,060
We're on God's Island,
10,000 meters up in the air!

116
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,380
Anything could happen here!

117
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,400
Let's go! Ball!

118
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,880
Hey, now! Don't shut your eyes, driver!

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Even when they're open, it's pitch black!

120
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,250
Say, there's other stuff like this, right?

121
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,340
Like what?

122
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,940
You know how there were four entrances?

123
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,690
Maybe one of them was the right one,
and the others were wrong?!

124
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,720
Eh?! What?! Don't say that now!

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
What happens if we chose the wrong one?!

126
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,870
If it's the wrong one... Hmm...

127
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,150
Maybe we'll fall off the sky island?

128
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,850
Don't be stupid! We can't fall off!

129
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,150
It's 10,000 meters to the Blue Sea, you know!

130
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,480
You could reflect on your life
multiple times on your way down!

131
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,760
Even falling has it limits!

132
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,630
Quit bein' idiots!

133
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,910
That's obviously not gonna happen--

134
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,340
No! You gotta be kidding me!

135
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,270
We're alive...

136
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,880
I seriously thought we were
gonna fall 10,000 meters...

137
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,480
It's all because you said
misleading stuff, Luffy!

138
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,840
That was scary! I thought I was gonna die!

139
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,760
Still, what is this place?

140
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,230
They're balls...

141
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,210
They're small "island cloud" balls...

142
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,300
Awesome! It's like big snow!

143
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,010
What a weird place! It's so neat!

144
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,880
The Milky Road leads above the trees...

145
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,890
But what part of this is an ordeal?

146
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,060
Who knows?

147
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,660
It'd be great if there's nothing at all,
but I doubt that's the case...

148
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,980
Maybe we got the right entrance?!

149
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,030
I bet if we chose the wrong one,
we'd be in trouble right about now!

150
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,280
Y-Yeah! You might be right!

151
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
Right?!

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,170
Idiots, don't let your guard down!

153
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,890
Would you really let criminals get off free?!

154
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,200
Give things some thought!

155
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,860
There might be traps like earlier...

156
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,460
Stay sharp!

157
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,540
Let's just keep moving...

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm thirsty! Let's have some tea!

159
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,460
Huh? Yes, let's! Open up
the rice crackers in your bag!

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,030
Ooh, good idea!

161
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,460
You guys!

162
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,450
C'mon, just one rice cracker!

163
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,890
Yeah! Let's eat, let's eat!

164
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,330
No! Listen! I'm gonna keep steering.

165
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,440
You guys keep watch on both sides!

166
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,780
It took us really high up at some point...!

167
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,260
But it's strange...

168
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,860
There are four priests,

169
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,110
so I assumed each entrance led to one...

170
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,570
...but I guess not.

171
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,240
Hey! Usopp! Pass!

172
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
Okay! I got it! Pass!

173
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,170
I told you to keep watch!

174
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,470
A snake!

175
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,300
You jerk! Get outta here!

176
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,970
That was a shock! Why...?!

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
Sanji! Look out! A cloud!

178
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,190
Kick it far away!

179
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,760
Dammit! Are all these
floating things snake eggs?!

180
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,590
This isn't good...

181
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,930
What's the deal with these balls?!

182
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,890
There's no telling what will come out!

183
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,690
These clouds are called "surprise clouds"!

184
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,060
Surprise clouds?!

185
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Heso!

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,330
Who're you?!

187
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,740
Thank you for choosing my "Ball Ordeal"!

188
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,950
"Skypiea Priest
Satori of the Forest"

189
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,890
Who is this dumpling freak?

190
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,810
Don't tell me he's a priest?!

191
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,600
You're the ball ordeal?! A ball?!

192
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,360
Quit dancin'! Who the hell are you?!

193
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,940
Wow, he seems dumber than I expected...

194
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,740
Didn't Nami and the old guy
say they were really strong?

195
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,710
Hey! Dumpling!

196
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,540
Nami-san and the others are safe, I hope?!

197
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,680
Do you mean the sacrifices?

198
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,290
If so, I wouldn't know.

199
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,560
Even if they're left alone, they're going to die!

200
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,390
Even if they manage to escape,
they're still going to die!

201
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,900
Say what?!

202
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,350
You should worry about yourselves.

203
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,440
Just so you know, you'll of course
need to beat me to continue ahead!

204
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,980
Okay! Here he comes, Luffy! Get 'im!

205
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,820
Alright! I'll shoot him down!

206
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,240
Gum-Gum...

207
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,820
Oh, you're going to stretch?

208
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,990
...Pistol!

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,150
No way!

210
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,010
Luffy!

211
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,980
Luffy?! Hey! You're alright, right?!

212
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,620
Regular hits don't work on you!

213
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,590
Hit?

214
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,530
It is a bit different from a hit!

215
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,010
I'll show you different!

216
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,870
An upper kick with the right foot...

217
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,370
Collier--! What?!

218
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,840
Only the well-trained are
given the power of "Mantra"!

219
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,710
Impossible! He predicted my movements?!

220
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Sanji!

221
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,910
It is different from a hit!

222
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,240
Impact!

223
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,620
The shock destroys the body from the inside!

224
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,680
D-Dammit! Sanji! Usopp!

225
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,200
Yeah, I'm alright...

226
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,070
But what the hell was that?!

227
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,510
No idea at all...! He's mysterious!

228
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,220
My name is Satori!

229
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,510
I am one of the priests of
the almighty God Eneru!

230
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,150
I own the Vearth in this Illusion Forest!

231
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,980
Illusion Forest?

232
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,940
Yes!

233
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,810
This forest!

234
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,910
And...

235
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,820
...your boat will be lost in its illusions!

236
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,920
The boat is taking off!

237
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,260
Your boat will now speed along
this forest's Milky Road at random

238
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,080
and eventually leave through
this forest's only exit!

239
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,730
I'm sure you realize it, but losing a dial boat

240
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,440
is the same as losing your
way to the sacrificial altar.

241
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
So you must find and board
the boat before that happens.

242
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,380
Of course, these countless surprise
clouds and I will not allow that.

243
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,710
Welcome to the sacred ground of Upper Yard!

244
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,410
This is the Illusion Forest Ball Ordeal,
with a 10% survival rate!

245
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,170
10% survival rate?!

246
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,570
Zoro! Nami! Robin!

247
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,190
Don't leave me all alone!

248
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,090
Please come back!

249
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,980
Who'll save me if I'm suddenly attacked now?!

250
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,620
This is all because Luffy wanted
to go to the sky island...

251
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm sure Luffy and the others
are headed here in search of us.

252
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,980
Oh, yeah! Luffy and the others are coming!

253
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,770
Oh! Then I just need to endure it until then!

254
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,490
I just need to play it safe and
wait for Luffy and the others!

255
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,480
In the meantime, I'll fix the ship!
Zoro did ask me to!

256
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,880
Alright!

257
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,790
When Luffy and the others find out
I'm handling the ship fine alone...

258
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,310
The hammer!

259
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,940
I-I have to go get it...

260
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,280
But...

261
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,380
You'd better hurry before the boat
goes deeper into the Illusion Forest!

262
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,580
Hey! We gotta go after the boat
before we lose sight of it!

263
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,410
If we lose it in this forest,
finding it again'll be tough!

264
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,510
Wait, Usopp! The same is
true if we get separated!

265
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,080
Luffy! What about you?!

266
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,930
You guys stop the boat!

267
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,340
I'm gonna take care of the ball guy!

268
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,400
In your dreams! I'm filled
with good fortune and pride!

269
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,810
I guess we do need someone
to stop that potbelly freak!

270
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,830
Don't do anything reckless!
He's got some weird powers!

271
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,150
We'll come back once we stop the boat!

272
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,050
Right!

273
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,450
Hold it right there, Ball!

274
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,920
Grabs a branch...

275
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,250
Gum-Gum...

276
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,540
The same as before.

277
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,930
...Pistol!

278
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,160
What's wrong? I thought you
were going to take care of me?

279
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,530
I said I will... and I will!

280
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,370
I won't miss this time! Gum-Gum...

281
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,080
A fake punch, followed by a kick...

282
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,460
...Whip!

283
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,590
Again!

284
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,890
Gum-Gum...

285
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,260
Where is it?! Where'd the Crow go?!

286
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,610
We gotta catch the boat, quick!

287
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,910
Dammit! Can't see from down here!

288
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,050
Alright!

289
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,700
Watch yourself, Luffy!
These priests are no ordinary people!

290
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,660
Let's find the boat ASAP
and get the hell outta here!

291
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,460
U-Urgh... I-I'm stuck...!

292
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,430
How stubborn.

293
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:22,360
Even if we're far apart

294
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,820
I don't want you to forget

295
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:38,310
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

296
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,000
You have a friend here to share the pain

297
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,560
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

298
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:59,150
I won't let it just be a dream

299
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,820
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

300
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:13,050
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

301
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,350
Crap! At this rate, we're gonna lose the boat!

302
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,890
What are these surprise
clouds and this ball guy?!

303
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,750
Sky fights are strange!

304
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,090
This is no time for crappy ordeals!

305
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,390
We gotta save Nami-san and Robin-chan!

306
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,030
Zoro! Nami! Robin!

307
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,860
On the next episode of One Piece!

308
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,180
"The Ordeal of Spheres!
Desperate Struggle in the Lost Forest"

309
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
