2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,630
After the Straw Hat crew
rescued the mermaid Camie,

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,080
they met Rayleigh, the craftsman they
were looking for, at the auction house.

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,660
Roger turned himself in.

53
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,750
I'm not going to die, partner...

54
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,030
My treasure?

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,000
If you want it, you can have it!

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Find it!

57
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

58
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,510
Do you think you can do it?

59
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,610
The Grand Line still far surpasses
anything you can imagine!

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,990
Your foes will be powerful, too.

61
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,230
Can you rule this mighty sea?!

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm not gonna rule anything!

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,190
It's the freest person in this sea
who's the King of the Pirates!

64
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,070
I see...

65
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,040
"No Escape!?
Admiral Kizaru's Light Speed Kick!!"

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,590
Take care!

67
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,340
Don't do anything crazy!

68
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah! Same to you guys!

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,940
Say bye to Hachi for us, too!

70
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,620
How over-the-top. We're going to
see them again in three days...

71
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,890
It's always sad to say goodbye.

72
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,420
See you later!

73
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,780
Well, then. I should be off, too.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,820
Okay! We're counting on you!

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,180
Still, it was a real shock
to run into a member

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,370
of the Pirate King's crew
in a place like this.

77
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,130
He's a real intimidating guy,
for an old geezer.

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,630
Well, he is the most
renowned man in Roger's crew!

79
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,150
So that's what crewmen on
the Oro Jackson were like...

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,370
I am boomingly proud of the fact
that I helped the man named Roger!

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm glad to have met him!

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,640
I didn't know you were the type
to respect your superiors...!

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,750
W-Well, sometimes I do!

84
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,840
Hey.

85
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,770
Wanna go to the amusement park?!

86
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,170
Shut up, you!

87
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,400
Do you even understand the situation?!

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,630
You still haven't learned your lesson?!

89
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,100
I want to go...!

90
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,640
Not you guys, too!

91
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,390
It's Admiral Kizaru!
The only thing to do now is run!

92
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,720
Get the pirates!

93
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,570
Hello?

94
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,080
There are wanted men everywhere!

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,770
Watch out for the ones
worth over 100 million!

96
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,350
--Run!
--Run!

97
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:37,910
Hello? This is Kizaru. Hmm? How odd...

98
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,500
"Navy Headquarters Admiral --
Kizaru (Real Name: Borsalino)"

99
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,200
Hello?

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,480
That's odd...

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,630
Th-This is really bad!

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Th-There's still a slight chance!

103
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,970
If by some luck I can take him down,
I'll suddenly become famous!

104
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,260
Huh?! Don't be an idiot!

105
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,640
This is the navy's greatest
military force we're talking about!

106
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,950
Hello? Do you read me?

107
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,020
--Now! Take this!
--S-Stop...!

108
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,000
Hello?

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,870
Hello?

110
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,990
--H-Hey!
--Damn! I'll get you this time!

111
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,080
Huh?! What the...?!
I definitely hit him that time!

112
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,510
It went right through his head, right?!

113
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,390
How odd...

114
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,030
He's obviously got some kind of powers!

115
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,320
Guns ain't gonna work on him! Let's run!

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,190
Say, I was wondering if you could help me...

117
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,530
I'm looking for a man named Sentomaru...

118
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,610
He's a subordinate of mine, you see...

119
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,380
Sheesh. All I did was ask a question...

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,960
Uhh, I think Kizaru-san is
going a bit overboard...

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,180
He knows better than to break
the Hustle Muscle Mangroves!

122
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,810
I think I might've overdone things a tad...

123
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,460
Talk about crazy...

124
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,230
So that's Admiral Kizaru, huh?

125
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,920
Apoo-san! We're in danger, too!
We should really get out of here!

126
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,960
You're such a fool.

127
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,900
Where's the fun in slinking away?

128
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,590
Nothing beats running away
after making an enemy mad...

129
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,150
What are you planning to do?!

130
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,530
Come on! Pick up the pace!

131
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,240
A lot got away...

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,940
Yeah.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,170
Requesting backup at the harbor!

134
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,550
What's happening?!

135
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,850
I don't know!

136
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,830
I don't know why,

137
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,000
but all the soldiers have
turned into kids or old people!

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,300
What's going on?!

139
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,260
Oh... My aching back...!

140
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,450
A masterpiece!

141
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,820
It was her doing!

142
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,470
It was Jewelry Bonney!
She has a bounty of 140 million!

143
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,250
Which one do you prefer?

144
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,470
What happened?!

145
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,070
Hello?! Respond!

146
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,310
Watch out for the rookies
worth over 100 million!

147
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,230
I repeat, watch out for the
rookies worth over 100 million!

148
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,140
You're Capone Gang Bege,
worth 138 million, aren't you?!

149
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,470
You can just forget about setting sail!

150
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,310
Where's your crew?! Gone off on their own?!

151
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,870
You're one unlucky bastard! Give yourself up!

152
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,870
In terms of troop strength, you lose!

153
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,140
What's this commotion?!

154
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,220
Captain Hawkins!

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
There is no need to hurry.

156
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,750
Fate has already been decided.

157
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,020
Say, I was wondering if you could help me...

158
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
K-Kizaru?!

159
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,860
--W-We'll keep him busy here!
--Please escape, Captain!

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,030
Don't panic. I will not die today.

161
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,130
How do you like that?! You're charred black!

162
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,080
Get back, Kid Pirates!

163
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,370
Oww! So hard!

164
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,200
Room.

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,420
Shambles!

166
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,700
I got you now!

167
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,320
Oww! Huh?

168
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,260
How irritating!

169
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,550
How about this, then?!

170
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,570
Troublesome bastard...

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,450
It's not over yet, Eustass-ya!

172
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,320
Looks like you still
haven't had enough of me!

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,890
I'm telling you, we should
hide in the amusement park!

174
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,000
Liar.

175
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,550
You just wanna go and have fun!

176
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,980
It can't be!

177
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,240
Who're you?!

178
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,250
Enemy attack!

179
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,700
Hurry it up!

180
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,170
Commence attack! Cannons, ready!

181
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,430
Open the gunports!

182
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,550
Commence bombardment!

183
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,600
What?!

184
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
Fire!

185
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,640
What the...?!

186
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,800
There's stuff inside his body!

187
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,900
It turned big--!

188
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,550
What's going on?!

189
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,440
He didn't do anything himself!

190
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,780
Cavalry! Charge!

191
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,130
Something else is coming
out of his stomach now!

192
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,090
Troops keep coming out!

193
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,550
I-It's horses this time!

194
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,260
Capone Gang Bege!

195
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,130
What the hell power does that guy have?!

196
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,660
Firing squad! Aim!

197
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,520
What's this smoke?!

198
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,570
Father! There's too much smoke!

199
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,990
I told you you don't have
enough troop strength!

200
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,580
Get outta here! Hurry!

201
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,900
I still haven't eaten enough...

202
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm sure there'll be good food
on the next island, too!

203
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,850
Hey! Did you hear?!

204
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,990
A Warlord of the Sea has joined the attack!

205
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,060
Are you serious?! Who is it?!

206
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,600
A Warlord?!

207
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,730
I was fully expecting an admiral...!

208
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,470
I guess quietly passing by Navy
Headquarters is out of the question.

209
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,330
But...

210
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,250
...I have my pride to think of, too!

211
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,220
Please, just escape, Captain Hawkins!

212
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,930
Captain Hawkins!

213
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,480
Combat: Chance of Defeat: 100%.

214
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,480
Say, can you help me?

215
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,670
Escape: Chance of Success: 12%.

216
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm looking for a man named Sentomaru...

217
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,570
Defense: Chance of Evasion: 76%.

218
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,490
Hey...

219
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,400
I know no such man.

220
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,570
Ask someone else.

221
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,140
Well, actually, if I can't find him,
then that leaves me with spare time...

222
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,710
And if I'm not busy,
I obviously can't let a wanted man go...

223
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,340
Especially one like you,
with a 249 million bounty...

224
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,350
..."Magician" Basil Hawkins!

225
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,060
Speed is weight!

226
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,020
Have you ever been
kicked at the speed of light?

227
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,700
Captain!

228
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,970
We're ready to set sail!

229
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,330
Alright! Let's scram!

230
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,120
Wh-What happened?!

231
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,380
H-Hey! What happened?!

232
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,260
I don't know! He suddenly went flying!

233
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,030
This guy's strong, all right...

234
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,640
Whoa! He's still going!

235
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,800
H-Hey! What happened?! He just suddenly--!

236
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,610
Where'd the attack come from?!

237
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,010
Captain!

238
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,810
Impressive. You far surpass what I imagined.

239
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,310
That's odd...

240
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,270
To think two would be destroyed already...

241
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,390
Against an admiral,
ten isn't enough to feel secure.

242
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,530
That's "Mad Monk" Urouge!

243
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,500
That's not all!

244
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,370
That's Bartholomew Kuma,
one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

245
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm at a loss! What strength!

246
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,410
There's an even stronger foe to worry about.

247
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,170
You can't be serious! That's Kizaru!

248
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,480
What tragic fate!

249
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,760
A navy admiral ahead, and a Warlord behind!

250
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,930
Is this the end of the line?!

251
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,770
Not necessarily. I do not yet see
the shadow of death upon you.

252
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,130
You don't say...

253
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,420
Hawkins, of North Blue, huh?

254
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,240
Thank you for the joke, foe as you may be!

255
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,180
What the...?!

256
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,910
Someone else has joined the fight!

257
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,530
That's...

258
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,300
"Red Flag" X. Drake!

259
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,170
Why is he here?!

260
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,930
Is that the extent of your power, Mad Monk?!

261
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,610
You, again?!

262
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,380
Rear Admiral Drake.

263
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,590
Crap! I hadn't planned
on running into Kizaru!

264
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,100
I've taken quite a beating,

265
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,790
but let's find out now if
I really have any hope left or not!

266
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,960
I think I'll start with
a small counterattack.

267
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,930
Look! Things are really crazy now!

268
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,620
This is great stuff!

269
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,130
This is really dangerous!
They're all going to die!

270
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,500
This is our chance to escape!

271
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,970
Are you crazy?
The real fun is just about to begin!

272
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,730
Who're you?!

273
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,020
--Get back, Luffy!
--He's one of the Warlords of the Sea!

274
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,690
A Warlord?! How come you guys know that?!

275
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,500
Don't let that attack hit you!
It's a shockwave!

276
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,420
What is this?!

277
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,540
He can do this, too?!

278
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,630
Hey! You lied about it being a shockwave!

279
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,430
That was...

280
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,960
...a beam!

281
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,130
This is no time to be excited, you morons!

282
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,050
Bartholomew Kuma! Why are you back?!

283
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,640
That bastard...!

284
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,900
Wait, is he the guy you said
showed up on Thriller Bark afterward?!

285
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,750
Yeah, that's him!

286
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,330
Things got real bad when he hit us with
shockwaves from the paws on his palms!

287
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,960
He had planned to wipe us out there...

288
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,090
...so he must've come back
when he found out we survived!

289
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,560
You gave us plenty of trouble back then!

290
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,900
Coup de Vent!

291
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,750
Did that work?!

292
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,030
No, the guy's still right as rain...!

293
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,120
Luffy-san!

294
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,830
Second Gear!

295
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,540
We know he's strong,
so let's go all-out at the very start!

296
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,090
Guess we have no choice!

297
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,210
Something's off here...
He seems different from last time.

298
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,110
Is it just my imagination?!

299
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,370
Let's go!

300
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,730
What's taking so long?!
The warship should have arrived already!

301
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,170
How odd...

302
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,480
Why hasn't Uncle Kizaru contacted me yet?!

303
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,110
He better hurry.

304
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,680
They're going to...

305
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,440
...get rid of all the rookies!

306
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Is he that different from the Warlord
of the Sea that we met before?

307
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,460
Yeah. The real one would've
teleported and dodged our attacks.

308
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,900
So he's a fake?

309
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,150
But that's the real problem.

310
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,850
That'd mean there are two
guys who're this strong.

311
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,360
On the next episode of One Piece!

312
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,090
"Overwhelming!
The Navy's Fighting Weapons, the Pacifistas"

313
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
