2
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,240
That was close...

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Th-Thanks...

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,800
Look at that. That big schedule
board got torn apart by a wave.

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,180
What's with the power of this ebbing?

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,150
The speed of the waves of
this Aqua Laguna are abnormal.

7
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,070
Is that right?! So Sanji went
to the station after that?

8
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,650
Yep!

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,000
So, anyway, no matter what means
we take to follow the sea train,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,280
we can't do anything unless
we find Luffy and Zoro first.

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,240
Okay, got it!

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,950
Everyone, please help us out!

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,690
Guys! We're counting on you!

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,130
Yeah!

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,990
Jerry... Aurora Flicker... Jab!

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,300
Drop Kick!

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,550
This is a waste of time.

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,140
Brochette!

19
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,940
Where are you, Straw Hat?!

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,230
Answer us!

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,520
Hey! Look! Look!

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,700
Hmm...

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,430
Ah! Pirate lady! Hey, look over there!
There's something there!

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,580
Something?

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,000
Luffy...

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,380
Hm? That straw hat...

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,840
Isn't that your King of the Pirates?

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,850
Right?

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,500
That idiot!

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,810
Hey! Where are you going?!

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,230
Don't go down to the backstreets!

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,410
Do you wanna lose your life?!

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,680
Aqua Laguna is already coming! Come back!

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,160
This is crazy! The pirate
woman went down the stairs!

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,120
Hey! Come back! Don't go down there!

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,870
--Wait!
--Don't go to the backstreets!

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,710
Don't follow her!

38
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,580
Paulie-san!

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,090
It's not like all of you going
is enough to save her!

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,170
But...!

41
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,420
It's the sea we're up against!
You'll just end up sharing her fate!

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,010
If something happens,
I will handle things myself.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,060
You guys just stay back!

44
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,330
She jumped off to the backstreets!

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,050
Boy, she makes me nervous.

46
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,430
So, she's headed for Straw Hat?

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,240
It's all right! Now let's move forward

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,660
with the sun always in our hearts

49
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,620
let's grab hold of our wishes

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:05,720
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,940
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

53
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,900
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

54
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,990
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

55
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,640
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,370
but what you cherish most will be right there

57
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,380
And if you get into a jam

58
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,380
I'll always be there to protect you

59
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,630
It's all right! Now let's move forward

60
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,140
with the sun always in our hearts

61
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,410
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

62
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,650
and gaze at the light beyond

63
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,360
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,650
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

65
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,070
So let's grab hold of our wishes

66
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,490
under the same flag-- together, we're one

67
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,000
One Piece

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,970
"Nami's Soul Cries Out!
Straw Hat Luffy Makes a Comeback!"

69
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,640
It's unbelievable that she
can run someplace like that.

70
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,150
She's really something else!

71
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,270
Idiots! This is no time to be impressed!

72
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,670
Hey! Come back right away!

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,730
You'll be swallowed by the sea!

74
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,770
A sea anemone...

75
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,870
A sea anemone...

76
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,330
A sea anemone is coming out
of a chimney. Why a sea anemone?

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,260
A sea anemone?

78
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,440
Ah...! Hey, wait, reindeer! Not you, too!

79
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,560
Zoro!

80
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,150
Nico Robin made a deal with
CP9 by giving up everything...

81
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,800
...for a wish that couldn't come
true if she was with you guys.

82
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,900
That the six Straw Hats, excluding me,
can leave this island safely!

83
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,600
For that, I don't care if the weapon is
brought back or the world is destroyed.

84
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,510
Robin! Wait! We'll fight for you
no matter who we're up against!

85
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,400
Robin!

86
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,480
Pirate lady! You're so amazing!

87
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,520
How foolish!

88
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,850
You won't make it back in time!

89
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,090
Just look offshore! The wave
is almost here already!

90
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,290
Oh, shoot! They're gonna die!

91
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,700
They can't make it back anymore!

92
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,350
Zoro! Zoro! Can you hear me?! It's me!

93
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,550
Chopper?

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,850
This is it. I can't go any further.

95
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,230
Luffy!

96
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,780
What the hell are you doing there?!

97
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,780
N... Nami! Are you there behind me?!

98
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,640
Well, hey, listen!

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,030
At any rate, that pigeon guy sent me flying

100
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,340
and I flew right into this gap.

101
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,600
Don't fool around at a critical time like this!

102
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,320
While you've been taking your
sweet time, Robin was taken away!

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,350
Robin intends to die for us!

104
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,640
She sacrificed herself in order to protect
us from an attack by the Government!

105
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,650
There's no place for me to go or go back to.

106
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,780
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

107
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,240
When she knew that she was going
to be killed if she was taken in!

108
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,990
Then...

109
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,160
...after all, Robin was...

110
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,960
...lying?

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,340
Yes!

112
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,510
Good...

113
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,470
Don't worry!

114
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,310
I'm not gonna let Robin die!

115
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,280
Look at that wave!

116
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,270
What the hell is that? It really is
several times bigger than usual!

117
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,090
Hey! This is seriously bad!

118
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,160
Pirate woman! Give up and run already!

119
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,620
Reindeer!

120
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,360
Ow! I'm being torn apart!

121
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
You aren't coming out!
How'd you get in there, Zoro?!

122
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,790
Owwww! Don't pull me!

123
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,310
What're we gonna do?!
The huge wave is almost here already!

124
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,700
"What're we gonna do"? How should I know?

125
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,070
Hm? Wait a sec. Are you carrying
the Kitetsu by any chance?

126
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,650
What? One of your swords?
Yes, I am. How'd you know?

127
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,900
For just that one, I can tell,
since it's a cursed sword.

128
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,530
So you were carrying it
for me, Chopper? Thanks.

129
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,120
Let me hold it in my hand! Hurry up!

130
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,940
Hurry up and run!

131
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,170
Climb up to a high place! Go to a higher place!

132
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,950
Oh, no, this is it! They're not gonna make it!

133
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,420
Pirate woman!

134
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,840
You're gonna be swallowed!

135
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,110
Aqua Laguna is here!

136
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,100
What is this...?

137
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,790
Goodbye.

138
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,860
Aqua Laguna is already so close!

139
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,830
What is this?

140
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,340
This is it!

141
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,120
Ahhh! What the hell?! He broke the buildings!

142
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,170
Zoro!

143
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,380
Stay back, Chopper!

144
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,050
One-Sword Style! Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

145
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,980
Ahh! What the hell are they?!

146
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,400
Here we go, Nami!

147
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,070
What the hell is this?

148
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,280
Rumble! Jumping Point!

149
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,370
Hold on to me, Zoro!

150
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,670
Ahh... The backstreets are...!

151
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,260
Dammit!

152
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,230
Hey, look at that! It's them!

153
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,960
Wow! You did it!

154
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,420
They'll be safe, since they
got to the Great Bridge.

155
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,760
As big as the wave may be, it can't reach there.

156
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,180
You guys're amazing!

157
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,840
Good going, you guys!

158
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,580
Ahh! It's come this far!

159
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,280
What happened to the Straw Hats?!

160
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Did they get swallowed by Aqua Laguna?!

161
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,660
No, look at that!

162
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,720
Paulie-san!

163
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,640
Dammit!

164
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,580
We're not safe yet! Run!
Run to the shipbuilding island!

165
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,100
Hurry!

166
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,920
The Great Bridge is gonna collapse!

167
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,170
What a wave...

168
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,860
Yeah... Unbelievable...
This is the shipbuilding island!

169
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,130
Even staying here doesn't seem safe.

170
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,630
Look! The tide is ebbing again.

171
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,630
It's just natural. It'll keep coming back.

172
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,800
The second wave... The third wave...
Just like the one we just saw!

173
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,730
Let us evacuate to a higher place, too!

174
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,450
Seriously... That was reckless!

175
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,260
Thanks. You saved us, rope guy.

176
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,200
I was shocked! So that's Aqua Laguna...

177
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
I still can't stop shaking.

178
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,670
If a big one like that had hit us every year,

179
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,040
this island would be long gone.

180
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,670
This year's Aqua Laguna is different.

181
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,630
You guys are really crazy.
I'm surprised you survived.

182
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,340
Ah! Monster Granny.
So you were on this island?

183
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,850
Of course! If we stayed in the middle
of the sea like that, we'd drown!

184
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Ah! Pirate guy!
You were incredible! Like, wham!

185
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,680
Yeah, I know.

186
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,950
Are you trying to suffocate me?!

187
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,370
This idiot lost consciousness
while holding on to me.

188
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,910
Oh...? Come to think of it, Zoro,

189
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,460
why were you also being chased by the wave?

190
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,920
Were you in the lower side of town?

191
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,210
What? W-Well, not particularly...

192
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,390
He was stuck in a chimney.

193
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,800
Stuck in a chimney?

194
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,180
You're so clumsy, Zoro!
What'd you have to do to be in that situ...

195
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,150
Are you in any position to be laughing
at others?! You both are super clumsy!

196
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,780
Ah... Then what happened to
Sanji and Uso... I mean, Sanji?

197
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,780
Yeah... There're lots of things I need
to tell you. You listen, too, Zoro.

198
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,620
Hm?

199
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,250
This is my big chance.

200
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,840
With Buster Call, we can urgently summon

201
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,430
five of the Navy Headquarters'
vice admirals as well as ten battleships.

202
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:12,640
This is thanks to Aokiji for giving us,
CP9, the authority to exercise it.

203
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,890
Don't you think, Funkfreed?

204
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,390
Nico Robin, the woman whom the World
Government has been pursuing for 20 years,

205
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,160
has fallen straight into the hands of us, CP9.

206
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,870
At the same time, along with her,
we're taking in that detestable Cutty Flam,

207
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,920
that disciple of Tom's who
has the blueprints for Pluton.

208
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:41,230
Only two people hold the key to
the ancient weapon in this vast world.

209
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,910
And these two are on the sea train
headed to me right now...

210
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,100
The military force strong enough to
destroy the world is headed to me.

211
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,160
Now then...

212
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,330
Just wait, Robin-chan!

213
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,130
Your prince on a white horse is coming now!

214
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,170
Are you saying that Nico Robin
sacrificed herself for us?

215
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,840
That's right.

216
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,810
And the cook and Usopp are on the same train?

217
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,270
What do you wanna do, Captain?

218
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,480
There's nothing to think about.

219
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,610
Let's sail out right away and follow them!

220
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,040
There's no other way.

221
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,010
We're off... to rescue Robin!

222
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,270
We had a dream that day

223
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,130
Our belief in ourselves

224
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:47,170
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

225
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:56,720
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

226
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:06,900
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

227
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:15,450
In the end, we can all surely smile

228
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,920
Hey! Let us borrow a ship!
A strong and fast one!

229
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,050
No. You can't make it through this storm.

230
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,140
Even if you leave now,
there's no chance you'd survive!

231
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,380
It doesn't matter!
Our friends are waiting for us!

232
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,650
There's one way-- just one way--
to get through this Aqua Laguna.

233
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,140
On the next episode of One Piece!

234
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,300
"Another Sea Train? Rocketman Charges Forth!"

235
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
