00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,970
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,260
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,910
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,880
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,520
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,430
What's that?

35
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,310
Don't...

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,320
...die!

37
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,120
Is Nami-san okay?

38
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,170
You guys are as tough as ever.

39
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,460
I'm glad you're alive!

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,800
Ahhh! So it was real!
Mermaids really don't exist!

41
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,280
So the tales were true about
people seeing a mermaid

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,300
then realizing it was actually a dugong!

43
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,530
You morons! She still hasn't
said she's a mermaid yet!

44
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,890
Don't give up on the dream yet!

45
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,870
I'm an icefish mermaid.

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,270
Stop it! Don't say "icefish"!

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,820
Dammit!

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,530
Dammit!

49
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,480
It's a cannon attack!

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,580
Bro!

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,140
At the front gate, we identified about
fifty pirates, including the giants.

52
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
Those guys...!

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,940
That's Zambai and the others!
See, I told you! They escaped the island okay!

54
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,060
I wasn't worried about them at all!

55
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,030
Really, they wouldn't die
even if you killed them!

56
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,170
The other day, too...

57
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,060
We have finished eliminating them
with a barrage of cannon fire.

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,540
All are dead.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,370
Under the circumstances, no one could
possibly survive on the main island.

60
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,210
Hence, the number of survivors on
Enies Lobby's main island is zero!

61
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Is it really okay...

62
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,800
...for people to die so easily like this?

63
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,110
You can't see people on the map.

64
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:58,770
They just erase a small island from the
world map, without a shred of emotion.

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,070
That's what Buster Call is.

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,020
Hurry up! Straw Hat!

67
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,580
Your friends are waiting for you here!

68
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,040
Don't you dare die on us!

69
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,920
This will be the last time!

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,770
Until I bring you down, I won't stop it.

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,650
Are you gonna try to use up
all your power and die?

72
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,350
I don't know what's gonna happen.

73
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,070
Second... Gear!

74
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,590
"Wait for Luffy! Mortal Combat
on the Bridge of Hesitation!"

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,930
Luffy...

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,890
Hurry up and get here!

77
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,010
Gum-Gum...

78
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,010
...Jet Pistol!

79
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,730
He jumped backwards to reduce the impact!

80
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,560
Moon Walk!

81
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,970
Finger Pistol!

82
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,620
Jet Bullet!

83
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,250
Twin Jet Pistol!

84
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,050
Gum-Gum...

85
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,510
I'll show you...

86
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,760
...my strongest technique, one that
pushes the Six Powers to their limit!

87
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,270
Six Powers Secret Technique!

88
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,360
Six King Gun!

89
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,510
It's like... the Impact Dial from the sky island...

90
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,950
But it's several times more
powerful than the Impact Dial...

91
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,100
Tempest Kick! Victory Bird!

92
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,000
Luffy...!

93
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,900
Lucci is strong.

94
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,750
If Straw Hat hadn't kept him
restrained in that place,

95
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,290
I don't know how many of us
would've died, to be honest.

96
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,790
You know, I sometimes feel...

97
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,420
...that Luffy always seems to know
whom he has to fight from the start.

98
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,970
I'm definitely gonna beat up the pigeon guy.

99
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,680
He just has animal instincts...
even better than yours.

100
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,470
I have a report, sir!

101
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,360
Straw Hat Luffy is in the first column!

102
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,820
So he's alive...

103
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,950
Tell all ships to take up positions
around the Bridge of Hesitation!

104
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,620
--Yes, sir!
--Let's go! Hurry up!

105
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,540
He won't... die, right?

106
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,540
Are you an idiot?

107
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,470
What'd you say?!

108
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,450
Only an idiot calls others idiots!

109
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,230
What's going on?

110
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,940
The wall is...

111
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,000
The first column is now cut off!

112
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,580
They destroyed half of the bridge!

113
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,340
Why did they do that?!

114
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,300
Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9 and Straw Hat
Luffy are in the first column!

115
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,990
The battleships are coming this way!

116
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,010
All ships! Take up positions
around the Bridge of Hesitation!

117
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,970
On the bridge and the escort ship,

118
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,240
we've identified nine pirates,
including pirate hunter Zoro and Nico Robin!

119
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,700
It appears that they're the main force
that defeated CP9 in the Tower of Law!

120
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,080
They're coming to take Robin again.

121
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,420
We're not gonna let them!

122
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,100
At any rate, they're unbelievable.

123
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,310
The 800-year-old legend of the
impregnability of Enies Lobby

124
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,390
came about due to the reign
of many generations of CP9.

125
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,950
And yet, to think that a pirate
group defeated its members

126
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,940
and their captain is vying with
Mr. Rob Lucci, of all people...

127
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,860
It seems that Straw Hat Luffy
wasn't a mere rookie.

128
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,970
But he can't defeat Mr. Lucci.

129
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,100
And it's very clear that their
group will be annihilated here.

130
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,870
This is the end of the road for those villains.

131
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,620
Hey, look over there!

132
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,510
Luffy-kun!

133
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,800
We're here!

134
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,270
We all got to the bridge safely!

135
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,530
We're okay!

136
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,510
You don't have to worry about us, Luffy-kun!

137
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,490
We rescued Robin-chan, too!

138
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,630
All that's left is for you to defeat him!

139
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,080
Defeat him, Luffy!

140
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,490
We'll all make it through this...

141
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,960
...and leave this place!

142
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,680
Now it's just a matter of how
long we can hold them off.

143
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,900
As you said, they're all still alive.
That's incredible.

144
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,980
But we'll see if you can still keep
that face a few minutes later.

145
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,370
Evil cannot thrive in this world!

146
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,950
Those ranked Lieutenant
Commander or below, stay put!

147
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,790
To the two hundred elite Captains and
Commanders, go take them out quickly!

148
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,430
C-Captains from Headquarters?!

149
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,470
They're in the same class as that smoke freak!

150
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,930
We're facing that many guys of that level?!

151
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,390
That's proof that they're scared of us.

152
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,430
Grandma, I'm scared.

153
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,260
Hm? Where's Sanji?

154
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,620
He was right there just a moment ago.

155
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,830
What? Where'd that idiot
cook go at a time like this?

156
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,750
All hands prepare for battle! Let's go!

157
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,920
Yeah!

158
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,830
Enough talking--bring it on already!

159
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,400
Interesting. I'll go wild one more time.

160
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,320
We'll stand our ground here
with everything we've got!

161
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,280
Hold your ground until
Luffy comes, at any cost!

162
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,030
We have to get off the ship! If they hurt
the ship, we won't be able to escape!

163
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,530
I'll never get caught again!

164
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,370
I can't... move!

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
Get them!

166
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,970
Those ranked Lieutenant
Commander or below, stay put!

167
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,440
To the two hundred elite Captains and
Commanders, go take them out quickly!

168
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,530
Get them!

169
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,450
Recapture Nico Robin!

170
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,290
We've come this far! We're not
gonna let them take her back!

171
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,480
Two hundred elites from
Navy Headquarters... Fine by me!

172
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,540
But there are so many of them!

173
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,420
Weapons...

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,960
...Left!

175
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,760
Dealing with one or two at a time is too
much of a pain. Attack me all at once!

176
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,850
Experience the power of Sogeking!

177
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,190
Sunflower Star!

178
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,320
So you want me to fight
with guns and cannons?!

179
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,580
Take this!

180
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,790
Those things won't work on me! Weapons Left!

181
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,970
I won't let you get away! Strong Right!

182
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,400
Hey! Whoa! Hey! Time out! Time out!

183
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,150
Y-You bastard! If you're using a sword,
go to Zoro! Go to Zoro!

184
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,200
That's how it should be, right?!

185
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,240
Ah...!

186
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,580
What's that?!

187
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,410
Gunpowder Star!

188
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,170
All right! My feint strategy was a success!

189
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,540
Hey... What the heck is this?!

190
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,260
I almost fell off!

191
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,130
"Phew"

192
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,130
That was close!

193
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,470
At any rate, more and more
keep crawling out... What a pain!

194
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,470
Isn't there someone here with some backbone?!

195
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,890
Don't think you can defeat me just
by attacking me in large numbers!

196
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,560
Oh?

197
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,190
A broadax? How daring.

198
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,190
I like it.

199
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,410
What's the matter?!

200
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,620
Just swinging that thing around
powerfully isn't enough to defeat me.

201
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,670
Three-Sword Style... Oni... Giri!

202
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,530
Not again! Like I said, instead of
coming to me, go to Zoro! Go to Zoro!

203
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,570
Good job, Zoro-kun!

204
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,530
Sogeking! Duck!

205
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,120
Nice, Zoro-kun!

206
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,840
Grandma! The Navy's coming here, too!

207
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,010
That's not good.

208
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,970
Robin, stay here. I'll hold them back!

209
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,390
Here I come! Thunder Charge!

210
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,230
Swing Arm!

211
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,380
Thunder Ball!

212
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,830
--What's this?!
--Clouds?!

213
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,500
Thunderbolt Tempo!

214
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
I did it!

215
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
How dare you fight us
with that joke of a weapon?!

216
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,720
You pirate bitch!

217
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,600
Robin...!

218
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,570
I'm part of the Straw Hats, too.
When we fight, we fight together.

219
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,200
Gah! There's more?!

220
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,030
Hello! We're hostages!

221
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,650
We're weak!

222
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,810
Hold strong until Luffy comes!

223
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,250
Shave!

224
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,040
What's the matter?

225
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,960
It seems to me that doping
technique of yours is losing its edge.

226
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,800
It's pointless to struggle!

227
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,840
You guys won't be able to
get past Enies Lobby after all!

228
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,300
That's just reality!

229
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,720
Gum-Gum... Jet Axe!

230
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,390
Even if this island gets
destroyed in the process...

231
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,780
...I'll pursue that woman who
threatens the World Government's plans

232
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,110
to the very ends of the
earth and eliminate her...

233
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,650
...in the name of dark justice!

234
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,110
We came to take Robin away from all that!

235
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,080
Jet Stamp!

236
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,080
Six King Gun!

237
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,890
Luffy!

238
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,670
--I got him!
--Watch out!

239
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,720
Hey! Now's not the time
to be spacing out, Soge...

240
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,000
Luffy!

241
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,720
They're all alive!

242
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,060
All I have to do now is beat up
this guy... The pigeon guy!

243
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,360
We're gonna go back together, Robin!

244
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

245
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,110
"Fists Full of Emotion!
Luffy Unleashes Gatling with All His Might"

246
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
