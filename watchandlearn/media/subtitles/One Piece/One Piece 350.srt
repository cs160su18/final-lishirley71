2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,000
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,730
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,350
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,560
Hit him with the light!

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,360
What the heck are you doing?!

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,070
Jerk, I'll get you for this!

50
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,800
What is that?! My shadow?

51
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,180
Hey, don't do it!

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,530
I've obtained 300 million
Berries' worth of might!

53
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,000
Now I can complete the greatest
Special Zombie in history!

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,270
"The Warrior Known as the 'Devil'!!
The Moment of Oars' Revival!"

55
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,880
Now Straw Hat Luffy belongs to me!

56
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,960
At last! I've finally obtained
the ultimate subordinate!

57
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,580
L-Luffy...!

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,630
What just happened? Did you see that?

59
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,390
That's his shadow! He cut off Luffy's shadow...

60
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,660
His shadow...? Didn't that skeleton,
Brook, mention something like that?

61
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,440
He stole Luffy's shadow?
Is he the one who took Brook's?

62
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,620
I can't believe it... How did he do that?

63
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,100
Hey, Kumacy! You were mumbling
something again, weren't you?

64
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,080
Didn't I tell you to zip it?

65
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,620
Get it through your head!
I'm tired of repeating myself!

66
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,470
You're not cute when you talk, so don't talk!!

67
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,760
You're too harsh on Kumacy.
You're beary harsh.

68
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,080
Why are you goofing off, punk?

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,580
"Shut up" means "be quiet"!

70
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,100
This shadow will bring me one step closer

71
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,500
to becoming the King of the Pirates, Hogback!

72
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,190
It's been a decade since we first met.

73
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,470
I put all of my prowess into creating
No. 900 for a day such as this!

74
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,360
With that shadow in it,

75
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,590
I'm certain it'll become the
most powerful zombie in history!

76
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,440
It will be a great asset!

77
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,280
The day I become the world's
"King of the Grave" is close at hand!

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,420
I can practically see the day I turn
the cute critters of the world

79
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,830
into zombies and make them
serve me in my dream kingdom.

80
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,710
Right! You can command absolute loyalty
from the shadow of the nastiest bastard!

81
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,840
The world will transform into a
land filled with obedient zombies.

82
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,000
If I'd had a subordinate as powerful as this,

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,510
that idiot Kaido never would have
defeated me in the New World.

84
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,680
Let's wake him up!

85
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,930
Gyoro! Nin! Bao!

86
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,440
Yes, Master!

87
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,780
Open the door to the special freezer!

88
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,730
Right away, Master!

89
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,030
Wait for me, No. 900.

90
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm bringing the ultimate shadow down to you,

91
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,580
so be quick about making
me King of the Pirates!

92
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,480
Spider Mouse!

93
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,130
Sir!

94
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,740
Toss Straw Hat Luffy's body onto the ship.

95
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,590
Don't forget to remove the spider silk.
We can't have him dying on us.

96
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,550
--Roger!
--One moment! I need to make a report!

97
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,070
What is it?

98
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,060
Captain Tararan, the spider monkey,
was just defeated!

99
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,880
He was defeated?

100
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,440
It's not as though the foe removed his shadow.

101
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,190
But that's exactly what happened!

102
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,010
He lost his shadow?!

103
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,820
R-Right!

104
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,220
Absalom, there is only one
man who could do that...!

105
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,410
The Humming Swordsman!

106
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
It sounds like Hildon's report
was accurate after all.

107
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,750
What a disaster!

108
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,630
It looks like the Humming Swordsman
is removing shadows wherever he goes.

109
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,890
We've already suffered heavy losses
before anyone realized he was here.

110
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,900
At this rate, we're going to relive
the nightmare of five years ago!

111
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,810
What?! We have to go back to the ship?

112
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,170
You mean Sunny?

113
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,760
Right. The worst they'll do
to your captured crewmates

114
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,650
is steal their shadows!

115
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,740
But it's not as though that's fatal.

116
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,980
Just look at me! I'm a prime example.

117
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,750
Oh, I actually did die!

118
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,380
But that's a different story!

119
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,240
When ya get down to it, it's not
like losing your shadow'll kill you.

120
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,640
Precisely! But the thing is,
everyone falls unconscious

121
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,570
when their shadow is snatched away.

122
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,560
They won't awaken for two days.

123
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,760
The stronger the person,
the sooner he is put on a ship

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,270
and kicked out of Thriller Bark.

125
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,030
Why do you think they'd do that?

126
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,490
To prevent the victims from returning
to the island to recover their shadows?

127
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,370
Bingo!

128
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,660
Then why don't they kill us
when we're out cold?

129
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,080
They can't.

130
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,050
This is important, so pay attention!

131
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,080
For starters, even if you separate
a person from his shadow,

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,390
they are still of one mind and body.

133
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,760
If the human dies, the shadow will disappear.

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,030
That means the zombie will die then as well.

135
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,930
That wouldn't serve the enemy's needs!

136
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,340
Hence they always keep the human body alive.

137
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,650
So even if your friends lose their shadows,

138
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,730
I promise they will get sent
back to your ship alive!

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,750
The worst case scenario would be for
the two of you to fall victim as well!

140
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,740
It would mean that all of you are doomed
to wander the ocean without your shadows!

141
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,710
Awaken your friends while
there is still time to act!

142
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,880
This is the only chance you get to look
for a way to recover their shadows.

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,810
Did you understand all of that?

144
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,690
I see. Everything sounds logical enough.

145
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,150
Here, guys, take this.

146
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,250
What is it?

147
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,000
The zombies' weakness!

148
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,990
You saw how effective it was in my
battle against this spider monkey!

149
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,330
What's that?!

150
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,300
It's the zombie's "soul."

151
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,130
His soul?! But I can see it leaving his body!

152
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,220
C-Captain!

153
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,260
It's high time you returned...

154
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,970
...to your rightful master!

155
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,450
This is their weakness? What exactly is it?

156
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,410
It's salt.

157
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,990
Salt?! If we gotta purify
the things to take 'em out,

158
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,040
are they some kinda curse?

159
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,020
Well, I suppose they are in a way.

160
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,320
The zombies were originally
animated thanks to a Devil Fruit.

161
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,800
Salt holds the power of the ocean.

162
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,440
So just as a power holder
grows limp in the ocean,

163
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,520
the salt breaks the fusion
between a fake soul and a body.

164
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,580
Makes sense! So that monkey spewed out
the shadow that was inside of him, right?

165
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,530
That never would have occurred to me.

166
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,690
To reiterate, please stuff salt into
a zombie's mouth to defeat it!

167
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,510
That's the trick! Even for this
bag of bones, that's a snap!

168
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,750
--Snap! Snap! Snap!
--But Brook...

169
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,340
Why are you so knowledgeable
about the zombies and this island?

170
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,470
That has to do with when I lost
my shadow five years ago...

171
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,700
Naturally, they sent me back out to drift at sea.

172
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,430
Fortunately, I was able to
turn back by the time I awoke.

173
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,000
And thus I returned to the island and fought.

174
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,870
I faced the zombie who holds my shadow!

175
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,050
But in the end, I lost miserably.

176
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,210
I fled for fear of my life.

177
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,470
No matter what...

178
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,750
No matter what, I did not want to die!

179
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,360
I am the sole survivor from my ship!

180
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,890
Someday I must pull out of the Devil's Sea

181
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,160
and carry out the promise I made to my friends!

182
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,790
So I ran for my life!

183
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,000
But ultimately, extending my
life did not resolve anything.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,880
So I am done running!

185
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,010
Until I defeat that man and recover my--

186
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,070
Well, you'll have to pardon me.

187
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm in a hurry. Take care!

188
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Stop right there!

189
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,260
On top of everything you've told us,
answer this one question before you go.

190
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,610
The Humming...!
Grah, the Humming Swordsman!

191
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Damn it! He's the only person to have
figured out my zombies' weakness!

192
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,950
Huh? Huh? How did he figure
it out in the first place?

193
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,960
What is she doing?

194
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,000
And how did he come back--

195
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,830
Hey, Cindry-chan! Why do you
keep standing in front of me?!

196
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,330
Humming Swordsman...

197
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,300
I've heard about him, but what is he like?

198
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,160
Perona! Don't you know what he looks like?

199
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,730
That would explain how he
slipped through your recon.

200
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,790
So it would seem.

201
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,850
Master, the seed of trouble
has returned to our island.

202
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,230
That's none of my concern, simpleton!

203
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,210
You can deal with him!

204
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,820
H-Hey!

205
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,960
Sorry for the wait!

206
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,290
Now then, let's go to the freezer!

207
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,510
It's freezing!

208
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,800
Sir...! The present condition is such...

209
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,040
Stupid! You should have mentioned that first!

210
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,830
If that's the case, he should
buy us plenty of time.

211
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,520
Sir!

212
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,510
Come report to me if there
are any other problems.

213
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,190
Now go toss Straw Hat out!

214
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,320
Roger!

215
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,240
Ready, go! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

216
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,160
Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho!
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

217
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,960
--Luffy!
--Stupid! Don't pop out!

218
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,680
He won't die just because they took his shadow!

219
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,390
Remember Brook!

220
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,380
Uh huh...

221
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,510
Kumacy, hurry it up!

222
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,340
Coming!

223
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,800
We can't leave now! Let's bide our time.

224
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,180
They're going to do something
with Luffy's shadow.

225
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,370
We gotta find out what!

226
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,020
We can worry about recovering it later!

227
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,940
That duo is long gone.

228
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,320
Where did they go?

229
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,540
I never expected them to defeat Tararan!

230
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,410
Whoa, there!

231
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,680
Oh, here's the spot!

232
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,590
Jeez! Did you get lost, Jigoro?

233
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,390
Off my back! Now where are my foes?!

234
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,300
Let me face them now! Give me enemies!

235
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,790
Franky...

236
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,140
What is it, punk? I'm not crying, you dummy!

237
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,020
Don't look at me!

238
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,280
What compelled you... to ask him that?

239
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,530
Shut up! I can ask whatever I want!

240
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,280
Gosh darn it! I freaking love that skeleton!

241
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,680
You'll never find a better guy!

242
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,250
Darn it all!

243
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,790
You sure won't.

244
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,770
They really are scary!

245
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,070
Th-The Humming Swordsman... is terrifying!

246
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,240
I was so scared...

247
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,410
But I won't give up!

248
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,380
I will never, ever give up!

249
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,420
Never!

250
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,840
I will recover my shadow!

251
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,100
I can't wait!

252
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,570
When I saw his corpse in the Land of Ice,
my body wouldn't stop trembling.

253
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,420
It's breathtaking when you
think that this terrifying beast

254
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,700
used to terrorize the seas 500 years ago!

255
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,090
--Cold!
--When he conquered a nation, he'd carry
the entire island back to his domain.

256
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,500
It's said he created a kingdom of thugs.

257
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,020
I was so close to the famous giant
known as the legendary "Continent Puller."

258
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,770
I-I'm freezing!

259
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,510
Where the heck are they going?

260
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,200
Beats me, but I think they said
something about a special freezer...

261
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,890
That explains it!

262
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,850
The Land of Ice? A corpse?

263
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,510
I never dreamed I'd get to see
that legend with my own two eyes!

264
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,510
This is a zombie creator's--

265
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,150
Hey, Cindry-chan! Why are
you walking in front of me?

266
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,820
Yet another legend shall come back to life!

267
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,880
Long time no see, No. 900.

268
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,550
Now, it's time for him to awaken!

269
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:51,590
He is the only berserker to have
gone down in history as a "Devil."

270
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,220
Oars!

271
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,780
What's going on? They put
Luffy's shadow in that giant!

272
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,470
We've finally uncovered the
secret behind the zombies.

273
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,780
Ouch! Let go! What's your problem?

274
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,970
Nami, what's wrong?

275
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,680
It's that invisible man again!

276
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,230
Nami, you're... vanishing!

277
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,980
Wh-Why...?

278
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

279
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,270
"Awakening After 500 Years!!
Oars Opens His Eyes!!"

280
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
