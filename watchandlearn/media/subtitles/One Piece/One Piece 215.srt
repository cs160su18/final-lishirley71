2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,050
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,710
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,220
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,610
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,440
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,670
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,300
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,600
Incredible!

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,250
The Straw Hat Dangers
come from behind to win

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,570
the final round of the Davy Back Fight!

26
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,780
I lost... And so did my Slow-Slow Beam...

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,680
All right! We did it!

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,330
Thank goodness! What a relief!

29
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,790
--It all worked out in the end.
--Yep.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,070
Now it's time to take someone!

31
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,280
Who do you choose, Straw Hat Luffy?!

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,260
Chopper! Come back!

33
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,430
Oh, no! Choppy!

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,020
Thank you! I'm so happy!

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,360
Don't cry! You know we'd never lose!

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,900
The grueling Davy Back Fight
has come to an end!

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,760
Both teams ultimately reach a
draw as the Straw Hat Pirates

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,050
take back their ship doctor, Chopper!

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,500
--The competition is now ov--
--Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,170
There are no "draws" in the pirate world!

41
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,140
It's either plunder or be plundered!

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,670
Right, Straw Hat?! Well?!

43
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,840
Wh-What's he tryin' to say?!

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,560
What do you say to another
three-coin game right now?

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,220
Is he an idiot?

46
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,770
Seriously! Who'd agree to
more of these lame games?!

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,030
Ack! You can't be serious!

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,110
You're on!

49
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,270
--What the heck are you thinking?!
--You stupid rubber monkey dimwit!

50
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,130
--You idiot! Moron!
--How can you be so stupid?!

51
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,960
This is the last time... I won't do it again...

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,800
We have to fight them again?!

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,750
Nothing we can do now.
He's already agreed to it.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,080
He must have something in mind.

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
I wouldn't be so sure...

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,480
Or maybe he's planning
to snag us a shipwright?

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:20,480
"Screaming-Hot Bombardment!
Pirate Dodgeball!"

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,110
It's time for the second three-coin game!

59
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,310
The events are a team-wide ball game,
a six-on-six all-star retro game,

60
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,490
and a one-on-one fight!

61
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,860
Like last time, each person
can only participate twice!

62
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,460
Lineup changes won't be allowed!

63
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,520
They're gonna take me for sure this time...

64
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,820
No, it'll definitely be me...

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,180
It's my fate to wind up as their idol...

66
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,070
--Not interested.
--Huh?
--Why not?

67
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,220
--You're weak.
--And scary.

68
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,370
Okay, it's time for Round #1: Hit and Dead Ball!

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,600
As always, I'll explain the rules!

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,980
Two balls are used!

71
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,650
Players throw these balls at
opposing team members on the court!

72
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,410
Get hit and you're disqualified! Outta the game!

73
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,910
Whichever side runs out of
on-court members first loses!

74
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,040
You're free to choose which members
should be on or off the court!

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,700
But keep in mind that although
off-court members can throw the balls,

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,340
they're not allowed to enter the court!

77
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,380
I see. So it's basically a variation of dodgeball.

78
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,120
Be sure to carefully read the rule book
for other miscellaneous details!

79
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,770
--Rule book?
--It's rather thick...

80
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,110
Yes! Hit and Dead Ball is the greatest

81
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,620
and most time-honored Davy Back Fight game!

82
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,610
Many rules have been added
over time, little by little,

83
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,450
to make it a more clear-cut game!

84
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,870
There's no point in having strict rules
if you're not gonna follow 'em!

85
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,660
It's obvious you're just gonna
keep ruling in their favor again!

86
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,210
Non, non, non! Read the very first page!

87
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,110
"Referee Regulations."

88
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,630
"He who makes a judgment contrary
to these rules shall be beheaded."

89
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,380
Beheaded?! Yikes!

90
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,260
There you have it!

91
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,680
Incidentally, this game will be
officiated by a team of five referees

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,550
headed by Rokuroshi,
a fifty-year veteran referee!

93
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,360
Looks like it might actually
be a fair game for once.

94
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,530
Team Foxy has a veritable crowd
of players! A truly grand spectacle!

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,830
But the diminutive Team Straw Hat
pales in comparison...

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,230
As usual, they have a measly seven members!

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,620
Drop the "measly" part!

98
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,570
Okay, let's get it started!

99
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,590
We'll begin with the double jump!

100
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,130
Each team, bring two players forward!

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,470
I wanna do this, Zoro!

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,310
Be my guest! Go jump your heart out!

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,910
Yeah!

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,010
Oh! Ship's doctor Chopper has changed form!

105
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,240
He appears to have mysterious abilities!

106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,190
He could be formidable indeed!

107
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,070
Oh, my! What is that? That's not cute at all...

108
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,180
All right! Let the game begin!

109
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,130
Oww!

110
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,090
All right, that's it! Now clobber 'em!

111
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,030
Okay! Here goes, Chopper!

112
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,510
Aim for Split-Head!

113
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,430
Right!

114
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,480
Our boss is in trouble!

115
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,200
H-He's already out of the game?!

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,880
All right! We showed their boss who's boss!

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
Doesn't count! Doesn't count!

118
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,730
What?! That was a clear hit!

119
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,500
Article 23! Hits to the face don't count!

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,230
What?!

121
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,420
Darn it!

122
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,460
You okay, Boss?

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,380
You shouldn't laugh, Hamburg-san...

124
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,390
Now's our chance!

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Hit 'em like crazy and win!

126
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,730
Okay! I'll hit them like crazy and win for us!

127
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,320
Here they come! Run for it, ya know!

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,160
Th-There's no need to get that fired up...!

129
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,000
Eighteen members of Team Foxy
are out for going out of bounds!

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
Yes!

131
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,180
Amazing! They each knocked
nine people clear off the court!

132
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,770
Ugh! The same number as you?!

133
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,270
Way to go, Sanji! Way to go, Zoro!

134
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,600
So sorry.

135
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,040
Wow! Nine people each!

136
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,620
Okay! I'm next!

137
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,540
Gum-Gum Slingshot!

138
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,470
Ten members of Team Foxy
are out for going out of bounds!

139
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,150
All right! A new record!

140
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,890
Wow, another big group is out of the game!

141
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,310
But Team Foxy finally has one of the balls!

142
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,980
Now it's my turn!

143
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,970
Get 'em, Chopper!
Knock eleven out for a new record!

144
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,400
Okay! You got it!

145
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,360
Oh! Our very own Hamburg
has fended off the attack!

146
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,550
Team Foxy now has both balls!
It's finally time to fight back!

147
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,780
Well done, Hamburg!

148
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,850
--Give the balls to Big Pan!
--Right!

149
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,130
Eep!

150
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,940
Get 'em, Big Pan! Send 'em all flying!

151
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,860
Whoever he hits is a dead man! A goner!

152
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, no!

153
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,520
Wh-What is this?!

154
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,390
Long-nose and 22 Team Foxy members
are out for going out of bounds!

155
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,330
Usopp! Are you all right?!

156
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,590
I-I'm somehow still alive...

157
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,860
I got the ball now...

158
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,320
Big Pan took out Usopp,
the long-nosed sniper, with his power throw,

159
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,210
but wound up knocking out a slew
of his own teammates in the process!

160
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,040
Team Foxy is down to two players!

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Have their superior numbers
backfired on them?!

162
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,590
This doesn't bode well!

163
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,010
What will they do now?!

164
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,910
--What now, Boss?
--Whadya mean, "What now?"

165
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,490
I can't use my Slow-Slow Beam as long
as that archeologist chick is there...

166
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,080
So there's only one thing to do...

167
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,400
You mean... you-know-what?

168
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,360
Yes. You-know-what.

169
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,590
Oh, my! Now Hamburg is out of the game too!

170
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,010
Nice, Robin!

171
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,640
The top of the head doesn't count!

172
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,940
No, Page 103, Article 54 states
that the top of the head does count.

173
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,110
She's correct.

174
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,030
Don't do anything shameful!
Do you want to be beheaded?!

175
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,180
Sorry...

176
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,320
Wow! Robin has a sharp mind!

177
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,790
Has she memorized the entire thick
rule book in such a short time?!

178
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,910
You're amazing, Robin!

179
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,130
I haven't read all of it yet, though.

180
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,430
All right! Just one left!

181
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,500
Finish 'em off, Sanji-kun!

182
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,420
Yes, Nami-san!

183
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,890
Sanji-kun!

184
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,010
Yes?!

185
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,470
Please don't hit him...!

186
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,340
Give us the ball, okay?

187
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,940
--Of course!
--Ack!

188
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,660
Thanks!

189
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,780
Now please get out of the game!
Okay, Twirly Eyebrow Man?

190
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,610
My pleasure! Please hit me wherever you like!

191
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,030
What are you doing, Sanji-kun?!

192
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,300
Oh! Love Hunter Sanji has been
blissfully and passionately knocked out!

193
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,590
He's the second Straw Hat out of the game!

194
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,880
Bye-bye!

195
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,220
You mellorine moron!

196
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,830
He never changes...

197
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,020
Still, their boss is the only one left.

198
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,730
You never know for sure, until the very end.

199
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,260
Precisely.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,030
Huh? What is that?

201
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,240
Huh?

202
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,700
There it is! The top-secret
item of Hit and Dead Ball!

203
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,080
Say hello to the Mr. Accu-Cannon!

204
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Hey! You're just gonna allow that, Ref?!
It's clearly against the rules!

205
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,130
That's the Mr. Accu-Cannon?

206
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,890
What's with that "I already knew
about it" reaction of yours?!

207
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,310
I didn't know what it was referring to,
but I came across it in the rule book.

208
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,300
Yes! Rule 322: the only weapon
allowed is the Mr. Accu-Cannon!

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,440
Is that really a rule?

210
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,910
It's so cool! I like it!

211
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,330
This is stupid!

212
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,990
Hey! Bringing that thing out now
still ain't gonna help you!

213
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,970
I wouldn't be so sure.

214
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,330
Porche! Are you ready?!

215
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,950
Sure am, Boss!

216
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,110
Here goes!

217
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,790
Flower Hypnosis!

218
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,920
Crap!

219
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,090
It's hypnosis! Don't look!

220
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,510
Always pulling these tricks on us...

221
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,240
Now, Boss!

222
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,820
All right!

223
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,760
You're all mine!

224
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,100
Having your eyes open or closed...

225
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,900
...makes no difference to a swordsman.

226
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,190
Incredible! What power!

227
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,990
Swordsman Zoro sliced the ball in two

228
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,280
with his bare hands and with his eyes closed!

229
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,530
Oh, no...

230
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,800
Zoro of Team Straw Hat is out!

231
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,780
What for?!

232
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,080
Rule 645!

233
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,810
No slicing the balls!

234
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,920
Team Foxy gets a new ball.

235
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,270
What?!

236
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,010
Too bad!

237
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,640
Oh, what a shame!
Swordsman Zoro is out of the game!

238
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,250
Zoro...

239
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,520
...got knocked out of the game...

240
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
Crappy swordsman...

241
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,730
You got knocked out first, lousy cook.

242
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,860
Things are really getting good now!
It's two against one!

243
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,490
Now to pick up where I left off!

244
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,200
Yeah! Give us your best shot!

245
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,790
Bring it on!

246
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,370
Ultra-fast Level 5!

247
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,260
Let's see you dodge this!

248
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,770
Oh! Choppy!

249
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,620
What a beautiful self-sacrifice
by ship's doctor Chopper!

250
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,910
--But this means...!
--The face doesn't count, right?

251
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,720
F-Face?

252
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,080
I-it's extremely difficult to tell
where his face begins and ends!

253
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,010
Talk about brave!

254
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,470
Hey, Ref! You're a man of the sea too,
ain't ya?! That was his face!

255
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah! That furry fella has some serious guts!

256
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,010
You ain't men if you can't see that!

257
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,740
It hit his face! It hit his face! It hit his face!...

258
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,640
What the...?

259
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,760
It hit his face! It hit his face! It hit his face!...

260
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,530
We "ain't men"...?

261
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,490
I can't just ignore that!

262
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,610
The call is clear as day!
It hit his face! He's safe!

263
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,280
All right!

264
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,270
However...!

265
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
However...?

266
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,610
Although it hit you in the face,
you're unfortunately still out of bounds!

267
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,210
Oh, my! He's regrettably out of bounds!

268
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,270
Just after his gutsy face
catch was given the okay!

269
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,620
What a pity! Ship's doctor
Chopper is out of the game!

270
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,180
Even so, he's still a true man of the sea!

271
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,290
Choppy!

272
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,650
You okay, Chopper?

273
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,020
Yeah... But I'm out of the game now...

274
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,240
Just leave the rest to me!

275
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,910
But never mind that. Thanks, Chopper.

276
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,870
Hearing that doesn't make
me happy at all, you jerk!

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
Not bad, Choppy! Now I
wanna have you even more!

278
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,920
I won't let you take him!

279
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,560
It's now one against one!
Both teams have their backs to the wall!

280
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,390
It's the final showdown!

281
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,270
Take my advice and lose like a good little boy!

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,440
I absolutely won't lose!

283
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,020
What nonsense!

284
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,900
Take a good look around you
before you spew such drivel!

285
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,180
Here it comes! The Omni-Directional Shift!

286
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,370
Say your prayers!

287
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,330
Yikes! What the heck?!

288
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,170
Hey! What's the deal, old ref!
What's with all those balls?!

289
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,380
There's no rule whatsoever
against using fake balls.

290
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,750
I knew it. You really are on Foxy's side.

291
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,610
Damn! They'll always have the upper
hand unless we get a ref of our own!

292
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,350
Don't worry, Luffy! Only you
and their boss have a real ball!

293
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,190
Don't let him fool you!

294
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,720
Ack! That's right!

295
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
What's with this guy? Is his brain split too?!

296
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,460
My brain... split too...

297
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Oh! Then I'll just send that
entire Mr. Neato Thing sky-high!

298
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,160
Here goes!

299
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
Huh?

300
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,830
Try this on for size!

301
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,380
Huh?

302
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,670
Oh! Right over here!

303
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,140
You stretched your arm too far!

304
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,560
All right, everyone! Shuffle!

305
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,980
Shuffle! Shuffle! Shuffle! Shuffle!...

306
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,860
Oh, no! Now we can't tell
which is real and which are fake!

307
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,530
Once again, which one is the real deal?!

308
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,830
You'll need to figure it out
before it hits you, though!

309
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,400
Shut up! It doesn't matter
as long as I catch all the balls!

310
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,810
Don't get snarky with me!

311
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,560
You're one sore loser, you know that?!

312
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,370
All right, men! Throw like crazy!

313
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,470
You're...

314
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,820
...finished!

315
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,740
Luffy! Look out!

316
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,590
Luffy! Let it hit your face!

317
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,120
You're a heartless monster!

318
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,830
Yes!

319
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,380
All right!

320
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,060
Straw Hat Luffy is out!

321
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,640
What for?! Getting hit
in the face doesn't count!

322
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,020
Rule 999! No swallowing the balls!

323
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,030
It's right there in the rule book!

324
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,240
He's right. It's on the very last page.

325
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,200
A l-lousy rule like that...?

326
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:06,090
Team Foxy emerges victorious in
Round #1's game of Hit and Dead Ball!

327
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,090
Stupid!

328
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

329
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,710
Chasing after something constant

330
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,340
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

331
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,590
Even when we're exhausted

332
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,760
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

333
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,180
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

334
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,100
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

335
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,900
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

336
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,860
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

337
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,940
Eternally... Eternally...

338
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,740
Wild fantasies from our childhood

339
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,570
We trace unforgettable memories

340
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,250
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

341
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,040
To this familiar sunny sky

342
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Together we entrust our feelings

343
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,460
We go beyond the changing time

344
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,260
Eternally... Eternally...

345
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,410
Round #2 is that game from my childhood!

346
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,340
This is a pirate game! All weapons
and obstacles are allowed!

347
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,720
--Go get 'em, Zoro and Sanji!
--You're a member too!

348
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,460
But that cheetah and the others are back!

349
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,260
Me and Nami are too weak and scary anyway!

350
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,310
Zoro-kun? That's a scary look! Stay away!

351
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,530
On the next episode of One Piece!

352
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,020
"Showdown on the Cliff!
Red Light, Green Light!"

353
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,390
Huh? Zoro's lost again?!
