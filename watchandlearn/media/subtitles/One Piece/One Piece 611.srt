2
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,740
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,460
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,220
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,060
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,340
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,190
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,010
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

14
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,190
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,510
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,940
an island with two parts,
one burning, the other frozen.

17
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,410
After learning about the ruler of the island -
Caesar Clown, aka the Master's motive,

18
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,330
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni,

19
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,290
along with their pirate ally -

20
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,840
the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

21
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,960
they are on the move to kidnap Caesar,

22
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,340
save the children,

23
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,000
and escape from the island.

24
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,260
Did you just say something?

25
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,930
Who the hell are you?!

26
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,900
Who are you?!

27
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,770
"A Small Dragon!
Momonosuke Appears!"

28
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,990
Momonosuke?

29
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,830
THE BASEMENT OF C BUILDING -
A GARBAGE DUMP LUFFY'S GROUP

30
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,100
That is my name.

31
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,400
I heard that name before somewhere.

32
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,020
Where was it?

33
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,960
How do I know?

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,390
It must be somebody else.

35
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,580
More importantly, you...

36
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,970
...stop drooling!

37
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,310
You can't eat me!

38
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,600
If you try to eat me,
I'll eat you first!

39
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,920
Behave yourself!

40
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,570
MOMONOSUKE (DRAGON)

41
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,580
Oh?

42
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,470
Maybe "Momonosuke" is
stuck on a dragon's body

43
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,190
and he's talking with his farts...

44
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,400
Hey, where are you?!

45
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,370
What are you doing?!

46
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,370
Here we go!

47
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,800
He's torn in half! I'm sorry!

48
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,260
Oh, I'm finally separated from it-bu!

49
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm not talking with my farts!

50
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,680
How rude!

51
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,890
What are you talking about?!

52
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,010
Come to think of it, that dragon

53
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,840
was bigger

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,010
and we already ate it.

55
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,270
Who are you then?

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,910
What?!

57
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,580
An eel is talking to me?!

58
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,900
Stop drooling!

59
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,940
I'm not an eel!

60
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,830
You're starving, aren't you?

61
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,100
Don't be ridiculous.

62
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,000
Samurai warriors don't get hungry

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,600
after just ten days of fasting.

64
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,980
Ten days?!

65
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,680
Who are you and
why are you here?

66
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm Luffy.

67
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm gonna become
the King of the Pirates!

68
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
P-P-P-P...

69
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,570
P...

70
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,450
You must be joking.

71
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,810
Pirates are big, heavyweight men.

72
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,200
They are more violent and strong-looking.

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,780
Anyway, eel, how can I get out of...

74
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,870
It's Momonosuke!

75
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,090
So you're from somewhere
else, too, aren't you?

76
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,170
All I know is there are
so many sick children here.

77
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,690
I don't even know what kind of island
this is and what happened to me.

78
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,730
It all began when I happened
to stow away on a ship.

79
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,410
I tried not to be so friendly

80
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,120
but those children were kind to me.

81
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,060
They're giving out food.

82
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,290
Aren't you hungry?

83
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,680
Shut up!

84
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,370
I don't want any!

85
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,520
I am a samurai!

86
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,980
I don't accept alms!

87
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,380
They were very nice to me

88
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,140
but I was on edge so...

89
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,470
I got you some food.

90
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,070
I said I don't want any!

91
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,020
You better eat something.

92
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,190
We're all separated from parents
so we must stick together...

93
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,780
Nobody can understand how I feel!

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,620
THE BISCUIT ROOM

95
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,280
I am "Master" Caesar!

96
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,210
Come on in!

97
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,820
This is your playground from today!

98
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,230
There are many giant children!

99
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,050
Are they sick, too?

100
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,570
You can count on me!

101
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll treat you all at any cost!

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Hi!

103
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,430
We're all friends from today!

104
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,700
Thank you!

105
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,970
Hey, what about you?

106
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,940
What's your name?

107
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,330
I don't have

108
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,450
a name.

109
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,490
Here.

110
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,950
Have some snacks.

111
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't want any!

112
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,370
Candy?

113
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,500
I don't want any!

114
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,590
A FEW DAYS LATER

115
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,760
Hey, is it true that one of the kids escaped?

116
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,870
Yes but everybody on the
boarding list was accounted for.

117
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,770
That's strange.

118
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,480
In any case,
let's split up and search.

119
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,370
How can I get out of here?

120
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,370
Hey, you!

121
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,810
You were on the same ship with me.

122
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,030
Do you remember me?

123
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,550
Oh, so your name is Momonosuke-kun.

124
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,700
This is a "secret room"
where no one is allowed.

125
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,590
You're so annoying.

126
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,800
Don't get involved with me.

127
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,610
Why?

128
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,620
Because...

129
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,690
There is no reason!

130
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,220
I'm just looking for an exit.

131
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,230
I'm gonna get out of here.

132
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,510
There is something I need to do.

133
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,110
I know it's hard but every child here
is going through the same thing.

134
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,280
Everybody wants to see his or her
father and mother as soon as possible.

135
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,580
All of us came here from
different islands to be treated

136
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,660
but everybody feels the same way.

137
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,920
There are so many things I wanna do

138
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,620
if I could just get back home!

139
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,000
Everybody is friendly at the
Biscuit Room and it's fun there.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,070
You can forget the pain.

141
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,170
So why don't you eat
something, Momonosuke-kun?!

142
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,590
Well, but...

143
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,990
Hm?

144
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,810
What's wrong?

145
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh no, somebody's coming!

146
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,890
Let's go, Momonosuke-kun!

147
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,690
The door to the secret room is open!

148
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,530
Come on!

149
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,300
Don't worry about me!

150
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,200
Just go!

151
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,340
Anybody there?!

152
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,030
Wh-What is it?!

153
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,680
Who is it?!

154
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,570
A d-dragon?!

155
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,960
What's going on?

156
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,080
I don't know.

157
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,500
M-Momonosuke-kun...

158
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,580
Look!

159
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,570
If I remember correctly,

160
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,690
there was a man-made Devil
Fruit that Vegapunk created here.

161
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,950
I heard it was a failure.

162
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,060
Yeah, I heard so, too.

163
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,320
That pain in my chest I felt suddenly -

164
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,900
I thought my heart was gonna explode!

165
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,790
I had trouble running before.

166
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,200
What happened...

167
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,030
So I am originally a human.

168
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,500
You ate a Devil Fruit, huh?

169
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,610
And it made you an eel man, maybe?

170
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,380
Eels don't have horns.

171
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,010
Then why don't you turn
yourself back into a human.

172
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,360
What?!

173
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,870
I-I can turn myself back to myself?!

174
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,060
How?!

175
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,510
I don't know.

176
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,980
I'm not a Zoan-type.

177
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,770
By the way, I wonder
how high this ceiling is.

178
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,940
I can't even see the hole
that I fell through.

179
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,160
I want to get out of here, too,

180
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
and tell those children the truth!

181
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,820
I happened to hear something!

182
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,100
That Caesar guy was talking...

183
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,260
We have another group
of good obedient kids.

184
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,680
The other kids are growing
bigger without problem.

185
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,180
But, after all, this is an experiment
to see the limitations of drug dosing.

186
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,480
I don't think they can take it that long.

187
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,600
I assume they'll all be dead in five years.

188
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,830
So we need to find more kids.

189
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,070
Well, experiments come with failures.

190
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a necessary sacrifice.

191
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,700
Those stupid kids can help
the world's greatest scientist -

192
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,370
Master Caesar Clown

193
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,740
and do good for the world!

194
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,320
Even if it's a short life,
they have to be happy with it!

195
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,890
Don't you think?!

196
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,120
I thought he was a doctor

197
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,740
but he is actually a bad man

198
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,440
who is going to let the children die!

199
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,020
And the kids have no idea.

200
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,070
Here.

201
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,240
Have some snacks.

202
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,120
I know it's hard but every child here
is going through the same thing.

203
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,970
Everybody wants to see his or her
father and mother as soon as possible.

204
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,130
I feel sorry for them.

205
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,690
If I don't do anything,

206
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,650
I should be ashamed of
myself as a samurai warrior!

207
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,090
I was on my way to tell the
children but I fell down here

208
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,390
when I tried to hide in a trash can.

209
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,900
Caesar!

210
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,270
Alright, Momo,

211
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,130
I'm gonna climb up there.

212
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,500
I'll take you with me!

213
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,260
What?!

214
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,120
How are you gonna climb that high?!

215
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,750
I'm gonna climb the wall.

216
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,580
Hold onto me!

217
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,870
What?!

218
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,260
Don't worry about the children.

219
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,840
My friends are on their way to help them.

220
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,880
Really?!

221
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
They always keep their word!

222
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,260
So don't worry!

223
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,540
Okay!

224
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,200
What I thought was right!

225
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,060
You are not an ordinary...

226
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,860
...pirate.

227
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,300
What's the matter?

228
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,040
What happened?

229
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,370
Are you too hungry?!

230
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,700
Hey, stay with me!

231
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,430
Stay with me! Stay with me!

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,580
Hey, stay with me!

233
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,520
Stay with me! Stay with me! Hey!

234
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,330
Stay with me!

235
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,670
Stay with me!

236
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,690
Stay with me!
Stay with me! Stay with me!

237
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,550
Stay with me!!

238
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,970
Wh-What?!

239
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,730
What's going on?

240
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,780
Hey, what's the matter?!

241
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,660
H-Hey!

242
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,250
Hey, wait!

243
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,090
We're...

244
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,380
flying!

245
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,140
AT THE BACK OF 2ND FLOOR OF B BUILDING
A PATH AT AN EXAMINATION ROOM

246
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,970
I wonder if Nami and the others
are doing okay without me!

247
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,450
Well, at least Zoro is with them!

248
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,150
I'll save you at any cost

249
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,950
so wait for me, Momonosuke!

250
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,480
Brook!

251
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,610
Let me know if you see the

252
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,170
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs
that Robin told us to find!

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm sorry, corpse-dono!

254
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,760
I have to depend on your sorcery!

255
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,570
Count on me!

256
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,530
I just need to look
for samurai-san's son

257
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,740
and some Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs, right?

258
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,640
Let's check the other side of that wall.

259
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,730
Was his name Momonosuke-kun?

260
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,150
I bet he is a boy
who dresses like samurai-san!

261
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,570
Hey! Where are you?!

262
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,910
D BUILDING - THE "SAD" MANUFACTURING ROOM

263
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,130
My Armament Haki
surpasses your ability by far.

264
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,690
I think you're smart enough to know

265
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,010
that it's useless to fight against me.

266
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,000
Smoker.

267
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,150
Or are you trying to avenge
those dumb-asses' death?

268
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,740
They're not gonna die that easily -

269
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,870
they're not that weak!

270
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,980
Even though they're misfits,

271
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,870
they're still Navy soldiers!

272
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,390
Shave!

273
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,380
Don't mess with the Navy!

274
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,650
I didn't know you cared
so much about your men,

275
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,780
Smoker-kun.

276
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,170
B BUILDING - NEAR THE BISCUIT ROOM

277
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,260
Everybody, this way!

278
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,670
Get to the Biscuit Room
where the children are!

279
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,720
Hurry up! Hurry up!

280
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,880
You guys are too slow!

281
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,120
The deadly gas is right behind you!

282
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,270
If you don't wanna die, run faster!

283
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Hurry up!

284
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,600
Ouch!

285
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,810
Brother, don't kick me!

286
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,150
Ouch, brother!

287
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,550
Come on, everybody!

288
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,940
Hurry up!

289
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,570
Don't kick me!

290
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,610
Ouch!

291
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,680
The Black Foot brother is gonna
kill us before the deadly gas does!

292
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,810
Don't be a baby!

293
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,000
He's crazy!

294
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,890
Hurry up!

295
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,730
If you wanna save the children,

296
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,420
go to the Biscuit Room now!

297
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,340
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - THE BISCUIT ROOM

298
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,200
It's cold! The whole
room is in a blizzard!

299
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,410
I just took off my coat!

300
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,410
What is a Snow-Snow Fruit?!

301
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,010
Damn that snow woman!

302
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,840
Everybody, stop!

303
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
You shouldn't eat the candy!

304
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,770
Mocha, run!

305
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,770
Wait, Mocha!

306
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,680
Give us the candy!

307
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,650
No! You all have to
come to your senses!

308
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,720
You can't have it all to yourself!

309
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,780
Stop running!

310
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,740
I'll try to hold them,
if even for a little while.

311
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,210
Don't do that.

312
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,500
Robin!

313
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,800
Are you alright, Robin?!

314
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,420
Oh!

315
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,820
You're Pirate Hunter Zoro

316
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,940
with a 120 million berry bounty!

317
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,570
You three, go stop those kids!

318
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,710
She's a Logia-type.

319
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,950
I'll take care of her!

320
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,090
Even while he's at the mercy of Monet's ability to freely manipulate snow,

321
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,720
Zoro still tries to let Nami and the others
escape, despite the relentless attacks.

322
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,890
It's then that Monet transforms
into a terrifying monster

323
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,260
and the situation worsens.

324
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,980
The crew find themselves backed into a corner.

325
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,690
"A Deadly Fight in a Blizzard!
The Straw Hats vs. the Snow Woman!"

327
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
