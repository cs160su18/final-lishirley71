00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,650
Robin!

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,900
You can go ahead and say
you wanna die or whatever,

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,950
but say those things... by our side!

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,960
Just leave the rest to us!

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,560
They've come all this way
after crossing Aqua Laguna.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,400
When you think about it, it's incredible.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,230
Seems like they've at least got good luck.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,610
This time, we have permission to kill them.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,520
It's easy when we don't have to
worry about going easy on them.

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,570
Drawbridge?

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,980
Yeah. The Franky Family is
currently fighting to bring it down.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,710
Once it comes down, we can go
over to the other side at once.

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,700
Geez... When it's right in front of us...

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,170
You idiot...

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,960
Seriously, just how terrible is
the burden this woman is bearing?

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,560
Hey, CP9! Listen!

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,970
I give you permission to kill them,
but take them on here at the Tower of Law!

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,940
The most important things of
all are my life and promotion.

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,870
If I let them do as they want,
who'll protect me when something happens?!

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,830
You stupid pirates!

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,510
Get it in your heads that putting on
a brave front doesn't change anything!

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,340
You're up against the power
of the assassin group CP9

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,180
and the weight of the Gates of Justice
that can't be opened by human strength.

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,840
And above all things, right now...

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,150
...I have the authority to exercise Buster Call

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,110
by using this golden transponder snail!

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,940
Buster Call...!

29
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,330
That's right.

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,570
It's the power that wiped out your hometown

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,890
exactly twenty years ago, Nico Robin.

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,870
I remember that the following year, the name
"Ohara" had been wiped off of the map.

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,080
Robin's hometown?

34
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,460
That damn masked jerk!

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,890
There's no place for me to go or go back to.

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,630
Don't!

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,050
Not that!

38
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,600
I like that reaction. It gives me a chill.

39
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,150
What? Does it mean that you
want me to press this button

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,390
to activate Buster Call? Hm? Does it?

41
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,860
Do you really understand what'll
happen when you press it?

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,790
I do. It'll eliminate the possibility of
the pirates escaping from this island!

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
Just with this single button.

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,420
It's that simple.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,580
It won't be that simple!

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,930
Are you remembering something?

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,750
If you like, shall I try pressing it?

48
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,960
Right here, right now?

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,210
What're you doing?! Stop it!

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,760
You sure talk cocky, don't you?

51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,050
You said that "Ohara" had
been wiped off the map.

52
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,040
Can you see humans on a map?!

53
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,880
Because you guys see the world that way...

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,240
...you can do such a cruel thing!

55
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,940
Buster Calls are a heartless power that
even makes you lose sight of your goal.

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,110
You mustn't use it. Not that.

57
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,420
Never...! Not that!

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,010
"20 years ago - 'West Blue'
Ohara"

59
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,420
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,800
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,810
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

62
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,690
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

63
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,570
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,370
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

65
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,620
we will be able to make it through

66
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,880
Always!

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,590
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

68
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,560
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,600
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,190
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

71
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,500
We can't stop here

72
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,520
Around the world

73
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,780
Start me up!

74
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,520
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

75
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,590
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

76
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,550
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

77
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,340
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

78
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,350
Brand New World

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,770
Start me up!

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,430
"Robin's Past! The Girl
Who Was Called a Devil!"

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,700
Hey, Robin's there!

82
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,450
Get her!

83
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Ow!

84
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,610
All right!

85
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,610
Hey, monster!

86
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,550
You're creepy!

87
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,850
Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster!

88
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,790
Ahh! The monster hit me!

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
She's creepy!

90
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,070
We'll get you for this!

91
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,640
Hey, you!

92
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,900
My children came home crying,
saying that you hit them for no reason.

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,060
Stay away from my children.

94
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,810
Pfft!

95
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,200
Why don't you say something?!

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,990
Geez... You really are a creepy child.

97
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,490
Hey, wait!

98
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm not done with you yet!

99
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,110
Mommy, Mommy, what're we
having for dinner tonight?

100
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,080
What'd you like to eat?

101
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,490
Um... Um...

102
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,760
Rice omelet!

103
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,920
You sure like rice omelets, don't you?

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,220
--Yep!
--We have to buy lots of eggs, then.

105
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,780
All right!

106
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm back. I'm sorry I'm late.

107
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,290
Aunt Roji?

108
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,730
"To Robin. Today is..."

109
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,740
...our daughter's birthday.

110
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,520
So we decided that the three of us
would go out for dinner as a family.

111
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,860
There's some bread,
so just have that for dinner.

112
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,080
Don't use too much jam.

113
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,860
After dinner, before we get home,
do the dishes, clean the house,

114
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,160
and take the laundry in, then go upstairs early.

115
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,730
Mommy, Mommy, what're we
having for dinner tonight?

116
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,080
What'd you like to eat?

117
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,820
Um... Um...

118
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
Rice omelet!

119
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,150
You sure like rice omelets, don't you?

120
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,240
--Yep!
--We have to buy lots of eggs, then.

121
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
All right!

122
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,710
Oh! There she is! Robin's here!

123
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,680
Looks like she came to return a book.

124
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,410
Everyone, to your positions.

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,420
Good evening, Professor Clover!
I came to return the book I borrowed.

126
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,010
One, two...!

127
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,980
Congratulations, Robin!

128
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,210
--You're amazing, Robin!
--Just as we'd expect from a genius!

129
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,830
We've got a cake for you!

130
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,300
Robin, the exam for the doctoral
degree you took the other day...

131
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,340
You quite amazingly got 100% on it!

132
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,700
Hence, from today on,
we acknowledge you as an archaeologist.

133
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,270
Now you're one of us and
we'll do research together.

134
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,350
Here, this proves that you're
a scholar. Take this, Robin.

135
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm happy for you, Robin.

136
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,520
Congratulations!

137
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,140
Listen, Robin. You must understand well
what it means to be an archaeologist.

138
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,630
Yes, Professor Clover!

139
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,850
Knowledge comes from the past.

140
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,170
This Tree of Knowledge is 5,000 years old.

141
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,210
A massive amount of literature
has been brought to this tree

142
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,870
from all over the world over
a very, very long period of time.

143
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,990
It's an irreplaceable treasure for all humanity.

144
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,300
This is the biggest and oldest library in
the world whose pride is its knowledge.

145
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,890
And superior archaeologists
from all over the world

146
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,070
gathered under this Tree of Knowledge.

147
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,690
When using these books,

148
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,180
there's no historical mystery
that we can't solve.

149
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,740
Got that, Robin?

150
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,670
Yes!

151
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,210
I'd like to see you contribute to the
world by researching various cultures.

152
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,480
Professor! I'd like to solve
the mystery of "Blank History"!

153
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,280
Wha... No! You shouldn't! I forbid
you to do it, just as I always have.

154
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,340
What? Why? If we research the Poneglyphs,

155
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,120
we'll know what happened during
the "Blank Century," right?

156
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,830
Why do you know that much?

157
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,730
Did you peek into the
basement using your powers?!

158
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,590
But...

159
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,530
You should know that trying to decipher
the Poneglyphs is a criminal act!

160
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,580
What...?

161
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,740
But... you guys have been
researching the Poneglyphs

162
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,970
in the basement late at night!

163
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,650
Robin! How come you know that?!

164
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,320
Explain yourself! Are you saying that
you've been spying on that, too?

165
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,680
Answer me, Robin!

166
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,400
That's because...

167
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,070
...you wouldn't let me in the room
even if I openly came and asked!

168
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:52,660
I thought... you'd let me be part of your
research if I became an archaeologist.

169
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,170
So I studied very hard!

170
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,540
Robin...

171
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,260
It's true that you've acquired enough
knowledge to be called a scholar.

172
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,350
But you're still a child.

173
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,040
If they find out what we're doing,
our heads will roll.

174
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,980
We're doing it fully aware of the risk.

175
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,170
Ever since it became law 800 years ago,

176
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,790
there actually have been numerous
scholars who lost their lives.

177
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,960
This is a good opportunity,
so let me tell you this.

178
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,520
We of Ohara are the only ones in history

179
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,160
who managed to decipher the ancient texts.

180
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,620
We cannot go back.

181
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,990
Swear to the Tree of Knowledge!

182
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,970
If you try to approach the basement again,

183
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,250
I'll forbid you from entering the
research lab and the library! Got that?

184
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,270
Robin!

185
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,030
She's following in her
mother's footsteps in every way.

186
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,490
She still doesn't know about
the incident from the other day.

187
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,450
Robin's mother, Olvia, has been captured.

188
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,040
You can tell what fate awaits her.

189
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,970
"The following day"

190
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,430
Grrr!

191
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,860
W... Wa...

192
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,650
Worms?

193
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,790
That hit the spot!

194
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,660
I somehow survived...

195
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,360
I wonder if she's okay, too.

196
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm saved for now. Thank you.

197
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,840
Is there a town or something on this land?

198
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,250
Yeah.

199
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
I see.

200
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,860
If I was going to drift to somewhere,
I would've liked an uninhabited island.

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,040
You can stay there if you want,
but nothing's gonna happen.

202
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,710
My leg got injured, so I'll stay put here.

203
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,130
I'm planning to make a raft or
something and leave here eventually.

204
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,030
This your first time seeing a giant?

205
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,110
Yep.

206
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,460
I'm telling you, don't lump me
in with those guys from Elbaf.

207
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,280
There are peaceful giant tribes, too.

208
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,140
I see...

209
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,680
I know it's a long shot, but I'll ask you anyway.

210
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,070
When you get home, I don't want
you to tell anyone about me.

211
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,750
Okay.

212
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,340
That was too easy. She'll definitely tell.

213
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,240
I won't tell.

214
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,430
That's a lie! There's no way
that a child can keep a secret.

215
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,480
I won't tell because I'm not interested in you.

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,780
"Dereshi"?

217
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,950
What does that mean?

218
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,740
What does it mean? I'm just laughing.

219
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,620
You're laughing?

220
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,660
You're a funny girl.

221
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,470
That's a weird way of laughing.

222
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,660
I've always been told that
I'm not good at laughing.

223
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,600
You're cute when you laugh.

224
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,540
--What?
--You should laugh more.

225
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,980
My name is Saul. Jaguar D. Saul.

226
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,990
"D"?

227
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,270
Yeah. I don't know why, but everyone
in my family has it in their names.

228
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,450
What's your name?

229
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,060
Robin.

230
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,530
I see. To tell you the truth, Robin,
I'm being pursued right now.

231
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,110
So if people find me, I'll be in trouble.

232
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,480
I said I wouldn't tell!

233
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,890
"Three days after the giant drifted ashore"

234
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,880
This is yummy!

235
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,240
Here's another one.

236
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,570
I appreciate the thought,
but you go ahead and eat it.

237
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,570
I'm not hungry, since I caught some
fish and ate them during the night.

238
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,330
Okay.

239
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,760
Well, it'll be completed soon.
I'll keep working on building a raft.

240
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,910
In any case, you sure have lots
of time on your hands, huh?

241
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,950
You've been with me all day
long for the past several days.

242
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,980
Your friends and parents will get suspicious.

243
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,610
I don't have parents.

244
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, I do have a mother,

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,630
but she set sail for work when
I was small and hasn't come back.

246
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,160
So I don't even remember her face.

247
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,820
I like those archaeologists, but they
don't let me be part of the research,

248
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,620
so I'm being left out.

249
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,750
Kids in town say that I'm creepy,
so I won't play with them.

250
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,750
Oh, so you're a Devil Fruit power holder, huh?

251
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,880
You aren't scared?

252
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,410
I used to travel in the Grand Line,

253
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,190
so I saw many dreadful
Devil Fruit power holders.

254
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,180
I see... I envy you.

255
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,460
That looks convenient!

256
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,540
You really do laugh in a weird way.

257
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,830
Weird or not...

258
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,100
...you know...

259
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,750
...if you laugh, it'll make you happy.

260
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,440
Why?

261
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,520
"Why?" When you're having fun, you laugh.

262
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,760
Which means if you laugh, it'll become fun.

263
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,320
Although you're only a child,
you seem to be having a hard time.

264
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,930
So laugh. When you're
having a hard time, just laugh.

265
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,910
It seems stupid to laugh
when you're having a hard time.

266
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,630
That's not true.

267
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,160
Now, you try, too.

268
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,620
Dereshi.

269
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,700
That's right! Do it like this!

270
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,680
That's good! That's good!

271
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,990
This is Navy Headquarters.

272
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,140
Chief Spandine, please come in.

273
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,500
They want to talk to you, Chief.

274
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,570
Just ignore it. I'm sure they
just want a status report.

275
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,100
We'll contact them when we see the shore.

276
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,630
I don't care whether it's Ohara or Opera--

277
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,410
why do I have to come all
the way to the West Blue?

278
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,620
Seriously...

279
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,660
What a worthless mission...

280
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,840
"The following day, four days
after the giant drifted ashore"

281
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

282
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

283
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,190
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

284
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,190
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

285
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,450
We'll become No. 1

286
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,320
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

287
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,530
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

288
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,700
an era created by risking everything

289
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,830
We always try our best, let's go!

290
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,830
If we want to achieve glory,

291
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,210
now is the time--don't be afraid

292
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,130
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

293
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,090
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

294
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,090
We can take off with unknown powers

295
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,350
We don't fear, and we don't waver

296
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,060
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

297
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,100
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

298
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,070
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

299
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,320
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

300
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Charge ahead

301
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's start running towards tomorrow

302
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

303
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,960
So you don't even remember your mom's face?

304
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,990
No, but I wanna see her.

305
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,870
Is your mom also an archaeologist?

306
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,310
Yep. She's traveling in search of
the history no one knows about.

307
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,000
Wh-What's your mom's name?!

308
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,020
"Fated Mother and Daughter!
The Mother's Name Is Olvia!"

310
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
