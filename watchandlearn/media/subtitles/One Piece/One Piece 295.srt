00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,920
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,850
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,330
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,410
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,460
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,010
Wait!

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,270
What you're holding is...

36
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,650
Whaaat?!

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:15,090
"Navy"

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920
The silver transponder snail
has received a signal!

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,150
A Buster Call has been requested!

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,580
A Buster Call has been
requested by Admiral Aokiji!

41
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,280
Where?

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,090
Enies Lobby!

43
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,550
Have five of the Vice Admirals
near the destination respond!

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,990
Considering the distance,

45
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,760
I think it's quicker to head
there from headquarters.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,270
How quick?

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,220
It's possible to get there within 30 minutes.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,770
Immediately have ten battleships
get ready to set sail,

49
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,690
and summon five Vice Admirals!

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,930
Be swift!

51
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,710
Yes, sir!

52
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,310
A Buster Call has been requested!

53
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,730
The destination is Enies Lobby!

54
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,200
Have ten battleships get
ready to set sail immediately!

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
Hey! Hey!

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,320
Yes, Chief.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,530
Dammit! Oh, crap! This one is
the portable transponder snail.

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,540
What have I done? I wasn't careful.

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,500
Of all things, I pressed the button
on the golden transponder snail!

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,960
Of all things...

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,880
...I requested a Buster Call!

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,840
Everyone! Leave the island!

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,850
A Buster Call has been
requested on Enies Lobby!

64
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,810
If you stay on the island, you won't survive!

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,230
This isn't your concern!

66
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,950
A Buster Call has been requested!

67
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,520
Battleships are coming!

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,490
Get off of Enies Lobby!

69
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,870
What was that?!

70
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,470
Where was Robin speaking from?!

71
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,060
The other side of these doors.

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,910
I can't let you pass. At least
give me time to say that.

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Coo coo.

74
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,420
Get out of my way.
Robin's behind those doors, right?!

75
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,590
So she's there. So what?
You won't be able to see her...

76
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,050
...ever again.

77
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,850
No... I'll go there to see her!

78
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,190
I'll be right there, Robin!

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,360
"Five Namis? Nami Strikes Back with Mirages!"

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,410
Stand up, Nico Robin!
Stand up already, you bitch!

81
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,040
What's that look in your eyes?!

82
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,930
Cancel the Buster Call right away!
There may still be time!

83
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,220
Shut up! You're still saying that?!

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,810
I'm the Chief of CP9! There's no way I can say,

85
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,320
"I made a careless mistake and
requested a Buster Call" now, you idiot!

86
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,370
What do I care how many casualties it'll cause?!

87
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,430
Once I hand you over to the World Government,

88
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,210
my future is all set!
That's all that matters, right?

89
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,590
That won't happen. Never!

90
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,540
What?

91
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,700
Everyone is... Luffy is...

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,380
...right behind us.

93
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,710
Don't get the wrong idea.
There isn't even a shred of hope for you.

94
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,240
The one who's fighting Straw Hat
right now is CP9's strongest member,

95
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,790
Rob Lucci, whose Power Level is 4,000!

96
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,500
Don't tell me you seriously
think that brat can defeat him...

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,080
Even if a Buster Call is invoked
or Straw Hat is right behind us,

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,990
that doesn't change the situation at all!

99
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,740
Do you get that, you bitch?!

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,000
Luffy... Everyone...

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,130
Robin!

102
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,160
It's a Buster Call!

103
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,830
Battleships are coming!

104
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,750
Hurry up, or we'll be burned to a crisp!

105
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Get out of here!

106
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,110
That looks funny!

107
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,490
But no one's come here, when I
thought I'd show them the way.

108
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,270
It looks fun over there.

109
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,040
Chimney. Gonbe. What're you two doing?

110
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,930
Oh, Grandma!

111
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,350
Well, I found a weird hole.

112
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,310
Then, I took the pirate guy there.

113
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,260
And then, and then,
the pirate guy became small!

114
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,820
Small?

115
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,930
But, but, he did wham!

116
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,290
Wham?!

117
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,250
Right?!

118
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,370
Oh? That pirate kid did?

119
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,450
I don't quite understand,

120
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,070
but it sounds like it's getting
more and more interesting.

121
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,230
Things have suddenly started happening, huh?

122
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,950
Sounds like if I stay in this tower
too long, I may lose my life.

123
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,500
If you're gonna run, then leave the key here.

124
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,000
Shave!

125
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,430
I wanted to spend more time playing with you.

127
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,430
Shoot!

128
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,530
But we have to evacuate quickly, too, so...

129
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,710
Golden Bubbles!

130
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,050
This is the same attack that got Sanji-kun.
Even though I was being careful...

131
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,060
I can't hold the Clima Takt.

132
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,990
My entire body is slippery! I can't stand up!

133
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,550
How dare you make my body like this?!

134
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,960
Although it has the downside
of reducing your curves,

135
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,840
it does give you the most beautiful skin.

136
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,210
I envy you.

137
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,890
But in return, your fighting
power is reduced by half.

138
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,670
You should just give up on the key I have.

139
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,220
I... I can't do that!

140
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,080
Cool Charge!

141
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,510
That's no use. Playtime is over.

142
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,120
Tempest Kick!

143
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,430
What?

144
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,990
Mirage Tempo. I'm right here.

145
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,990
When did you...?! What's going on?

146
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,620
Finger Pistol!

147
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,370
Another fake! Where are you this time?!

148
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,460
This way! Right here!

149
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,800
What's that?!

150
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,550
Sh-She grew huge?!

151
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,560
What?

152
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,780
So you were a power holder, too!

153
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,020
She's a ditz.

154
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,040
A Buster Call has been requested.

155
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,910
Hurry up!

156
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,710
Go! Renowned sword, Nose Storm!

157
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,420
Tempest Kick!

158
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,840
Finger Pistol!

159
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay! Good job!

160
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,390
Tempest Kick!

161
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,520
Finger Pistol!

162
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,600
Again?! Ahhh! No!

163
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,710
Zoro-kun! This plan really is reckless!

164
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,000
I suggest you stop this immediately.

165
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,420
No, wait.

166
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,220
What?

167
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,470
Our enemies are totally seized by fear

168
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,480
after seeing the power of the
renowned sword, Nose Storm.

169
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,300
What?! I-Is that right?

170
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm back!

171
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,220
To think that he turned his friend into a sword...

172
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,090
He sure attacks recklessly.

173
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,060
Ha! He's just desperate.
It's just pointless resistance.

174
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,770
Zoro-kun! I've made up my mind! I'll do it!

175
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,070
This is the turning point of this fight!
Let's keep the plan going!

176
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,810
Go ahead and fight with no restraint!

177
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,210
That's what I wanted to hear!

178
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,810
Renowned sword, Nose Storm!
Killer Attack, Makie!

179
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,830
"Makie"

180
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,490
"Makie"?!

181
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,920
"Makie [lacquer]"

182
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,870
Oh! That's a beautiful,
splendid killer attack name,

183
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,760
suited for the renowned sword Nose Storm.

184
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,850
I like it, Zoro-kun!

185
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,640
Huh?

186
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,640
What? Um...

187
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,120
Hm?

188
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,360
What's that? It looks as if
he's asking us to kill them.

189
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,450
O-Oh...? Hmmm?

190
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,740
Z-Zoro-kun, what on earth are you doing?

191
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,680
I'll get them first!

192
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,700
I'll be the first!

193
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,140
Shave!

194
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,680
Dammit! To think that you used
that masked idiot as a decoy...

195
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,600
That was close.

196
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,000
So by "Makie," you meant
"bait" instead of "lacquer"?!

197
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,600
"Makie [lacquer]"

198
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,770
"Makie [bait]"

199
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm not tasty.

200
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,210
Am I bait? A decoy?
What a horrible man you are!

201
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,150
One more time. Killer Attack, Makie!

202
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,740
I don't even have a say in this?!

203
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,530
Besides, you're using those
words "killer attack" wrong!

204
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,580
Aren't I the one who'll get killed here?

205
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,960
Zoan type... So is that your trump card?!

206
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,290
Seriously, that's not me!

207
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,510
At any rate, this form...

208
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,110
It looks like a reindeer, and I know that
hat and the mark on it without a doubt.

209
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,080
But I can't believe...

210
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,190
...this is Chopper!

211
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,820
What savage beast's power does she hold?!

212
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,360
Moon Walk!

213
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,990
Tempest Kick!

214
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,310
Hey! Stop it!

215
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,040
What?!

216
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,230
Chopper! Hey, you're Chopper, right?

217
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,170
How did you become like that?!

218
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,800
I wonder if he can't recognize me,
since I look like this.

219
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,350
Aren't you Chopper?!

220
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,740
Let me tell you something!

221
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,520
I didn't think that was you!

222
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,350
Chopper!

223
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,900
Sh-She ignored me! How insolent!

224
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,430
Chopper! What's wrong?!

225
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,820
Take a good look at me! It's me! I'm Nami!

226
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,130
Chopper!

227
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,130
Chopper! Stop it!

228
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,250
Sanji-kun is downstairs!

229
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,770
Where did such a monster stray in here from?

230
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,870
Don't hurt him! He's my friend!

231
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,850
What happened to Chopper?

232
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,060
This is terrible. I have to stop him right away.

233
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,260
That's your friend? You pirates
sure own a creepy pet, huh?

234
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,700
Chopper!

235
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,910
She ignored me again! How insolent!

236
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,260
You're free to go stop that monster,

237
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,750
but I have a duty to stop you, too.

238
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm gonna hurry up and finish it here.

239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,580
Tempest Kick!

240
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,510
This is bad! Even the soles
are slippery. I can't dodge it!

241
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,500
Huh?! I could dodge it!

242
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,230
Ah... My right leg went back to normal.

243
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,480
Why? What caused it?

244
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,740
It's wet...

245
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,400
It got wet in the earlier
commotion. Oh, that's right!

246
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,500
Water! I can wash off
the soap power with water!

247
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,170
Aren't you being too optimistic?

248
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,180
Even if you figured out how
to undo Golden Bubbles,

249
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,260
there's no way I'd let you do that.

250
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,730
Sheep Cloud! Relaxing Bubbles!

251
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,980
I'll blow away those bubbles with wind!

252
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,500
Cyclone...

253
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Shoot!

254
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,370
O... Oh, no... My strength is...

255
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,960
Supple Finger Pistol!

256
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,040
Takt...

257
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,290
Whip!

258
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,940
That was helpful.

259
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,140
Helpful?

260
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,280
If you blow me away like that,

261
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,650
the annoying bubbles on my
body get blown away, too.

262
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,120
That's a bluff. If you so wish,
I'll keep blowing you away until you die.

263
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,020
The weather forecast is cloudy!

264
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,690
Cloudy Tempo!

265
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,260
This is different from the
magic show stuff I used to do!

266
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,890
Clouds? More lightning?

267
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,940
Thunder doesn't get generated
from such thin clouds.

268
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,770
Instead, they'll condense!

269
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,530
Don't tell me...! No, she might do that!

270
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,400
The weather forecast is rain!

271
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,990
--Cool Ball!
--Shave!

272
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,030
Pour down! Rain Tempo!

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,250
You're not sweet at all. After I was nice
enough to make your skin silky smooth.

274
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,590
If being sweet means not
putting up a fight, then I'll pass.

275
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,800
Cool Charge!

276
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,500
What?

277
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,860
Mirage Tempo!

278
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,760
She disappeared?!

279
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,480
Now I understand... your powers...

280
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,150
...as well as the strength of CP9.

281
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,000
What's this?!

282
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,400
Mirage Tempo...!

283
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,340
Fata Morgana!

284
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,550
Hey, is that really Chopper?

285
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,120
How come he doesn't recognize us?!

286
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,010
Who else has those antlers and wears that hat?!

287
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,720
Hm? Hey, wait a sec, Franky-kun!
That attack pose...

288
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,020
What're you trying to fire?! He's one of our...

289
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,440
D-Don't be reckless!

290
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

291
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,030
"Nami's Decision!
Fire at the Out-of-Control Chopper!"

292
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
