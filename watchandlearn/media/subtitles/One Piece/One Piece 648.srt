We are the one! Go ahead!

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

We are the one! Go ahead!

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,880
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,710
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,030
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,740
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,070
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,040
he decided to enter and fight fierce battles

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,750
among other tough contenders from the New World.

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,880
"Chinjao the Drill."

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,710
That's what they used to
call me but not anymore.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,820
Answer me!

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,260
Do you know what Garp has done to me?!

84
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,690
I told you - I don't know!

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,760
Since you're that bastard Garp's grandson,

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,930
I can't just let you walk away
because you have no idea!

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,070
For 30 years,

88
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,980
I've been holding a grudge!

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,010
Say it, Straw Hat!
What has Garp done to me?!

90
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,900
What did he take away from me?!

91
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,400
Hey soldier, what's your point?
What's going on here?

92
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,970
What I wanted to show you is...

93
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,380
...this country is filled with both

94
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,180
the forgotten and those who forgot them!

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,650
All of us toys were once humans!

96
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,050
What?!

97
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,430
A Devil Fruit eater who Doflamingo
brought 10 years ago,

98
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,200
turned us to toys!

99
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,500
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

100
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,270
What is she doing?! Pick up already!

101
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,820
You have no mercy!

102
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,350
I'm all thumbs so...

103
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,260
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

104
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,570
Why is she not picking up?! Nami-ya!

105
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,380
I know I'm not calling the wrong number!

106
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,290
It's Usoland's Haki!

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,330
So powerful!

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Look, my body trembles with excitement
so the ground is shaking!

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,540
How awesome!

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,010
He's unbelievable!

111
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,400
By the way, Leo,
you people keep saying "fight" but...

112
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,770
...why do you wanna fight Doflamingo?

113
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,390
What?

114
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,930
The hero's very funny!

115
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,060
We want to rescue the 500 friends who are

116
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,200
forced to work
at the shady factory, of course!

117
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,140
The battle will take place in Dressrosa!

118
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,540
Underneath the Colosseum!
At the shady factory!

119
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,900
Let's go, everybody!

120
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,010
Yeah!

121
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,230
"Making a Sortie!
The Legendary Hero Usoland!"

122
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,700
THE TONTATTA KINGDOM - UNDERNEATH GREEN BIT

123
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,100
Usoland! Usoland!

124
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,820
Usoland! Usoland!

125
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,630
Usoland! Usoland!

126
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,380
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!...

127
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,590
Going underground?

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,130
That's right.

129
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,970
There is an underground passage
between Green Bit and Dressrosa.

130
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,870
So we're gonna go through the passage
and meet up with your friends?

131
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,870
That is correct!

132
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,270
Are they really gonna fight Doflamingo?!

133
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,180
Here we are! At the airport!

134
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,910
An army of bugs!

135
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,220
How cute!

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,460
Yellow Cub 43 through 48
are prepared for takeoff.

137
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,340
Keep standing by.

138
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:20,580
Pink Bee 21, 22, 25, 26, proceed to Runway B.

139
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,830
This is Yellow Cub 43. Ready to takeoff!

140
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,840
43, cleared for takeoff.

141
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,740
Pink Bee Squad, ready to go!

142
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,530
Pink Bee, roger that.

143
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,750
All bugs, stand by and wait
for further instruction.

144
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,460
Oh, Usoland, watch your step!

145
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,170
Sorry!

146
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,300
Cub-san! Bian!

147
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,750
Leo, you're late!

148
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,780
CUB - A LEADER OF YELLOW CUB SQUAD
(BUG-BUG FRUIT, MODEL RHINOCEROS BEETLE)

149
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,520
We're ready to go!

150
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,230
BIAN - A LEADER OF PINK BEE SQUAD
(BUG-BUG FRUIT, MODEL HORNET)

151
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,480
We're gonna fly at high speed!

152
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,950
I'll be counting on you two!

153
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,890
Leave it to us!

154
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,240
Squad members have been
training so hard for today!

155
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,600
To save our friends and Princess Mancherie,

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,740
we had no other choice!

157
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,850
Yeah!

158
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,700
Uh-huh!

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,590
I've never seen this kind.

160
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,930
I wanna show it to Luffy!

161
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,330
Usoland! Robiland!

162
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,070
You two are big so take the 20 passenger bus.

163
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,980
Come on, Linear Foxes!

164
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,370
LINEAR FOXES - TWENTY-MAN BUS
(KON EXPRESS)

165
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,350
This is nice! It's like a couch for a king!

166
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,730
They're fast when they run.

167
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,720
Such beautiful hair!

168
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,080
Alright, everybody! Let's get going!

169
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
With our hero Usoland!

170
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,450
To take back the 500 friends
who are held captive!

171
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,460
Yeah!

172
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,750
It's really fast!

173
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,790
I think I have to tell you two...

174
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,680
...why we want to do this.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,880
Where're you coming out from?!

176
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,130
Gancho-san!

177
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,300
Boobie-morning! I'm the Tonta-chief - Gancho!

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,040
Thank you for doing this!

179
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,000
I want you to know since you're gonna risk

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,630
your life fighting for us.

181
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,740
No, I'm not gonna risk my life...

182
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,240
Don Quixote Doflamingo has
been causing us Tontatta Tribe

183
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,410
a lot of pain recently.

184
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,110
But our connection with him

185
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,950
goes way back before last decade, actually.

186
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,860
It goes back about 900 years ago.

187
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,740
What?!

188
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,660
Here in Dressrosa, there
is a vast sunflower field.

189
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,270
Somewhere in that field
of blooming sunflowers,

190
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,830
at a place no one knows,

191
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,410
there is a secret entrance.

192
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,650
Descend the stairs there,

193
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,520
and you will hear energetic voices.

194
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,150
Where's this connecting to?

195
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,430
You'll see soon.

196
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,370
Let me introduce!

197
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,400
Commander!

198
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,490
We've been waiting for you, Commander!

199
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,910
Thanks, you all!

200
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,850
AN ANTI-DOFLAMINGO COALITION -
"THE KING RIKU ARMY" HEADQUARTERS

201
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,390
He looks like a strong toy man!

202
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,950
What kind of Big Human was he?!

203
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,690
It's good to have him on
the day of the battle!

204
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,450
We're gonna fight with them!

205
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,320
They're Little People from the Tontatta Kingdom!

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,420
Little People?

207
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,000
They're as strong as you are.

208
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,060
They move so fast that
people can barely see them.

209
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,270
So they call them "fairies" in the town.

210
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,340
So the one who stole Zoro's sword was...

211
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,650
Let's go!

212
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,970
I thought that you wanted
to go back to your ship!

213
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,770
Hey, don't let him attack you, Luffy!

214
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,460
Young man, I can't see!

215
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,320
Zoro!

216
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,740
It was such a pain just to get here!

217
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
Let's get going!

218
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,920
Let's go to your ship!

219
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,930
You're some kind of idiot
like I said, aren't you?!

220
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,750
Damn, that bastard!

221
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,880
If there is an event like
this, why didn't he tell me?!

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,540
I wanna fight with my swords!

223
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,340
Oh, Commander!

224
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,060
Oh, Franky!

225
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,710
What are you doing here?

226
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,980
Commander, we already sorted out the intelligence
from the scouting unit!

227
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,560
We know what the enemies and Sugar are doing.

228
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,890
And, no big surprise, with
the battle close at hand...

229
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,030
That's right!

230
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,940
Some legendary heroes have appeared at Tontatta!

231
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,260
Their names are Usoland and Robiland!

232
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,990
They say they're on their way here!

233
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,410
On top of that, they have
some friends with them

234
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,590
and their names are...

235
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,590
...Luffyland, Zoroland, Namiland, Sanland...

236
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,630
...Chopperland, Fraland, and Boneland!

237
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,340
Must be Usopp!

238
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,550
Why did he tell such a lie?

239
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,590
Um, I think I'm Zoroland.

240
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm Fraland! Nice to meet you!

241
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,460
What?! Great!

242
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,190
They're so naive.

243
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,760
Oh, I don't have time for this!

244
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,780
I gotta get back to the Sunny!
Nami and the others are in danger!

245
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,390
I kept telling you so, didn't I?!

246
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,800
The Sunny?!

247
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,240
Lucy fended off this one easily, too!

248
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,220
The champion hopefuls -
Sai, the 13th leader of the Happo Navy,

249
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,910
and "Destruction Cannon" Ideo
have surprisingly been eliminated!

250
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,470
Will the legendary gangster
- Don Chinjao win?!

251
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,360
Or Lucy, the unknown powerhouse
who keeps going strong?!

252
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,000
You annoying grandson of Garp!

253
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,620
Eight-Impact Fist!

254
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,070
Head-Arms Spin!

255
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,340
That technique again?

256
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,580
Damn you!

257
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,380
Gum-Gum...

258
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,750
Take this and fly away!

259
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,450
...Jet Cannon!

260
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,390
Gum-Gum...

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,660
Take this and fly away!

262
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,000
...Jet Cannon!

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
What?!

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,160
What just happened?!

265
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,120
Jet Whip!

266
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,810
DRESSROSA - SANJI AND KIN'EMON

267
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,210
Go! Luffy-dono!

268
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,440
Why're you cheering with the others?!

269
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,490
But, Sanji-dono, when a man fights,
he has to win!

270
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,730
Isn't your friend captured at the Toy House?!
Are you gonna forget about him?!

271
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,730
That's right!

272
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,550
Burgess!

273
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,690
I heard that it's getting interesting!

274
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,790
Who is that little guy?!

275
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,350
GREEN BIT

276
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,580
What are you gonna do?!

277
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,770
There's nowhere to run!

278
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,540
Hey, Joker!

279
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,440
Before you kill him,

280
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I need you to take something back for me!

281
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,680
It's my heart! Law took my heart!

282
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,220
I don't know what he's gonna do with it!

283
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,870
Room!

284
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,990
Shambles!

285
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,450
That bastard!

286
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,540
It's no use!

287
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,580
Nobody can stop art!

288
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,380
Blow Kung-Fu...

289
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,680
...Art!

290
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,400
This is just smoke!

291
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,140
Here I go! Weather Egg!

292
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,580
Come on out, Snow Clouds!

293
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,280
Ewww! Disgusting!

294
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,320
You turned my Clima Takt into a toy!

295
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,780
What an insult!

296
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,000
Who did you call a super model?!

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,100
I didn't say that!

298
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,540
"Turned it into a toy"?
Don't confuse it with a toy!

299
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,650
You have no taste!

300
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,080
Yes, we have a Devil Fruit eater

301
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,950
who can turn people into toys in our family.

302
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,240
But I'm an art human who
ate the Art-Art Fruit!

303
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,400
You people have been turned into art!

304
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,640
"Art"?!

305
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,510
Damn! Nami got defeated, too!

306
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,540
But my antlers and hooves are useless!

307
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,920
Hey, Bone-kichi, she's trying to kidnap me!

308
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,800
I know! I'm not gonna let her do it!

309
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,420
But look at this.

310
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,530
My Soul Solid looks like this!

311
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,790
Why are you moaning like you're a victim?!

312
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,830
You should be happy that I made you artistic!

313
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,810
More importantly,
look what you did to my submarine!

314
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,410
And to my men!

315
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,640
To avenge them,

316
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,060
what kind of artistic death
should I bring to you?!

317
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,880
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

318
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,310
--Ring, ring... Clank.

319
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,540
--Hello? It's me! Who is this?!

320
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,790
We're in big trouble right now! Help us!

321
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,070
Who said you can pick that up?!

322
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,500
Chopper-san, way to go!

323
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,400
Is this Tony-ya?!

324
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,900
I don't care what's going on over there!
Listen carefully!

325
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
What?! Is this Tra-guy?!

326
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,200
Is it Law?

327
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,910
What are you doing, Tra-guy?!
Come to the ship now!

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,810
We got turned into art! Help us!

329
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,250
I-I'm just fine!

330
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,570
Listen, I need you to...

331
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,920
....sail the ship to Green Bit now!

332
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,390
I wanna leave Caesar with you guys!

333
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,220
I've got no time to fill you in!
Come to Green Bit now!

334
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,800
--Clank.
--What?!

335
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,940
Whaaat?! He asked us the
impossible and hung up!

336
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,320
I thought he already handed Caesar-san over!

337
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,470
What's wrong with him?!

338
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,470
He just talked
without hearing what we had to say!

339
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,480
Is he Luffy?!

340
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,510
I... h-h-have no problem!

341
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,140
I have nothing but a bad feeling!

342
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,150
What's going on out there?!

343
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,700
I can't take it anymore!

344
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,240
Bullet String!

345
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,720
It's no use, Law!

346
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,160
Who did you just call for help?

347
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,160
Give me back Caesar's heart already.

348
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,840
It's so meaningless for you
to keep hanging on here.

349
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:16,850
Your partner - Straw Hat has already
walked into the trap that I set up.

350
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,520
He's now fighting in the gladiatorial contest
at the Colosseum.

351
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,680
Tough contenders from all over
the world come to fight in

352
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,770
that outlaws-only, deadly competition.

353
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,440
When someone loses,
it's a one-way ticket to hell.

354
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,340
He will never come out
alive from the Colosseum.

355
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,170
It's the end of your alliance.

356
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,870
Law!

357
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,150
Just give up!
