2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,710
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,340
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,820
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,650
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,170
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,960
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,770
The look in Arlong's eyes changed!

25
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,810
You inferior human!

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,480
What did you do to me, a fishman?!

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,860
A Shark Saw!

28
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,070
That room is...

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,760
You can no longer escape.

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,060
This is the top floor of Arlong Park.

31
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,230
What's this room?

32
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,300
Full of papers...

33
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,620
These're not just ordinary papers.

34
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,770
This room is where I make that
woman draw sea charts. It's...

35
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,730
...the survey room!

36
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,740
Nami's room...

37
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,930
These're all sea charts that Nami drew.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,980
She's good. She draws
quite accurate sea charts.

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,410
In the past, as well as in the future,

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,720
her talent should be
used for us fishmen!

41
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,350
Nami is our friend.

42
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,350
Friend?

43
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,920
So don't interfere anymore...

44
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,800
...you damn rubber man!

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,140
What's that look in your eyes?!

46
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,620
She is...

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,290
Nami is...

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,360
...our navigator!

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,680
"End of the Fishmen Empire!
Nami's My Friend!"

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,730
You plan to make her the
navigator of some shabby boat?

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,460
You'd only end up wasting her talent.

52
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:19,140
Just look! How many people in this
world can draw such accurate charts?

53
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,600
The girl has a gift.

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,450
There's nothing as
unfortunate and foolish

55
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,090
as letting a natural-born
talent go to waste.

56
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,330
Staying here and drawing sea charts
is the greatest happiness for her!

57
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,630
This pen is stained with blood...

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,550
Nami's charts are absolutely vital
if I'm to attain world supremacy!

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,680
She's going to continue drawing
sea charts! For my ambition!

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
And once her charts give me full
knowledge of all the world's seas...

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,820
we fishmen will be invincible,
and the world will become our empire!

62
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,930
Our first stepping stone is this
island... and the East Blue!

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,360
Could you use the girl
as efficiently as that?!

64
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,430
Huh?! The Shark Saw
won't move one bit!

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,010
What?!

66
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,150
"Use"?!

67
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,440
What's goin' on inside?!

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,320
Dammit...
What happened, Big Bro Luffy?!

69
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,030
I can't tell what's
going on up there at all...

70
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Luffy...

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,370
What do you take her for?!

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,480
An inferior creature, but a smart girl.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,530
If all other humans are sewer rats,
I'd say she's a cheeky-as-hell cat.

74
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,720
After all, she is adorable.

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,180
And I'm going to keep on feeding
her and buying clothes she likes.

76
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,810
She'll have everything
she needs to live.

77
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,850
All she needs to do
is keep drawing charts for me.

78
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,710
She will forever be my tool...

79
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,660
...no, my friend.

80
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,090
What's that?!

81
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,040
A desk...

82
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,510
It's a desk!

83
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,110
W-Whew, just a desk.

84
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,700
Man, that scared me. I thought
it was Big Bro Luffy for sure...

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
Hold on, partner!

86
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,670
Are you sayin' you don't have
faith in Big Bro Luffy's strength?!

87
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,120
Huh?! You were scared too, Johnny!

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,830
D-Don't be stupid!
I was, uhh, you know...

89
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,920
O-Of course I thought
it was that damn Arlong!

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,870
Huh?! That sounds
kinda fake if you ask me!

91
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,470
Say what, you jerk?! Of course
there's no way Big Bro Luffy'd lose!

92
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,460
Luffy?

93
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
What do you think you're doing?!

94
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,690
What in the...?!
There's an awful lot of stuff flying!

95
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,930
Alright! As of today, this is your room!

96
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,230
Your desk, your pens...

97
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,240
Everything you'll need is here!

98
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,990
Stop that!

99
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,270
The charts!

100
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,920
M-My charts!

101
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,660
You damn brat!

102
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,190
Don't think you can trick me,

103
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,250
drawin' fake charts like that!

104
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,980
Do you have the time to be
drawing crap like this in secret?

105
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,970
Try to fool me again and I'll drag
people from the village one by one

106
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,640
and make you watch as I crush them!

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,420
Just like I did with her!

108
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,350
Damn you! I spent eight
years making her draw those!

109
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,430
I invested eight years in
those charts! In my ambition!

110
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,230
Bellemere-san...

111
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,730
Nojiko...

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,860
This... is a pretty intense fight!

113
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,540
Yeah! Looks like a fight to the death!

114
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,540
Definitely!

115
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you...

116
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,400
You've gone too far,
you damn rubber man!

117
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,780
"Fishmen are great"
and "sea charts" this,

118
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,190
"circumstances" that...

119
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,420
I don't know much
about any of that stuff...

120
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,280
But I finally figured
out how to save her!

121
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,850
She can't go because this room is here!

122
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,030
If she doesn't want to be here,
then I'll just destroy it all!

123
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,890
Gum-Gum...

124
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,130
Don't get cocky!

125
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,690
Arlong Park can't ever be brought
down by you inferior beings!

126
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,340
Shark Tooth Drill!

127
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,080
...Battle-Axe!

128
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,460
L-Look! That shock's
caused Arlong Park to...!

129
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,360
Impossible! It's gonna collapse!

130
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,130
This is dangerous!
Everyone, get away!

131
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,970
Big Sis Nami! Hurry!

132
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,300
But Luffy's still inside!

133
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,090
Big Sis!

134
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,350
Luffy! Luffy's still...!

135
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,690
Luffy!

136
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,470
I finally figured out how to save her!

137
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,610
She can't go because this room is here!

138
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,550
If she doesn't want to be here...

139
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,080
...then I'll just destroy it all!

140
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,910
Luffy!

141
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,010
Luffy...

142
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,220
Luffy...

143
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,490
Oww!

144
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,950
What's all this damn noise?

145
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,120
Luffy...

146
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,900
Arlong Park... has collapsed!

147
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,630
Big Bro...

148
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,360
What on earth happened inside?

149
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,870
Which one won?!

150
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,320
Given all this debris...
Don't tell me it was--!

151
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,840
Luffy...

152
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,270
Luffy!

153
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,990
Big Bro!

154
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,420
Is he okay?!

155
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
Nami!

156
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,630
You're my friend!

157
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,210
Yeah!

158
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,100
H-He won?!

159
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,570
He won...

160
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,520
He won!

161
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,970
He won!!

162
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,250
Arlong Park has fallen!

163
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,550
We did it, older sister!

164
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,170
Gen-san!

165
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,130
This... This isn't a dream, is it?

166
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,120
I never thought this day would come...

167
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,780
Way to go, Luffy!
You get my praise, too!

168
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Though I'd be praising you even more

169
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,280
if you would've been the
star performer instead of me!

170
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,600
Man, talk about being
on pins and needles...

171
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,080
Take care of things quicker
from now on, you damn jerk!

172
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,640
This is awesome!

173
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,530
Hold it right there, you!

174
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,530
He's...!

175
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,250
What a lucky day today is!

176
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,120
Well done. I watched the entire fight.

177
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,720
Fluke as it was, I never once
imagined the fishmen would lose

178
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,510
to a bunch of nameless pirates like you.

179
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,990
However, thanks to you,
all the money I was to give Arlong

180
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,270
and all the money and valuables
stored in Arlong Park are now mine!

181
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,510
Everyone drop your weapons!

182
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,600
I, Colonel Nezumi of Navy Branch #16,

183
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,350
hereby take credit for
what you've done here!

184
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,080
Zoro!

185
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,270
Don't ruin people's fun
when they're finally happy!

186
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,590
J-Just you try laying a
finger on me! You'll be sorry!

187
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,090
He's still sayin' it?

188
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,090
This is for shooting Nojiko

189
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,900
and tearing up Bellemere-san's
tangerine orchard.

190
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,590
Huh?

191
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,980
Colonel!

192
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,370
Thanks, Nami! That felt good!

193
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,810
Give 'im 1,000 more of those!

194
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,730
You guys are gonna clean
up after those fishmen now!

195
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,230
And you're gonna help
rebuild the town of Gosa!

196
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,130
And you're not gonna touch any
money or valuables in Arlong Park!

197
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,470
That's the island's money! Got it?!

198
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,470
Oww! Oww! I-I'll do what you say!

199
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,640
And one other thing!

200
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,350
Give me my money back!

201
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,360
I'll give it back! I'll give it back!
I don't care anymore...

202
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,490
I'll get you, you rotten pirates!

203
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,250
Straw hat man!
Your name's Luffy, right?!

204
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,030
You're the captain, right?!
Don't forget this!

205
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,200
Some major stuff's gonna happen
to you now! You've made me mad!

206
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,470
It's too late to regret
what you've done!

207
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,270
I'm gonna get revenge on you!
Just you wait and see!

208
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,450
Says some major stuff's
gonna happen now.

209
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,110
How does he know I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates?

210
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,080
That's not what he means!
Man, you're stupid!

211
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,680
H-Hey, what do we do?! What if we
really do wind up in big trouble?!

212
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,690
Hey! Hey! Hey, I said!

213
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,090
Alright, everyone! This is no time
for us to be the only ecstatic ones!

214
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,720
We need to tell everyone on the
island about this big incident!

215
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,230
Arlong Park...

216
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,810
Arlong Park has fallen!

217
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,470
Good for you, Nami!

218
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,410
To think we'd end up
being saved by pirates...

219
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,710
You never know what's
gonna happen next.

220
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,470
You seem to be in excellent
spirits, pathetic humans!

221
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,070
As of this moment,

222
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,980
this village-- no, this island--
is now under my control!

223
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,250
Gen-san! Help!

224
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,830
Keep your hands off the children!

225
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,470
T-That's an Arlong tattoo!

226
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,340
You...!

227
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,140
You can stop now...

228
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,660
You fought very well, carrying our
lives on your back all this time...

229
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,640
Gen-san...

230
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,250
And then it went boom!

231
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,060
We didn't know each other long!

232
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:44,020
Now, Bellemere's spirit
can finally go to heaven...

233
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,690
Hello?! Hello?!

234
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,660
Yes. This is Navy Headquarters.

235
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,230
Headquarters?! Navy Headquarters?!

236
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,540
Hello! This is Colonel Nezumi
of Navy Branch #16!

237
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,500
Marine Code 00733!

238
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,400
I have a request for HQ!

239
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
You don't need to shout.
I can hear you.

240
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,520
Listen! There's a pirate named Luffy,

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,700
who wears a straw hat!

242
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,420
Listen! There's a pirate named Luffy,

243
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,920
who wears a straw hat!

244
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,720
I deem him and his four crew members

245
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,390
as enemies of the government!

246
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,290
I deem him and his four crew members

247
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,060
as enemies of the government!

248
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,010
"Luffy"...

249
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,930
They managed to take down Arlong,

250
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,290
the fishman of Arlong Park who
was purported to be invincible!

251
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,030
Based on their threat
and dangerousness,

252
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,500
a large bounty has been placed
on their captain, Straw Hat Luffy!

253
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,940
Now sending a photograph!

254
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,250
Roger that.

255
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,940
Huh?!

256
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,680
Couldn't you have taken
a better one than that?!

257
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,410
No, that's all I could get...

258
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,420
After a quick verification,
I will submit it for approval.

259
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,090
Don't forget, now!
He's a vile pirate! "Dead or Alive"!

260
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,470
Put him on wanted posters
throughout the world!

261
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

262
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

263
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

264
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

265
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

266
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

267
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

268
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

269
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

270
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

271
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

272
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,480
It's finally goodbye
to Cocoyashi Village!

273
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,780
Nami! Bet you're happy to be onboard
with Great Captain Usopp again!

274
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,220
You idiot! Nami-san is joining
me on a journey of love!

275
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
No! Raw ham melon!

276
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,360
Bellemere-san. It took eight years,
but we're finally free!

277
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,320
On the next episode of One Piece!

278
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,960
"Setting Out with a Smile!
Farewell, Hometown Cocoyashi Village"

279
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
