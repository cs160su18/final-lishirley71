2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
What the heck...?!

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,140
It's a cloud road that looks like a belt...

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
--Oh, Nami-san, how pretty you are!
--It doesn't look like it was
created spontaneously.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,160
There's no way this is spontaneous!

23
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,060
That's the exit! There's something written!

24
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,340
Godland...

25
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,800
God's Land, Skypiea?!

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,930
It's not an exit... It's an entrance!!

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,910
"Godland, Skypiea!
Angels on a Beach of Clouds"

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,180
An island!

29
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,830
It's a sky island!

30
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,300
Hey... that sign... said Skypiea.

31
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,820
Yeah! That's the same name as the one
written on the map that Luffy found.

32
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,820
That galleon that fell on us
really did come here...

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,310
They saw this scenery
two hundred long years ago!

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,200
What is this place?!

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,810
You can really smell adventure in the air!

36
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,200
Ahhhh! You idiot! Wait!

37
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Your feet can touch the bottom.

38
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,290
Hey, you okay, Usopp?

39
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,760
Is this island made of fluffy clouds?

40
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,400
It's fluffy, isn't it?

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,090
It's fluffy!

42
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,870
Let's go ashore!!

43
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,920
The sky island!!

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,400
Oh, I'm coming, too!

45
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,430
I'm gonna go change!

46
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,990
Hey, Luffy! What about the anchor?!

47
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,910
There isn't seabed around here, right?!

48
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,350
Who cares?

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,390
Yeah, who cares?

50
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah!

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,350
--Forget about it!
--Forget about it!

52
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,060
Me too! Me too!

53
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,300
Come down already! This beach is fluffy!!

54
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,060
Rolly, rolly, rolly...

55
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,140
Let me do it, too!

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,830
Still, this scenery is amazing.

57
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,840
It's like something out of a dream.

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,630
Yeah, it sure is.

59
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,380
And, look at how they're
getting all carried away...

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,840
They're hopeless...

61
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,460
Yahoo!

62
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,770
So are you.

63
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,350
Ow! Ow! Ow! Sorry! I said, sorry!!

64
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,080
We brought the south bird with us, didn't we?

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,010
We forgot to let him go.

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,280
It looks like there're people living here,

67
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
so he'll probably be able
to survive without our help.

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,540
If he tries hard, he can go down to
the ground. He's a bird, after all.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,450
Oh, hey, what about the anchor?

70
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,770
It hit bottom.

71
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,780
Looks like those fluffy clouds
are the base of this island.

72
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,170
That means that the island
is floating on the sea.

73
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,130
I wonder if an island can actually stay in
the same place without being washed away.

74
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,600
Well, all we can do is
take things as they appear.

75
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,800
Actually, this is all hard to believe.

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,070
But, in any case, it's a fact
that this sky island's here.

77
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,240
See?!

78
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,110
I felt it with my body,
so there's no reason to doubt!

79
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,020
Come down! Since your feet can touch
the bottom, you won't drown, right?!

80
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,170
What about you?

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Yeah, I'll go, too.

82
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,360
The smell of adventure... huh?

83
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,140
I've never thought of sailing or
going ashore as an adventure.

84
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,040
For some reason, the sky island
makes me sleepy...

85
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,170
Hello, this is your Captain speaking.

86
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm having too much fun to figure
out what I should do first, over.

87
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,370
This is Usopp. Why don't we take
it easy for a while here, over.

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,070
Take it easy? Sounds good!

89
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,170
--Denied!
--What?! "Denied" means no, you know!

90
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,920
Look at these...
mysterious flowers are in bloom.

91
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,360
I wonder if these flowers are also balloons.

92
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,590
Do they pop like that fish did?

93
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,160
This is very nice.

94
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,620
The navy won't be chasing us here,
so we can enjoy ourselves!

95
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,360
Hey, Chopper, look. I wonder what that is.

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,130
--Huh?
--Ah! I found a strange nut!

97
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,210
I'm gonna try it!

98
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,390
What's this?

99
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,380
This thing's hard!

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,510
Hey, Usopp!

101
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,380
--What?!
--I've got a nut for you. Here!

102
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,540
Hey, that hurt! Okay, stay right there!

103
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,510
Ahh! Robin-chan!

104
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,800
These are flowers from the
sky island. One for you...

105
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,500
...and one for...

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
Nami-san!!

107
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,160
Nami-san!! A flower for you!!

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,550
Whoa! This chair is made of clouds, too!

109
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,490
I wonder if there's some technology
to make things from clouds, after all.

110
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,780
But it's different from fluffy clouds.

111
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,570
--It's puffy.
--Nami-san!! A flower for you!!

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,540
But why do I get wet in a sea of clouds?

113
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,450
Hm? Oh, good timing.

114
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,650
Sorry!

115
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,090
Huh? What the hell is this? A fox?

116
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,180
Hmm? What's that sound?

117
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,640
Hey, there's someone! Over there!

118
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,890
That guerrilla again?!

119
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,980
The whistle! Where's the whistle?!
Let's ask him to save us again!

120
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,740
No, hold on. That's not a guerrilla. That's...

121
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,570
...an angel...

122
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,280
An angel?

123
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,750
Heso!

124
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,530
Heso?

125
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,060
Did she just say heso, like belly button?

126
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,330
--Yeah...
--What did she mean by "heso"?

127
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,780
Well, heso is heso.

128
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,870
Suu, come here.

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,140
Did you come from the Blue Sea?

130
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,270
Yeah, we flew up here from below.

131
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,360
Do you live here?

132
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,330
Yes, I'm a resident here.

133
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,300
Welcome to Skypiea's Angel Beach!

134
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,970
Would you like to drink what's inside?

135
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,060
Hm? Yeah...

136
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,780
A conush's skin is hard
like iron, so you can't bite it.

137
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,750
You cut it at the bottom.

138
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,600
Here you go!

139
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,940
Yum!!

140
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,880
What?! It's that good?! Let me try it, too!

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,460
Yum!!

142
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,090
My name is Conis. This is Suu, a cloud fox.

143
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,840
If there is any way that I can
be of help, please let me know.

144
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,940
Well, you see... your gaze
is setting my heart on fire...

145
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,240
--Oww!!
--Move it!

146
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,170
There are lots of things that we'd like to know.

147
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,690
To us, this place is filled with mysteries.

148
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
Okay. Please ask me anything.

149
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,550
Hey, something's coming.

150
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,400
Oh, that's my father.

151
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,700
Conis-san, heso!

152
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,150
Yes, heso, Father!

153
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,200
Hey, what're you guys saying?

154
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,000
Hm? What's that thing that he's riding on?

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh, are you talking about the waver?

156
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,830
Wow! That thing is so cool!

157
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,960
Waver...

158
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,670
I'm sorry, I'm coming to a stop!

159
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,840
Is everyone all right?

160
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
You're the one who crashed!

161
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey, Luffy. Didn't you bring back
something like that from the seabed before?

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,270
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

163
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,240
That's the boat I read about in Noland's diary...

164
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,980
The boat that can be propelled without wind!

165
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,200
Are they your friends, Conis-san?

166
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,870
Yes. We've just become acquainted.

167
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,520
They said they came from the Blue Sea.

168
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,290
I see. Then, there must be many
things that you're puzzled about.

169
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm sorry, this place is the White-White Sea.

170
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,020
Oh, no need to apologize...

171
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,810
Excuse me for not introducing myself sooner,
but my name is Pagaya. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,430
Oh, no, no... nice to meet you.

173
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,360
Father, were you able to catch some fish?

174
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,220
Yes, I had a large catch.

175
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
Oh, yes, why don't you all come to our house?

176
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,190
I'll prepare dishes for you
using the sky harvest.

177
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,680
Are you sure?! Then, let's go, let's go!

178
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,150
Sky island cuisine?!

179
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,370
Let me help you!

180
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,780
Before we go, can I ask you a question?

181
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,080
This boat doesn't have a sail,
and you weren't paddling, either.

182
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,700
How did you propel it on the sea?

183
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,880
Oh, you mean you're not familiar with dials?

184
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,170
Hm? Dials?

185
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,300
Wh-What is this shaking?! I can't stop it!

186
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,410
Oh, no! Is he all right?!

187
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,960
Heavens! I'm sorry I let him use the waver.

188
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,880
Speaking of which, I wonder how
this sea treats those with powers.

189
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,070
Oh, yeah... This isn't an ordinary sea.

190
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,840
So he just may float.

191
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,200
--He sank.
--So he doesn't float.

192
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,790
Ahhh! This is terrible!!

193
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,120
That was close! He was just
about to get through the clouds!

194
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,650
We had a late start because you
were making dumb comments!

195
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,610
Geez, why did you have to jump in, too?

196
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,840
The sky island is a scary place... a scary place...

197
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm sorry for letting a beginner use that boat.

198
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,570
The body of the waver is
made so light that its rudder

199
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,390
can be taken over even by small waves.

200
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,400
Unless you know very well about the sea,
you can't handle it that easily. I'm sorry.

201
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,800
I've finally become able to ride it recently.

202
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
It's that hard?

203
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,740
Well, if you train, in ten years
or so, you'll be able to ride it.

204
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,160
That's a lot of training!

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,450
Hey, she's riding it!!

206
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,370
This is so cool!!

207
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,930
Nami-san!! You're the coolest!!

208
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,140
Whoa! This is incredible! I can't believe it!

209
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,210
Why is she able to ride that thing?!

210
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,960
It sure does require you to get the hang of it!

211
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,160
This is too delicate for you to handle, Luffy!

212
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,940
Hey, Nami! We're going to the old guy's
house now, so get off already!

213
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,400
--You stupid head!
--Don't take it out on her!

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
--You stupid head!
--You guys go on ahead!

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,780
Mister! Can I stay out here
a little longer and have fun?

216
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,860
That's fine! Be careful!

217
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,320
It's like a dream that there's
a boat I can ride at will like this,

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,220
without worrying about
the direction of the wind!

219
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,240
I wonder if we can use it on the regular sea...

220
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,910
Hey! Is that a construction site?

221
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,460
Oh, that's a cloud-quarrying site.

222
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,960
It's a site where they quarry out
clouds to be manufactured.

223
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,420
You can cut clouds?

224
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,750
You took the Milky Road to get
to the White-White Sea, right?

225
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,270
Milky Road? Oh, you mean
that winding sea path?

226
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,920
That's a man-made canal.

227
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,390
It's made out of the island clouds
that are quarried out here.

228
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,860
There're two kinds of natural clouds.

229
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,950
The ones your ship traveled
on are called "sea clouds,"

230
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:31,400
and the ones floating there that you
can walk on are called "island clouds."

231
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,150
Either way, they're not ordinary clouds.

232
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,060
Right. Their condensation nucleus
is different from other clouds.

233
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,730
I've heard that a mineral called the
Sea Prism Stone exists in the Blue Sea.

234
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,590
Sea Prism Stone? Is it something
to do with those clouds?

235
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,750
Yes. When the corneous particles called
pyrobroine contained in that stone

236
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,380
are carried into the sky due to
volcanoes and gain moisture,

237
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,310
sea clouds and island clouds are formed
depending on the density of the moisture.

238
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,140
Oh, I see... that particle...

239
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,420
Oh, yeah, that one.

240
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,490
We used to play with them a lot in
our childhood... corneous particles...

241
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,030
There's no way!

242
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,970
Well, in any case, there're
three kinds of clouds here.

243
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,230
Sea clouds and island clouds,
which are natural,

244
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,500
and man-made clouds
made out of island clouds.

245
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,030
Now, this way, please.

246
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,350
What a great view!

247
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,170
Oh! We can see Nami riding the waver, too!

248
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,720
Hey, Luffy, what're you doing?

249
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,270
Why can she ride it so easily?

250
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,390
--Sink!
--What are you, a kid?!

251
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,990
Ouch! I just bit my tongue, Sanji!

252
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,400
Hey, old guy! Where's the kitchen?

253
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,380
Yes, this way.

254
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,780
What's wrong?

255
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,450
Well, this looked novel to me,
so I had a little taste,

256
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,490
but, how should I say it,
this blue sauce tasted intense.

257
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,900
--It made my tongue numb.
--Oh...

258
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry, it's rotten.

259
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,960
Hey, don't keep stuff like this around!!

260
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,550
--I completely swallowed it!
--It sounds cheery over there.

261
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,160
--Pay attention to when stuff goes bad!!
--He's probably excited about
the sky food, since it's new to him.

262
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,260
Miss, I don't mean to be abrupt, but...

263
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,840
Would you tell us a little about
the dials you mentioned earlier?

264
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,370
Sure. Well... how should I explain it?

265
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,200
Oh... this is a puffy chair.

266
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,870
Hm? What? It's a seashell.

267
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,650
Yes. Please say something to it.

268
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,540
Okay! Hmmmm...

269
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
Usopp is stupid!

270
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,100
Hey, why... why... why me?

271
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,860
Now, please press the apex of that shell.

272
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,340
What's an apex?

273
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,260
It's the tip of the shell.

274
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,840
Usopp is stupid!

275
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,800
--Hey, why... why... why me?
--Ahh! The seashell made fun of Usopp!

276
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,810
--No, that's your voice!
--Now, please press the apex of that shell.

277
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,260
Whoa! That's amazing! It stored the sounds?

278
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,770
So that seashell is a dial?

279
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,980
Yes. This is called a Tone Dial.

280
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,950
It's a White-White Sea seashell
that records and replays sounds.

281
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,440
But the sea here is bottomless, right?

282
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,260
Where do they live?

283
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,660
They live in the reefs of the shallows.

284
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,710
But I can't believe that this
thing can move that waver.

285
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,280
You're right. This is the kind
that powers the wavers.

286
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,170
This is a small one,

287
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,840
but it's fundamentally
the same as the Tone Dials.

288
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,710
So, wind comes out of this one.

289
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,020
Let me try it.

290
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,320
This is called a Breath Dial. It lets you
store and blow wind as you desire.

291
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,190
The capacity varies depending
on the size of the shell,

292
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,940
but by attaching this to the stern,
you can move a light boat.

293
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,080
That's the waver.

294
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,690
I see... So, it moved by blowing wind.

295
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,290
I wanna ride a waver.

296
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,610
Actually, there're various kinds,
like a skating type, and a board type,

297
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,260
although riding the waver
is as much as I can handle.

298
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,680
I wanna ride it. I'm jealous of Nami.
Too bad we have one but we can't use it.

299
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,720
You have a waver?

300
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah, we happened to
come across a beat up one.

301
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,470
Well, to start with, it's 200 years old.
There's no way it works.

302
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,330
We don't know that.

303
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,620
Dials have always been made
from the shells of dead shellfish.

304
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,800
So, unless the shell itself is damaged,
they work semi-permanently.

305
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,620
See?!

306
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,310
But you can't control it, right?

307
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm jealous...

308
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,160
Sounds like other kinds
of dials exist as well, huh?

309
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
Is this one of them, too?

310
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,190
Yes. It's a Lamp Dial.

311
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,970
Whoa! The seashell lit up!

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,930
In addition, there are
Flame Dials that store flames,

313
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,440
Flavor Dials that store fragrance,
Vision Dials that store videos, and so on.

314
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,630
How interesting! How interesting!

315
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,840
People in the sky couldn't live without these.

316
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,570
I see.

317
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,140
So, you could say that...

318
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,550
...sky culture goes
hand-in-hand with dial energy.

319
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,360
Now, the food is ready!

320
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,720
It's a hearty sky seafood
course with sky island fruits!

321
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,030
Wow!

322
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,430
Amazing!!

323
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,280
Yum!!

324
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,480
This lobster! How can I express its taste?!

325
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,700
Hey, where did Nami-san go?

326
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,170
She's out there on the sea, isn't she?

327
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,080
No, she isn't.

328
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,240
Then, she probably went a little far.
Don't worry about her.

329
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,320
Father, I wonder if she's all right.

330
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,110
Yes, Conis-san, I'm a bit concerned myself.

331
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,800
Why? What's the matter?

332
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:27,230
Here in Skypiea, there's a place that we're
never to step foot in no matter what.

333
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,470
That place is next to this island,

334
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,550
so if you travel a bit by waver,
you can get there...

335
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,370
It's huge...

336
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,400
What is this?

337
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,920
Never to step foot in?

338
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,360
Why's that?

339
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,990
It's sacred ground.

340
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,140
Sacred ground?

341
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,870
We call that place...

342
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,830
...Upper Yard, the land where God lives.

343
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:17,730
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

344
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:27,950
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

345
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:43,670
There are days where I almost lose to myself

346
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:51,710
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

347
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,250
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

348
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:08,260
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

349
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:17,530
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

350
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,890
This unique moment...

351
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,380
What is this place? It's creepy.

352
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,260
There's a God... in a place
where we're never to set foot in?

353
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,070
Luffy's definitely planning to go there!

354
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,050
More importantly, don't you think
Nami-san's been gone too long?

355
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,410
Okay! Let's go look for her right away!

356
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,140
Hey, Luffy! What're you
thinking about right now?

357
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,480
About that God... and Nami, too.

358
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,600
Looks like we're headed for trouble again...

359
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,890
"The Forbidden Sacred Ground! The Island
Where God Lives and Heaven's Judgment!"

361
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
