00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:19,150
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,640
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,680
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,490
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,200
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,960
Vivi tells that Koza, the
leader of the rebel army,

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,020
possesses a passionate heart and will
fight to the death for his friends.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,700
Luffy's party continues its trek
through the desert toward Yuba,

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,210
where the rebel army is gathering.

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
"Showdown in a Heat Haze!
Ace vs. the Gallant Scorpion"

32
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,480
What is it, Popo?

33
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,090
Smoke!

34
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,740
Is that--?!

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,100
The tattoo on his back...
No question about it!

36
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,770
Fire Fist Ace! He finally showed up!

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,510
Portgas D. Ace! How I've
been longing for this day!

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,610
This is all the breakfast we get?!

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,930
Seconds! Seconds!

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,950
Don't act wasteful!
You've had enough calories!

41
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,790
Hey! Luffy! Why, you--!

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,340
Keep your hands off others' food!

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,340
C'mon! Gimme food!

44
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,280
There isn't any more!

45
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,280
Don't sweat it!

46
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,220
Why does this happen at every meal?

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,460
Don't make eye contact.

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,960
Look! Ace-san is cleaning his
fork and plate after his meal!

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,920
Yeah! He's completely different...

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,790
Damn you! Give it back!

51
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,880
No!

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,330
...from his incompetent little brother.

53
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,870
But you'd never guess from
Ace's well-mannered personality

54
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,900
that he has an immense
bounty on his head.

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,850
Ace-san has a bounty?!

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,880
I hear it's such a large amount
that bounty hunters around the world

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,360
drool at the thought of it.

58
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,790
Fire Fist Ace of the
Whitebeard Pirates...

59
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,960
Pirates the world over fear
the mere mention of that name.

60
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,860
Which means this Blackbeard pirate
Ace-san is seriously chasing

61
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,040
must really be something, too...

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,680
Blackbeard... The traitor who
killed his own crewmate...

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
It looks like Ace is going to keep
chasing him as long as it takes.

64
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,080
Fire Fist Ace!

65
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,020
I'll start off with a little gift from me!

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,520
No, I ain't gonna kill ya.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,810
I'm just gonna blow up that
rock you're sitting on first!

68
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,180
I have my pride! So my aim
is to capture you alive!

69
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,110
Okay! Let's get going! Today--

70
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,620
Dammit! Give it back!

71
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,600
What's the big deal?

72
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,680
Knock it...

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,820
...off!

74
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,610
Here we go!

75
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,560
Yeah!

76
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,770
Now hurry and clean up!
We're leaving for Yuba!

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,040
W-Wow! Awesome!

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh no! They saw us!

79
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,610
Hurry, big brother!

80
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,510
This meat can talk!

81
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,040
What? What're you talking about, Luffy?

82
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,840
Oh! The meat!

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,460
The meat's running away!

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,950
Luffy!

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,860
Wait, meat!

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,960
Get back here, meat!

87
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,210
Which way?! This way?!

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,760
We did it, big brother!

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,070
Is it good, Chip? It's our first
food in 10 days! Eat it slowly!

90
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,430
I can't believe we got meat!
Here, big brother!

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,790
Yeah, we never even had
any in the Badlands!

92
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,490
Oh? You're from the Badlands?

93
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,730
From that rustic nowheresville?

94
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,830
Who're you?!

95
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,710
You can't have the food back!

96
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,290
M-Move and you're dead!

97
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,250
I'm generally not fond
of dangerous things, but...

98
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,330
B-Big brother!
Have you shot for reals before?!

99
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,890
Will it really shoot bullets?!

100
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,690
H-Hell if I know!
H-Hold on! I'm gonna--!

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,130
Stop!

102
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,310
Wh-What happened?!

103
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,240
Play your dangerous games in moderation.

104
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,150
Good little boys should brush
their teeth before sleepy-bye.

105
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,020
H-He bounced it back with a rock!

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,630
I-I've never seen
anyone so strong before!

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Who're they?

108
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,660
I have a favor to ask!

109
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,120
There's someone I want
you to find and catch!

110
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,500
If you catch him,
I'll pay you a million Berries!

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,030
A million Berries?!

112
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,010
I can't pay right away,
but I will pay it when I grow up!

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,280
Please! Find this man!

114
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,620
Scorpion-sama's ultimate weapon!

115
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,060
One hit from this will
demolish that entire rock!

116
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,410
Then, while Ace is buried under
the rubble, I'll capture him alive!

117
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,410
Okay! Light 'er up, Popo!

118
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,360
Darn it! It's meat, but it
ran away! I'll make it pay!

119
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,710
Huh?

120
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,610
Why, you! Why did you do that?!

121
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,380
I'll strangle ya!

122
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,260
No!

123
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,800
No! Hey, boy!

124
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,570
Run!

125
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,460
If that blows up, it'll take
half of Alabasta with it!

126
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,000
Huh?

127
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,150
No! It'll blow the
Grand Line to the moon!

128
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,130
Hey! Boy?!

129
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,540
Yeah?

130
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,720
Wh-What happened to the bomb?!

131
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,110
This?

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,200
No!

133
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,560
You're funny, old guy!

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,520
Hey, boy! Quit laughing and help me up!

135
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
Upsy-daisy!

136
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,870
Where?! Where is he?! Where'd he go?!

137
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,860
I can't afford to be playing
around at a time like this!

138
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,620
Popo!

139
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,780
We're heading out to where he was!

140
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,300
My brother and I've followed
him out here from the Badlands.

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,670
So, who is he?

142
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,470
Scorpion. A bounty hunter.

143
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,940
Bounty hunter?

144
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Why are you guys
chasing a bounty hunter?

145
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,060
Well...

146
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,690
I have business with him, too.

147
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,490
A man in Yuba defeated Blackbeard.
His name was Scorpion.

148
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,530
My reason for going
to Yuba is to meet him.

149
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,490
Eh?! He defeated Blackbeard?!

150
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,540
This guy did?!

151
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,570
So, where are we going, old guy?

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,010
You're a very lucky boy!

153
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,110
You get to witness me, the world's
greatest upcoming bounty hunter,

154
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,880
locked in battle!

155
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,850
You're a bounty hunter, old guy?!

156
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,860
Don't be scared when I say

157
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,360
that I've been on many
a heart-pounding adventure!

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,360
I've fought epic battles with
everyone from Double Barrel Danny

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,530
to Hellbattler Luther and they
always begged me for their lives!

160
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,880
Wow! For reals?!

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,350
No, but someday it will be!

162
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,170
Oh, someday, huh?!

163
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,610
In any case,
I'm gonna beat Fire Fist Ace!

164
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,680
Everyone else but him would be a cinch!

165
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,750
You wanna beat Ace up,
old guy?! That's funny!

166
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,150
Hey, now! Don't mock me, boy!

167
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,680
When I do something, I don't kid around!

168
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Yes! Men live for big ambitions!
I have to show 'em that!

169
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,150
Huh? Show who?

170
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,950
Here comes Scorpion, the gallant man!

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,720
I dunno, Ace. Did this Scorpion
guy really beat Blackbeard?

172
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,010
I'm not sure. The only way
to find out is to meet him.

173
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,460
A-Ace? You don't mean the real...

174
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,580
...Fire Fist Ace?!

175
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,300
What is it, Ace?

176
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,740
Two people. And a bird?

177
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,320
What is it?

178
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,950
They're coming!

179
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,620
Eh?

180
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,140
There you are, Fire Fist Ace!

181
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm Scorpion! The indomitable hero!

182
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,830
I've come from afar to challenge you!
Let's fight, fair and square!

183
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,160
That's Scorpion?

184
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,030
Heya! Are you all here?

185
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,850
L-Luffy!

186
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,000
Wh-What are you doing there?!

187
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,670
I-It's really him...

188
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,340
This is Fire Fist Ace?!

189
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,140
What's wrong, old guy?

190
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,540
Eh?! N-No, uh...

191
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,510
So sorry! Your luck's run out!

192
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,880
Your heroic saga that's
told on the sea ends today!

193
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,810
Don't be stupid! He's the real one!

194
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,430
Eh?

195
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,890
This is so exciting!
Ace! It's a serious fight!

196
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,190
Don't pull any punches!

197
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,220
I wasn't planning to!

198
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,800
But there's something
I wanna ask him, too!

199
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,520
Move aside, Luffy!

200
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,040
What's wrong with me?!
Don't wimp out now!

201
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,000
This is nothing!
I'm invulnerable! I won't die!

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,620
Not as long as they're waiting for me!

203
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,870
Here I come, Fire Fist Ace!

204
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,000
Take this!

205
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,990
W-W-W-What?!

206
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,600
Oww! Hot! Hot!

207
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,570
H-He sent that metal net flying back!

208
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,270
It wouldn't be any fun if it were
that easy to stop Fire Fist Ace!

209
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,040
Oh? You seem to have some skill.

210
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,620
Our hellish battle is just getting started!

211
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,390
Popo! Compressed Extinguisher Gun!

212
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,250
A compressed air gun filled
with extinguisher foam!

213
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,810
Wh-What?!

214
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,970
Extinguisher?!

215
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm gonna use this to fill you full
of compressed extinguisher foam!

216
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,170
Sorry, but you never had a chance.

217
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,660
I expected as much. You lied about
beating Blackbeard, didn't you?

218
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,660
You figured using his name would
get me to show up. Am I right?

219
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,300
That's right. Not too
shabby of a plan, huh?

220
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,200
We've fought on even terms this far.
Now I'm gonna get serious!

221
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,560
No more!

222
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,490
That's enough, Dad!

223
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:38,810
Eh?!

224
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,490
Dad?

225
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,210
"D-Dad"?!

226
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,450
Stop this!

227
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,690
D-Dip! Chip!

228
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,090
Dad!

229
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,700
Stop! You don't stand a
chance against Fire Fist Ace!

230
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,240
Wh-What are you two doing here?!

231
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,850
When did you leave the Badlands?!

232
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,030
Dad! Look! Look how big this potato is!

233
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh! That is big!

234
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,660
We're lucky we got to
eat another potato today...

235
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,940
Just once, I wanna eat until I'm full!

236
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,610
You idiot! Don't tell Dad that!

237
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,880
Dad gave up his dream of
bounty-hunting so he could support us!

238
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah...

239
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,880
There's an incredible hero across
the sea on a big adventure,

240
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,530
so I wonder if there's anything
that exciting for us, too...

241
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,840
Of course there isn't!

242
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,720
We're gonna live our lives
without anything interesting!

243
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,790
Even Dad threw away his dream for us!

244
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,520
We're going to spend our whole
lives in this withered land, too!

245
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,440
What kind of glum look is that?!
Quit complaining!

246
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,900
Dad!

247
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,500
Just you watch! I'm gonna
go back to bounty-hunting!

248
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,440
I'm going to challenge
that hero! Fire Fist Ace!

249
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Then I'm gonna fight the world's
greatest battle and come back here!

250
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,220
The world's greatest battle
is too much for you!

251
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,910
We came to get you, Dad!

252
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,890
Don't be silly. I'm the
world's greatest bounty hunter.

253
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,040
I've fought epic battles with
everyone from Double Barrel Danny

254
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,830
to Hellbattler Luther and they
all begged for their lives!

255
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,270
Or so you plan, right?

256
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,360
You found me out, huh?

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
That's right. I'm a terrible
liar and a terrible father.

258
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,860
But, there is one thing that's true!

259
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,250
Even the most insignificant person

260
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,690
can still challenge the world's
greatest hero if he tries hard enough!

261
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,120
That's what I wanted!

262
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,010
I wanted to show you two a grand dream!

263
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,560
Men need dreams burning
inside their hearts!

264
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,030
Even if it means struggling every day,
never give up! Stand tall!

265
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,800
Live every day with a laugh!

266
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,720
As long as you keep challenging the
impossible, life will be paradise!

267
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,030
But there's no way to show that
without putting my life on the line!

268
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,310
Yes! If you stand up,
the path will always open!

269
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,120
D-Dad!

270
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,070
Now! Watch your father's
unconquerable spirit!

271
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,090
No, I won't lose!

272
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,990
Not as long as I have an enormous
dream burning inside my heart!

273
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,270
Popo! The bazooka!

274
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,800
Fire Fist Ace! This is the end!

275
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,010
Dad! That's enough! No more!

276
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,090
Dip! Chip!

277
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,820
We understand! We understand
what you're trying to say!

278
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
We stood up to hardship, too!

279
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,050
We'll live every day as hard as we can!

280
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,060
With you around,
we're filled with courage!

281
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,830
I'm sorry I complained!
I don't really care about food!

282
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm happy just being with you, Dad!

283
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,160
We love you, Dad!

284
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,260
We love you!

285
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,740
Dip! Chip!

286
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,830
Dad!

287
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,270
Gum-Gum...

288
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,270
I got this!

289
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,150
Fire Fist!

290
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,760
Dad! Dad!

291
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,350
Dad!

292
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,490
You all right?

293
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,390
A-Ace...

294
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,400
Dad protected us!

295
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,310
Hey, old guy. Did you die?

296
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,140
D-Don't be stupid...

297
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,780
As if I could really die and
leave my adorable sons behind...

298
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,630
Scorpion-sama is invulnerable!

299
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,240
Thank you for coming to get
this lowly father of yours...

300
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,820
Let's go home. To the Badlands!

301
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,040
Yeah!

302
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,730
Well, then...

303
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,200
Are you really leaving, Ace?

304
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,970
Yeah.

305
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,180
Seeing as Blackbeard isn't in Alabasta,
I have no reason to be here.

306
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,320
Oh.

307
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,140
Where will you go next?

308
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,750
Scorpion says there's a man
who saw him in the west.

309
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,220
Guess I'll check it out.

310
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,980
Luffy.

311
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,070
Always hang on to that.

312
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,320
Huh? It's just a scrap of paper.

313
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,390
That scrap of paper will bring you
and me together again sometime.

314
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,510
Yeah?

315
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,620
You don't want it?

316
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,290
No, I'll keep it.

317
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,260
It's natural for a big brother to
worry about his bungling kid brother.

318
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,370
He might be a bit much for you to
handle, but take good care of 'im.

319
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,130
Huh?

320
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,400
Luffy. When we next meet,
we'll both be top pirates!

321
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,460
Yeah!

322
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,520
Come to the top!

323
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,480
Hey!

324
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,440
Hey!

325
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,840
Huh? Where's Ace?

326
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,860
Well, he's gone.

327
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,540
Fire Fist Ace, huh?

328
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,720
We'll see him again!

329
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,700
Yeah. I'm sure of it!

330
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,020
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

331
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,090
I continue on to the ends of emotion

332
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:32,090
I scoop up my hands,

333
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,700
and the sand and time
that spills from them

334
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,710
show me that this is
what I was born to do

335
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:57,820
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

336
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:08,560
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

337
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,770
no one knows about

338
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,320
Ace-san certainly was
a mysterious person.

339
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,150
Yeah, I suppose he was!

340
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,350
Oh! You ladies prefer mysterious men?

341
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,890
I'm enigmatic, too!
My left eye, for example!

342
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,960
Hey, what did he say?
Translate, Chopper!

343
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,330
Hey! They're gone!

344
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,100
Don't tell me they got separated?!

345
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

346
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,700
"Ruins and Lost Ways!
Vivi, Her Friends, and the Country's Form"

347
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
