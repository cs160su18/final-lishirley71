2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,510
Gum-Gum...

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,470
Now, Usopp!

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,220
Special Attack! Special Oil Star!

50
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,810
Three Chamber Shot!

51
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,570
Armée de l'Air Power Shoot!

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,700
Super Fencing!

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,580
Cien Fleurs!

54
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,260
Big Tree!

55
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,170
Wh-What's that?

56
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,930
Clutch!

57
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,890
Whoa, this is dangerous!
I'm gonna fall! I'm about to fall!

58
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,100
Skywalk!

59
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,940
Let's get a move on, Chopper!

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,650
Yeah!

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,070
Super Frapper Gong!

62
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,530
Bad Manner...

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,390
...Kick...

64
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,960
...Course!

65
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,470
Bottoms up!

66
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,110
We just scored our first knockdown.

67
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,790
"The Silent Assault!!
The Mysterious Visitor, 'Tyrant' Kuma!"

68
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,170
Eep! Th-That's one nasty woman!

69
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,550
She's like a demon! She's a demonic pirate!

70
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,020
What is the meaning of this?
Would you care to explain?

71
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,230
My lips are totally sealed!

72
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,980
Put me down!

73
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,900
Let's cut her to shreds!

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,570
You're so dead!

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,730
Do you think I'm going to

76
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,590
plop over dead and let the
treasure slip through my fingers?

77
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,700
I'll do whatever it takes to make you squeal!

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,800
Sh-Shut up!

79
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,850
Die!

80
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,500
Thunder Charge!

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,250
Swing Arm!

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,220
No!

83
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,790
We squealed! We told her
absolutely everything.

84
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,650
But Perona-sama loves treasure.

85
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,770
True! She won't let that woman steal it.

86
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,400
But we even told her about the shortcut.

87
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,820
We really blew it. Ploink!

88
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,990
Of all the nerve! They're loading
Sunny with all the treasure,

89
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,610
including ours, so she can
kiss this place goodbye!

90
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,870
But I won't let her get away with it!

91
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,540
I've got to hurry back to Sunny!

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,460
But what's up with this bridge?
Why is this part so narrow?

93
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,090
It's odd how well made it is...

94
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,100
You're a bunch of meanies!

95
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,810
Now I'm ticked!
I'm gonna send all of you flying!

96
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,980
Isn't that...?

97
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,100
But shouldn't I prioritize things
in order of importance?

98
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,190
I'll... pass on this!

99
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,870
I didn't see a thing!

100
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,120
You'd better say your prayers!
I'm gonna flatten you guys like pancakes!

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,310
You won't have a bone left in your body!

102
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,130
He's spitting mad!

103
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,300
Crap! Shoot!

104
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,590
Here he comes!

105
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm stuck! My horns are stuck!

106
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,280
Drat! My horns are stuck
deep into the ground.

107
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,760
Gleam!

108
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,880
Twinkle!

109
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,540
Huh? You can't pull your horns out?

110
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,690
Hey, could that be...?

111
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,070
It sounds like Oars is screaming...

112
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,070
I'm telling you, that's just not possible!

113
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,660
He's the ultimate Special Zombie!

114
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,880
Give it a rest!

115
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,290
Retreat!

116
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,390
Yeah!

117
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,050
You guys are like devils!

118
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,180
Even flinging the guy didn't cut it!

119
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,060
It looks like we need to regroup.

120
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,690
So, what's our next strategy?

121
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,810
To stand a chance against that monster...

122
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,940
...Tactics #15 really is our only hope!

123
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm willing to give it another shot!

124
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,830
Yeah! I'm confident it would
have worked earlier if Robin

125
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,230
had gone along with it!

126
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't ask me to do that again!

127
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,290
You stupid idiots!

128
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,060
There is no way Robin-chan
could ever do something that humiliating!

129
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,960
It's so--huh? Wait...

130
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,090
I might want to see
Robin-chan dock after all!

131
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,980
K-Kidding! I'm just kidding, Robin-chan!

132
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,270
If you want to do it so badly,
you can do it by your--

133
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,520
Let's do it!

134
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,480
Enter standby, men!

135
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,280
Pirates Docking: Three!

136
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,740
We're not giant, but we're the Robot Warrior!

137
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,280
Docking: Complete!

138
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,210
Hey, Curly! Lend me a hand--
er, scratch that! Lend me a leg!

139
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,250
Sanji!

140
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,250
Do it, Sanji!

141
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,090
I like your drive! You've got it!

142
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,010
Go! Armée de l'Air Robot Shoot!

143
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,350
Man, it's only three of you?

144
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't sound so disappointed!

145
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,190
We're a small, elite force, jerk!

146
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,270
Eat this!

147
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,190
Pirates Robot Attack!

148
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

149
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,530
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

150
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,370
Jerk! Jerk! Grrr! Jerk!

151
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,490
Do they honestly consider
that a legitimate attack?

152
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,200
That's rather unimpressive.

153
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,920
Damn it! I'm disappointed in you,
Pirates Docking: Three!

154
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,420
That tickles! Stop it!

155
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,970
Now it's show time!

156
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,760
We'll make you taste the terror
of Pirates Docking: Three!

157
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,180
Huh?

158
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,920
I heard you boasted big time that you were

159
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,600
gonna become the King of the Pirates.

160
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,270
Aside from your big body,
you'll never be big!

161
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,940
Yeah, you heard him!

162
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,740
What was that?!

163
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,060
Who was crying like a baby
after we pummeled him?

164
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,200
Talk about a pathetic loser!

165
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,880
I didn't cry like a baby,
you darn puny pirates!

166
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,210
Now!

167
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,010
Sweet!

168
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,930
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

169
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,260
Well? How does it feel to have
your own punch rattle your brain?

170
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,890
Nice!

171
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,270
Did you see that, Robin-chan?
It went just as I had planned!

172
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,020
Well done, Pirates Docking: Three!

173
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,280
Since when was that all part
of your plan, stupid cook?

174
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
All right! Fall over!

175
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,950
Our second knockdown!

176
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:09,120
I-I'm not going down, jerks!

177
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,620
Robot Warrior, retreat!

178
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,500
We were so close!

179
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,880
We almost had him.

180
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,710
Dang, he can really take a licking!

181
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,840
While he's tying us up, Nami-san is...!

182
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,300
Wait, Sanji. I have an idea.

183
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,760
I've had enough of your tricks.

184
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,950
Hear me out!

185
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:35,280
It looks like he hasn't completely
lost all of Luffy's memories.

186
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,270
But he said that he doesn't know us.

187
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,070
He even called himself Moria's servant.

188
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,590
Regardless...!

189
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,610
Hey! What's keeping you, Nico Robin?!

190
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,910
Dock onto my left arm already!

191
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,450
Robin, hurry!

192
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,740
Come, Robin! Copy what I'm doing!

193
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,120
No.

194
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,080
That would hurt my human pride.

195
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,290
So you're not going to dock onto him?

196
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,920
Why do you sound so shocked?

197
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,090
Poopy! You got me worked up for nothing!

198
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,350
Didn't his reaction and the way
he whined remind you of Luffy?

199
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,190
It did!

200
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,190
So what do you have in mind?

201
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,990
When you get down to it,
he shares all of Luffy's weaknesses.

202
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh, look! There is a mountain of meat!

203
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,830
What?! Meat?! Where?

204
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,790
Wow, he's right! It looks yummy!

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,210
Where? Where?!

206
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,880
Knee Crush!

207
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,430
Does knocking him to his knees
count as a knockdown?

208
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,510
Even if we had a set of rules,
I doubt anyone would obey them.

209
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,190
Sweet! We made his knees buckle!

210
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,730
--Yay! We did it! His knees buckled!
--Yay! Yay! Yay!

211
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,610
--We made his knees give out!
--That was embarrassing.

212
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,680
We're not done yet!

213
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,450
We just have to hang in there
until Straw Hat kicks Moria's butt.

214
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,990
Hurry and get your shadow back, Straw Hat!

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,540
Why do we have to wait on him?
All we have to do is take the lug down.

216
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,670
What?!

217
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,750
Whoa, wait! Weren't we just
keeping this monster busy so he

218
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,560
doesn't get in Straw Hat's way?

219
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,090
Do you seriously think you can defeat it?

220
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,010
There isn't any meat,
and I got knocked to my knees...

221
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm simply accepting the fight he picked!

222
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,140
But not only is he huge, he's a zombie!

223
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,100
The only way to win is to purify him!

224
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,190
Right, Zoro! Work on buying time!

225
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,810
If you don't like it, start running!

226
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,150
I don't plan on waiting for Luffy.

227
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
Aw, man!

228
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,900
It looks like there is no stopping them.

229
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,120
Gum-Gum...

230
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,210
Supposedly it won't bend a millimeter,
even if a dinosaur steps on it...

231
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,790
I've heard that the black blade
is known for its "strength."

232
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,180
Once, a legendary samurai
wielded the great sword, Shusui.

233
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,560
I am sure this katana would be
happy to have you as its master.

234
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,810
I just obtained the O-Wazamono, Shusui...

235
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
This is the perfect chance
to test its strength!

236
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,900
No, wait! Luffy is gonna
take out Moria for us.

237
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,720
Damn that jerk Moria! Where did he go?

238
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,790
I can't find him anywhere!

239
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,480
I know!

240
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,810
Gum-Gum Rocket!

241
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,200
Found him!

242
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,910
All right!

243
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,410
Hey, you!

244
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,640
Who's that?

245
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,270
It's one of the pirate women!

246
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,730
What are you doing with the
treasure I was supposed to take?

247
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,400
And Sunny for that matter!

248
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,240
If it isn't the pirate woman.

249
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,410
Is your wedding ceremony
with Absalom over already?

250
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,410
Like I'm gonna marry that
perverted invisible beast man!

251
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,130
So you managed to get away?
He really is a stupid man.

252
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,960
So what are you going to do?

253
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,760
It's true that I intend to
leave the island on your ship.

254
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,300
If you want to stop me, I'm up for a fight!

255
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,860
My Mini-Hollow Corps will
blow a weakling like you to bits!

256
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,860
My nemesis is Mr. Negative
Nose and him alone!

257
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,740
Who is that?

258
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,950
Perona-sama, please run for it!

259
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,340
Who the heck are you?!

260
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,260
I have no idea who he is, but he's an enemy!

261
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,340
Just a second ago, he made my brothers

262
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,300
vanish without a trace
right before my very eyes!

263
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,060
He's no pushover! He's trouble!

264
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,810
Anyway, he's rottin' dangerous!

265
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,310
They vanished...?

266
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,820
No kidding, guys...
Of course he's not a pushover!

267
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,320
This is...

268
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,450
...one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

269
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,540
He's the "Tyrant" Bartholomew Kuma!

270
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,630
This man used to be the
epitome of cruelty as a pirate!

271
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,090
Eh?!

272
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,840
No way! He's one of the Seven Warlords?!

273
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,720
That's insane! He's as
powerful as Moria-sama?!

274
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,980
What brought him to Thriller Bark?

275
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,390
I can't believe it...

276
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,530
Are you Moria's subordinate?

277
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:04,030
M-Moria-sama--er, Gecko Moria
and I have cut ties!

278
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,160
Y-You caught me when I was
about to flee from this island.

279
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,080
This looks bad!

280
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,460
What is that monster
going to do to Perona-sama?!

281
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,660
If you were to go on a trip,
where would you like to go?

282
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,850
--Shock!
--What?! Small talk?!

283
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,770
Why do you care?!

284
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,150
But if I could go on a vacation,

285
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,820
I'd like to stay at a dark, damp
old castle oozing with malice,

286
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,370
where I could spend my time
singing incantations.

287
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,910
She answered him!

288
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,540
And the answer was most
befitting for our Ghost Princess!

289
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,330
Jeez! Pull yourself together, Perona-sama!

290
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,710
You made me march to the beat of your drum!

291
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,720
Of all the stupid...! I nearly let
the weight of your title crush me.

292
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,130
What a dreadful man!

293
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,350
Everyone falls to their knees
after I hit them with my attack!

294
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,060
Were you listening to me?!

295
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,040
I bet your shadow is
pretty darn strong, Kuma!

296
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,360
I'll take you down and give you
to Moria-sama as a parting gift!

297
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,370
Negative Ghost!

298
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,120
And Special Hollow!

299
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,040
Wow, there it is!

300
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,040
It's Perona-sama's ultimate combo!

301
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,000
I can't ask Moria's whereabouts
when you're being belligerent.

302
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,200
Where'd she go?

303
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,160
Where are you, Perona-sama?!

304
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,410
Perona-sama!

305
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,040
Hey, what just happened?!

306
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,130
Perona-sama vanished!

307
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,130
Jerk! What did you do to our princess?!

308
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,500
I won't forgive you for this!

309
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,630
Yeah, that was unforgiveable!
I'll never forgive you!

310
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,010
--Perona-sama!
--I'll never forgive you!

311
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,430
But he's rottin' scary!

312
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,270
Run for it!

313
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,510
Aren't you the Cat Burglar?

314
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,870
You're part of the Straw Hat Crew!

315
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,580
Is it true that Monkey D. Luffy
has an older brother?

316
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,630
Eh?!

317
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,590
What gives?! He got up there
in the blink of an eye!

318
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,050
Did he warp...?

319
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,010
Of course he does! Isn't his name Ace?

320
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,720
What of it?

321
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,390
I see... So it was true.

322
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,230
What gives?! Are you after Luffy?
What do you want?

323
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,410
Are you really one of the Seven Warlords?

324
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,000
I am free to do as I will.

325
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,490
That guy is trouble!

326
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,080
Is he after Luffy? I've got to let him know!

327
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,840
I've got ya, Moria!

328
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,310
You aren't getting away this time, jerk face!

329
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
Now fight me!

330
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,260
Give back everyone's shadows!

331
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,830
Gum-Gum...!

332
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,360
The shadow? I've been chasing after the--

333
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,950
Sh-Shoot! He pulled a fast one on me!

334
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,680
It's almost time for the sun to rise!

335
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,100
You'll run out of hiding
places if you dilly dally.

336
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,010
Moria, where are you hiding?!

337
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,970
Look carefully! I'm right here.

338
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,730
What?! Moria is inside of Oars' stomach!

339
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,190
"Oars + Moria! The Most Heinous
Combination of Brains and Brawn!"

341
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
