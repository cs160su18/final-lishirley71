2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Give Tom-san back to us!

3
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,730
It's all right! Now let's move forward

4
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,690
with the sun always in our hearts

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,030
As power passes through our clasped hands

6
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,700
let's grab hold of our wishes

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

8
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,100
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,980
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

10
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,110
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

11
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,490
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

12
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,450
but what you cherish most will be right there

13
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,500
And if you get into a jam

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I'll always be there to protect you

15
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,670
It's all right! Now let's move forward

16
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,260
with the sun always in our hearts

17
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,220
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,560
and gaze at the light beyond

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,480
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,730
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

21
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,690
So let's grab hold of our wishes

22
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,490
under the same flag-- together, we're one

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,120
One Piece

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,300
Your chief? Hm?

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,180
Please go ahead, Chief.

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,760
Ouch! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,970
I spilled the coffee!

28
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,970
Dammit! Stupid coffee!

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,390
What the hell?

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,020
Are you there...

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
...Cutty Flam?

32
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,070
--Hm?
--It's been a while.

33
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,530
I never thought you'd survived that...

34
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,040
It's hard to believe, but I'm happy to hear it.

35
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,000
Who the hell are you?

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,960
You don't remember me?

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,420
I'm the man who was from Cipher Pol No. 5

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,140
and arrested Tom's Workers red-handed for
attacking the Judicial Ship eight years ago!

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,720
You bastard! Spanda!

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,560
"M"! You're missing the "M"! It's "Spandam"!

41
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,150
I'll be very much looking forward
to your arrival at Enies Lobby.

42
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,650
Now, guys! Hurry up and bring
that criminal here already!

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,860
Hm?

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,910
Ouch! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! Stupid lamp!

45
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,620
--Roger.
--Click.

46
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,920
Ow, ow, ow...!

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,540
Dammit! Let me go, you jerk!

48
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,960
Let's go.

49
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,770
Hey, hold it, you bastards!

50
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,480
Let him go!

51
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,280
Ah... I'm sorry.

52
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,070
Hey! You only shine for a second?!

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,910
If I remember right, you are...
one of the Straw Hats, aren't you?

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
What?

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:22,050
"The Truth Behind Her Betrayal!
Robin's Sorrowful Decision!"

56
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,720
The only departure left today is
for government personnel, huh?

57
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,600
To think they have to travel when Aqua
Laguna is about to hit. Must be a pain.

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
Did you know that some real big shots
are gonna get on today's special train?

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
What're you taking about?

60
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,780
This is what I overheard when the
Navy people were talking earlier,

61
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,610
but these big shots seem to have been
on a secret mission in Water Seven

62
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,120
for the past several years,
hiding their true identities.

63
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,490
Secret mission?

64
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah. I don't know what they
were actually doing, though.

65
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,130
Hiding their true identities?
Then it might be people we know, huh?

66
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,970
To tell you the truth, I kinda
think I know who they are.

67
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,350
What?! Who are they?!

68
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,770
--Do you think I'm wrong?
--What?! From the backstreets?!

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,320
I sometimes see those guys
having secret conversations

70
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,570
in the corner at Blueno's bar.

71
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,030
But that's not enough reason
to suspect them, you know.

72
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,620
But despite the fact that they don't
work much, they're quite prosperous, right?

73
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,710
Yeah, that's true.

74
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,920
They often take the first-class cars.

75
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:51,090
Right? In any case, we'll know who they
are when they get on the sea train later.

76
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,510
I bet this will be the talk of
the whole town tomorrow.

77
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,140
I see...

78
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,020
This isn't working! The wind is too strong!

79
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,780
The fire isn't going out at all!

80
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,780
If people are still inside,
they'll be done for if this keeps up!

81
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,260
Iceberg-san...! Paulie-san!

82
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Nami... Oh, no...

83
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,820
I have to... treat her... right... away...

84
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,700
Hurry! Give them treatment!
They've got terrible burns!

85
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,040
Hey! What're we gonna do with this reindeer?!

86
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,420
Him, too! He saved their lives!

87
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,380
Y-You're right. Hey! Give me a hand!

88
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,800
Oh, boy...

89
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
He got his butt whipped...

90
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,850
So, in short, you're no longer
part of the Straw Hats,

91
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,270
but you still haven't quit being a pirate, huh?

92
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,150
If you're a pirate, then we'll take you.

93
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,110
--Kalifa!
--Yep.

94
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,950
And this ship...

95
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,580
You didn't take it down yet, huh?

96
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,420
Hey! Don't you dare touch her!

97
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,600
What're you doing?! Hey! Are you listening?!

98
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,310
Although it was an assumed identity,
we are recognized shipwrights in this town.

99
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,900
You should listen when we say
it's no good no matter what you do.

100
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,990
So what?! Just leave her alone!
She's not even your ship!

101
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,120
This will release the water, huh?

102
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,580
Wait! Don't do anything stupid! Hey!

103
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,350
Hey! Stop it!

104
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Don't worry.

105
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,030
I'll carry you guys for a little bit longer.

106
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,840
Merry!!

107
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,900
Move back! It's gonna collapse!

108
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,030
Dammit!

109
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,740
You idiot! Run!

110
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,740
Dammit! Isn't there anything we can do?!

111
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,470
Iceberg-san has recovered consciousness!

112
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,220
Really?! That's great!

113
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,260
What a relief! He's okay!

114
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,470
Iceberg-san!

115
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,970
It's all thanks to that reindeer!

116
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,890
But I heard that he's a pet of the Straw Hats.

117
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,150
Hey! This one, too! The woman woke up!

118
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,910
Wh-What're we gonna do?

119
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,540
Should we make her tell us the
Straw Hats' whereabouts now?

120
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,540
But she's severely injured.
And she's a woman, too.

121
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,290
But that's...

122
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Iceberg-san! You shouldn't move around yet!

123
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,390
Guys... give us some space.

124
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,680
I wanna talk to this woman alone.

125
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,250
I wonder what he wants to
talk alone with her about.

126
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,590
Beats me.

127
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,380
Ow! What'd you do that for?!

128
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,180
Quit standing around! Lucci-san and
the others may still be inside!

129
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,350
Give us a hand, you idiots!

130
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,180
Oh, that's right. Hey!

131
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah. Sorry!

132
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,520
Well...

133
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,690
First... I'm sorry.

134
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,860
We falsely accused you of the crime.

135
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,740
I'll clear up the misunderstanding later.

136
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,500
I wanna talk about Nico Robin.

137
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,040
Do you know something?!

138
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,500
Did that woman change after
you guys came to this town?

139
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,630
Yes, suddenly.

140
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,670
After she went out to town,
she suddenly disappeared,

141
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,090
and by this morning, she was the
suspect of your attempted assassination.

142
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,430
When my friends finally found her,

143
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,600
she said she would no longer come back to us.

144
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,600
We didn't know what was going on.

145
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,150
So we came here tonight

146
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,070
in order to ask her directly again
why she's leaving the ship.

147
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,530
To make my wish come true...

148
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,160
A wish that can never come true if I'm with you!

149
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,160
What is this wish that can never
come true if she's with us...?

150
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,170
Let me tell you what I know.

151
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,140
It was probably when you lost
sight of Nico Robin the first time.

152
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,220
CP9...

153
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,520
The Government's operation
was already in progress.

154
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,020
There is, of course, a reason
for that woman's actions.

155
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,740
But before I tell you about that,

156
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,610
I want you to know that Nico
Robin and I both have a means

157
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,700
to bring back the ancient weapon
that could destroy the world.

158
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,830
Destroy the world?

159
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,160
That's right.

160
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,250
A problem occurred in our plan.

161
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,550
Everyone, come to the bedroom right away.

162
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,760
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

163
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,600
Now, you get it, Nico Robin?

164
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,930
The blueprints you guys were after are fakes.

165
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,060
Even if I am to be killed, I won't give
those blueprints to the Government!

166
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,900
But if you're sniffing around
the Poneglyphs on another front

167
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,860
and helping the Government as well,

168
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
then I have to stop you right here, right now.

169
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,330
I'm not seeking the Poneglyphs
in order to bring the weapon back.

170
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,540
I just want to know the history, that's all.

171
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,590
Such a claim doesn't mean anything!

172
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,760
I told you, didn't I?

173
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,010
Over... and over again...

174
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,680
Even if you don't intend to do so...

175
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,930
Weapons hurt people despite your intentions!

176
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,730
They can even hurt those
who mean a lot to you!

177
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:28,070
That which hurts people doesn't
necessarily have malicious intent.

178
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,570
If that simple curiosity of
wanting to know the history

179
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,280
leads to the destruction of the world,

180
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,030
you should die right here,
right now, Nico Robin!

181
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,790
Even after you saw the Ohara devils' fate,

182
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,790
you still want to chase
after the world's history?!

183
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,670
Don't talk like you know
everything about Ohara!

184
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,800
You don't even know how much the
World Government messed up my life!

185
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,690
If you hate the Government that much,
then why are you helping them?!

186
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,860
Because I have a wish I want to come true
even if I have to give up everything.

187
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,660
There're two conditions that
CP9 forced on me in this town.

188
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,670
One is to pin the assassination
on the Straw Hats.

189
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,260
The other is to turn myself in
to the Government and obey them.

190
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,760
If you do that, you'll die, too.

191
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,350
Why do you accept such conditions
after evading them for 20 years?

192
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,690
In this lone instance,
CP9 has been given permission

193
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,530
to exercise Buster Call against the Straw Hats.

194
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,820
Buster Call?

195
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,490
It's an emergency order to
summon five of the vice admirals

196
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,580
from Navy Headquarters and
ten battleships to one place.

197
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,330
Once you've been targeted by the
national war-class military power,

198
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,040
nothing will remain of you.

199
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,130
Normally, in the Navy, this authority
only belongs to the three admirals

200
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,010
and the head of the Navy, the fleet admiral.

201
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,140
But this time,

202
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,390
through the admiral Aokiji,

203
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,430
CP9 was given the authority
to exercise it just this once.

204
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,770
If I didn't accept the conditions,
Buster Call was going to be exercised on us.

205
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,320
When I heard the name Aokiji, I gave up.

206
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,570
I was always able to make good
my escape for the past 20 years

207
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,160
because I had nothing to protect...

208
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,410
Because I could betray people
and use them as a shield.

209
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,420
But I really can't do that any longer.

210
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,630
The life I once gave up on...

211
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,420
The heart that I lost...

212
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,180
The dream I could no longer have...
They picked them all up for me.

213
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,140
I was able to make friends who
would believe in someone like me.

214
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,110
Then, your wish is...

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,950
That the six Straw Hats, excluding me,
can leave this island safely!

216
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,200
Are you saying, for that, you don't care
if the weapon is brought back?!

217
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
You don't care what happens to the world?!

218
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,080
That's right. I don't!

219
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,680
Enough of that nonsense!

220
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,520
I couldn't pull the trigger.

221
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,410
Of all people,

222
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,950
over the lives of everyone in this world,

223
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,670
she chose the lives of the six of you.

224
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,170
It was for us...

225
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,300
Now that I might have the weapon's
blueprints taken away by them,

226
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
I don't have the right to criticize her, though.

227
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,930
Hey! What's wrong?!

228
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,730
Good...

229
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,400
So Robin didn't betray us after all.

230
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,820
I'd better gather everyone
immediately and let them know!

231
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,910
Thanks, Iceberg-san!

232
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,990
Wait! Straw Hat and the others were beaten!

233
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,160
What do you think you can do now?!

234
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,500
"Now"?!

235
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,340
It starts now! Luffy and the others are fine.

236
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,960
It'd take a lot more than that to take them out.

237
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,340
We're gonna get Robin back!

238
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,180
When unsure, anyone can be weak.

239
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,350
There's no limit to their strength
when they know it's okay to save her!

240
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,690
Chopper! Chopper!

241
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,070
Chopper! Wake up! We have to find everyone!

242
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,400
Chopper! Hey, wake up!

243
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,660
Hey, hey, he's really
seriously injured, you know...

244
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,490
Wake up! Chopper!

245
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,080
Chopper...

246
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,920
You go join Luffy and the others and tell
them everything that just happened...

247
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,080
...without leaving a single word out.

248
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,960
What're you gonna do?

249
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,460
We'll part ways here for a bit.

250
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,550
Well, don't worry. I won't do anything reckless.

251
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,260
What's the matter?

252
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,730
I wonder... if Robin doesn't like us anymore.

253
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,480
Chopper...

254
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,150
Hm?

255
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,150
Remember one thing.

256
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,570
When a woman lies...

257
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,540
...a real man forgives her.

258
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,710
For today's last service to
Enies Lobby, departing at 11 PM,

259
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:24,010
please board from the second floor
lobby due to the raised water level.

260
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,590
--Okay, let's go check them out!
--Yeah!

261
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,390
Since this involves a secret operation,

262
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,810
you're forbidden to see them board.

263
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,480
Oh, darn...

264
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,160
You were chased after for the past 20 years.

265
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,780
I'm surprised that you gave up now.

266
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,420
Bingo...

267
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,200
We had a dream that day

268
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,040
Our belief in ourselves

269
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:47,220
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

270
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:56,810
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

271
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:06,940
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

272
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,620
In the end, we can all surely smile

273
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,300
Then, it's not that Robin
doesn't like us anymore?!

274
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,680
That's right! We'll all go and rescue her!

275
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,090
Okay, let's go! Where are Luffy and Zoro?!

276
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,550
We have to hurry up and find them.

277
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,680
There's only thirty minutes left
before the sea train departs.

278
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,180
Just wait, Robin!

279
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,480
We'll fight for you no matter
who we're up against!

280
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

281
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,110
"The Steam Whistle Forces Friends Apart!
The Sea Train Starts to Run"

282
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
