00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,190
If you want to continue traveling with us,

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,490
that moment is the only
chance to come aboard.

21
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,230
Say... Karoo...

22
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,770
What would you like to do?

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,300
"It All Started on That Day!
Vivi Tells the Story of Her Adventure!"

24
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,670
Igaram! I will...

25
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,340
I will be Queen of the Pirates!

26
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,360
Vivi-sama!

27
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,690
Oh, Igaram, good morning.
What's wrong? You're all sweaty.

28
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,790
Hey! You can't just barge in like that!
Vivi-sama is changing right now!

29
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,660
Ah... well, uhm... Good morning.

30
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes, do you want something?

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,700
--Ah, no...
--I told you to get out!

32
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,060
Ow, ow... I guess it was just my imagination...

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,060
Oh, King. You were there...

34
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,440
Good morning.

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,460
Ah... good morning.

36
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,780
At any rate, Terracotta-san is scary.

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
What were you doing?!

38
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,480
Isn't this too tight, Terracotta-san?

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,650
This is how a princess' formal attire is.

40
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,240
I heard that the Square
is already full of people.

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Really?

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,460
It was announced that
your speech starts at 10:00...

43
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,090
They're being really impatient.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,500
Well, I do understand how they feel, though.

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,050
After all, this is your coming-of-age
ceremony that we've waited 2 years for.

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,140
Under normal circumstances, this would
have been held when you were 14.

47
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,490
But I don't have anything
impressive to talk about...

48
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,480
It's okay, you don't have to.

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,240
All you have to do is show everyone
how much you've grown. That's all.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,690
The coming-of-age ceremony is held
to celebrate you becoming an adult.

51
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,660
Please consider the King's feelings
in taking the trouble to hold it now.

52
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh, yes... I heard that your speech today

53
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,090
will be broadcast throughout Alabasta
using transponder snails and amplifiers.

54
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm looking forward to it.

55
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,440
I received a report that a
battle started at the harbor.

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,460
I see...

57
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,260
Now that it's come to this,
we can no longer get involved...

58
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,020
Fire! Fire! Fire!

59
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,610
Dammit! Shoot cannonballs!
Then I could repel them!

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,580
Seriously... Gimme a break!

61
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,960
If we keep taking these iron
spears on the ship's bottom,

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,030
it'll be just a matter of time before we sink!

63
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Here come more!

64
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,750
Hey! I can't keep plugging
the holes any more!

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,170
Do something, you guys!

66
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,010
It takes all our effort
just to protect one side!

67
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,830
One ship against eight isn't a fair fight!

68
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,100
If this was close combat,
we'd have a better chance...

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,460
Whether we chase them or run away,
they'll never change this formation!

70
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,240
This is the Black Cage Unit's specialty,
the "Black Spear Formation"!

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,330
You're not good enough
to break it! Idiots! You idiots!

72
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,840
Hey, hypnotist! You're a pirate, aren't you?!

73
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,580
Shut up! I have my reasons!

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,290
The one on the left...
Where do I know him from?

75
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,950
I've finally found them!

76
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,760
That annoying violent cook and his gang...!

77
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,220
I'll sink them here today! I've powered up!

78
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,760
Now, stare at this ring.

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,690
I'll finally prove today that I'm not a weirdo.

80
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,980
Busy, busy!

81
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,150
One...! Two...!

82
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,340
Jan...

83
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,530
Huh?

84
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,290
Brother!

85
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,080
Whoa...

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,210
Usopp! Did you do that?! Amazing!

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
O... Okay! It was just as I calculated!

88
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
That's what happens to
ships once I'm on the job!

89
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,850
Nosie, that was amazing! Good job!

90
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,390
The ships in the south sank! Now we
can break through there in one shot!

91
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,720
Bon Clay-sama! There's trouble!

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
What is it?!

93
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,470
The "Black Cage" is here!

94
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,270
Oh, no!

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,280
What's going on?

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,450
It's Black Cage Hina!

97
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,150
She's a captain at Navy Headquarters
and this area is under her jurisdiction!

98
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,930
She's a real pain.
We'll hurry up and fly the coop!

99
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,360
Yes, sir! Bon Clay-sama!

100
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,160
It looks like we've
weakened them quite a bit.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,510
There's no ship that we can't take down
using our Black Cage Formation.

102
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,440
Don't get carried away.
When dealing with guys like that,

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,330
if you take them lightly,
you'll end up getting hurt.

104
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,700
Once we pull up, you guys stay back,

105
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,340
or you'll be in my way. That'd annoy me.

106
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,210
Yes, ma'am!

107
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,040
What're you guys doing?! We have to run!

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,470
If we pass through that point in the south,

109
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,100
we'll be able to escape
with minimum damage!

110
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,060
If we don't change course,
they'll take us down for sure!

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,520
If you wanna go, then go. We can't.

112
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,610
You can't?! Why?!

113
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,760
Bon Clay-sama! Please hurry!
Let's get out of here ourselves!

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,740
Noon at the eastern harbor...

115
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,260
...we have an appointment.

116
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,760
We don't have time to go around,
so we have to dash through.

117
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,530
Ahh... that's ludicrous!

118
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,210
Is there some treasure worth
your lives there or something?!

119
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,520
Just go ahead and die, then!

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,340
We're going there to pick up our friend.

121
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,210
S... So it's for your pal...

122
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm coming in, okay, Vivi?

123
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,990
Sure, come in.

124
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,700
Vivi, what did you want to talk...

125
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,760
Wow...

126
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,990
How amazing...

127
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,680
I mistook you for the Queen
when she was young, Vivi-sama.

128
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,460
Yes, indeed...

129
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,310
Please have a seat, Daddy--

130
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,920
no, Father... Igaram...

131
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,920
I have something important
to talk with you about.

132
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,890
Bon Clay-sama!

133
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,810
Running now wouldn't be like Bon Clay...

134
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,280
--Huh?!
--If we abandon pals who would
risk their lives to pick up their pal,

135
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,280
will we... be able to enjoy
our food tomorrow?!

136
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,030
Listen, guys... Straw Hats, too!

137
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,790
Listen to what I have to say carefully!

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,220
Miss Hina! They're dividing their forces!
The duck ship is going south!

139
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,100
The duck is probably a decoy in any case.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,430
Well... Actually, all the
Straw Hats are on the duck ship!

141
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,890
The sheep ship is the decoy!

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,150
Follow them! Return to
the formation immediately!

143
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Three minutes!

144
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
Prepare to attack!

145
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,510
Ready? Full speed ahead!

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,860
Am I the Straw Hat you guys're looking for?!

147
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,970
Just kidding!

148
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,160
Miss Hina! The sheep ship
is heading to the east!

149
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,940
What?!

150
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,740
You were tricked, weren't you?! We're
experts at disguising ourselves! And...

151
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,540
...we're the Straw Hats' friends...!

152
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,210
Even if I go astray as a man...
Even if I go astray as a woman...

153
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,380
...I can't go astray as a person!

154
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,250
If we are to fall, we'll fall
together into the true sky.

155
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,850
I'll make it bloom... Oh, come my way!

156
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,820
By... Bon Clay...

157
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,910
Bring it on!

158
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm humiliated...!

159
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,490
B-Bon-chan!

160
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,370
Bon-chan... We'll...

161
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,550
We'll never forget you!

162
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,470
If we are to fall, let it be in the sea...

163
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,980
The flower of friendship... is rejoicing...

164
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,960
We don't know the ringleader?!

165
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,130
Right... It's a so-called
underground organization.

166
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,570
As for their boss, even its members
know nothing about him.

167
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,670
So that's... the enemy of this country...

168
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,300
It's already impossible for us to gain
information on them from outside.

169
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,600
Rather, further investigation
will only put the country at risk.

170
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,170
But we've got a lead, right?

171
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,910
--Yes...
--Hm?

172
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,710
What?!

173
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,190
Igaram, do you know what I'm thinking?

174
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,160
N-No! I don't! I-I have to go back to my work!

175
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,240
--Igaram!
--No! This isn't a game!

176
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,620
Then that's all the more reason to, Igaram!

177
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,080
I can't just sit around and do nothing!

178
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,890
Ahh! They're after us again!

179
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,060
Get out of our way, you bastards!

180
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,890
Look! It's Vivi-sama!

181
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,240
Oh, Vivi-sama!

182
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,860
--Princess Vivi!
--It's Vivi-sama!

183
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,720
Princess!

184
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,640
She's grown up!

185
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,520
Then, Vivi-sama. Let me
ask you just one question.

186
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,960
It all started on that day...

187
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,920
Are you prepared not to lay down your life?

188
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,820
I had... a little adventure...

189
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,790
Hey! The princess's speech has started!

190
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,850
--I've been waiting!
--So she was really okay. I'm glad!

191
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,840
The ceremony in Alubarna has started!

192
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,730
It was delayed by two hours. What happened?

193
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,910
Well... I hope it won't cause a commotion...

194
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,760
Koza! Hey, Koza! Come out!
Vivi-chan's speech has started!

195
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,300
The amplifier is cranked all the way up.
She can be heard anywhere in town.

196
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,720
It was a journey... to cross the
dark sea in search of "despair."

197
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,840
After I left the country,
I saw such a vast sea.

198
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,970
And on that sea, I found
unbelievable, thriving islands...

199
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,710
Creatures I had never seen before...
Sceneries I could barely consider real...

200
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,130
At times, the melody
of the waves was quiet...

201
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,900
...swaying gently, as if
easing my small worries...

202
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,720
Other times, the melody was violent...

203
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,720
...laughing at me, as if it would
tear apart my weak heart...

204
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,830
In that dark, dark storm,
I encountered a single, small, ship.

205
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,050
The ship said to me,
while pushing me onwards...

206
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,970
"Can't you see that light?"

207
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,310
This wondrous ship, which never
lost its way even in darkness,

208
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,170
danced its way across the huge waves.

209
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,960
The ship didn't fight the sea, but its
stem was pointed straight ahead,

210
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,590
even during a headwind.

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,780
And the ship pointed and said,
"Look! There's a light!"

212
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,330
History will soon call this an illusion,

213
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,340
but to me, it is the only truth.

214
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,120
What's she talking about?

215
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,640
It's about the Navy that she secretly fought.

216
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,670
And...

217
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,930
Vivi...

218
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,580
You heard the speech, right?
It was Vivi's voice without doubt.

219
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,440
They're just broadcasting the
ceremony being held in Alubarna.

220
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,020
She's already decided that
she wouldn't come here.

221
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,980
No, that voice just resembled
Vivi's voice. That's all.

222
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,730
This is the Tamarisk place, right?

223
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,310
Yeah, that's right.

224
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,050
Let's go. It's past noon.

225
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,600
There's no way that she didn't come!

226
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,950
Let's get out and look for her!
She's definitely here!

227
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,220
Hey, this is bad! The Navy is after us again!

228
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,920
Just how many ships are there?!

229
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,010
Dammit! We're gonna sail out now!

230
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,920
Starboard!

231
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,620
Give up, Luffy. Her case
is different from ours.

232
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,010
What's going on?

233
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,810
What the hell is going on?!

234
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,420
Hey, show your face, fake princess!

235
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,930
No, Squad Captain Igaram!

236
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,010
Where's the real Vivi-sama?!

237
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,280
Where is the princess speaking from?

238
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,240
Vivi-sama is now...

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,330
They can throw pretty far...

240
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,290
Everyone!

241
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,720
Vivi!

242
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,600
Karoo!

243
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,560
--Vivi!
--See?! She came!

244
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,760
Vivi-chan!

245
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,820
Let's go back! Better hurry!

246
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,720
The Navy is right there, too!

247
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,950
I came to say goodbye!

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,950
What did she just...?

249
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,580
Karoo, give me the handset.

250
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,750
I can't... go with you!
Thank you so much for everything!

251
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,050
Who's she talking to?

252
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,880
No way... Is that the princess of this country?

253
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,100
She should be at the ceremony in Alubarna...

254
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,310
I'd like to go on more adventures,

255
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,280
but there's no ignoring...
that I love this country!

256
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Where is Vivi-sama?!

257
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,150
Beat it, Squad Captain Igaram!

258
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,820
We don't wanna see you!

259
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,800
Nice dancing, Squad Captain Igaram!

260
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,980
--Keep it up!
--We came here to see Vivi-sama!

261
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,500
So I can't go!

262
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,710
I see!

263
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,170
I...

264
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,660
If we're to put a sign,
I'd want it to be an "X."

265
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,740
--Why?
--We're pirates, right?

266
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,340
But it actually means "death"
to your opponents, you know.

267
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
That's fine! I want it to be an "X"!
Right, Vivi? It looks cool, right?

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Yes, I like it, too!

269
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,500
It doesn't matter what it is.
Just write it. That's not the point!

270
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,990
I...

271
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,820
I...

272
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,740
This will do!

273
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,040
I will remain here...

274
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,600
It's a sign of our friendship!

275
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,360
...but if we ever meet again some day...

276
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,210
...will you call me your friend again?!

277
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,510
Did you hear that? That princess
is connected with the Straw Hats...!

278
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,140
The princess is a friend
of pirates?! Can't be...!

279
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,520
--You'll forever be our...
--Idiot!

280
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't reply! The Navy has noticed Vivi.

281
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,620
If we prove she's connected with us,
she'll become a criminal.

282
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,910
Let's part without saying anything.

283
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,460
No matter what happens, this thing on
our left arm is the sign of our friendship!

284
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,690
We're going to gather up all our dreams

285
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,590
and set out in search of something to find

286
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,340
Set sail!

287
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,960
One Piece!

288
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:27,360
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

289
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,280
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

290
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,540
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

291
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,960
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

292
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,220
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

293
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,640
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

294
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,460
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

295
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,190
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

296
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,450
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

297
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,440
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

298
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,410
A never-ending journey to be together

299
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,050
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

300
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,770
Luffy-san and the others are gone now...

301
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,050
I will never forget the important
things I learned on that ship.

302
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,040
We have to work hard for the future
of this country. Okay, Karoo?

303
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,560
I'm sure they'll find wonderful new friends.

304
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,650
"Scent Of Danger!
The Seventh Member is Nico Robin!"

306
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,710
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
