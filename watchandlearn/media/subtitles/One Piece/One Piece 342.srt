2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,770
Anyway, we should try to stay put!

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,610
Luffy and the others are sure
to come save us. You hear me?

49
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,070
I'm with him! I don't wanna go outside again!

50
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,780
I'm not going back in the forest or graveyard!

51
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,360
Wha--?

52
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,490
Why, you--!

53
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,540
Someone's here?!

54
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,330
Hey, Nami? Is there a problem?

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,750
They're in the way...

56
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,960
Huh?

57
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,170
Caught ya!

58
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,310
Please let me go!

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,140
Guys, why don't you join my pirate--

60
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,350
Cut that out!

61
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,100
Hey, Absalom!

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,060
I was searching for my bride, Hogback.

63
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,750
That woman tickles my fancy.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,410
I'm going to make her mine!

65
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,080
You're trembling. How adorable!

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,570
You're so cute...

67
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,460
I won't let you leave, children!

68
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,680
Chopper! Nami! Head for the door!

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
We're leaving the mansion!

70
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,560
What's keeping you, Nami?!

71
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,810
No!

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,060
D-Don't tell me...

73
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,480
It won't open! We're trapped in here!

74
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,860
What?!

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,190
Now you've made me mad!

76
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,070
--I won't let you escape!
--Now come on back!

77
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,830
No!

78
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,860
"The Zombie's Secret!
Hogback's Nightmarish Laboratory!"

79
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,300
Duck!

80
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,390
That was close!

81
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,440
Let's leave this room for now!
Try another room!

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,230
We won't let you escape!

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,570
No!

84
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,110
"Evil Be Gone"

85
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,530
No! No, no! Let go!

86
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
Wait!

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,750
We're in a fireplace!

88
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,210
No!

89
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,210
We're doomed! There's nowhere left to run!

90
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,920
No!!

91
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,600
Where is this?

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,400
Hey, they vanished!
They disappeared in the fireplace!

93
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,950
Crap! The entrance to the secret
passage must have opened!

94
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,780
Now they'll make their way
to Hogback-sama's laboratory!

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,220
After them!

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,090
It's no use! They're pushing
against the door on the other side.

97
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,180
H-Hey, Usopp! Put some muscle into it!

98
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,140
No!

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,400
No!!

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,740
No matter where they go, this mansion is
stuffed with fellow "Surprise Zombies."

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,090
Th-This is nuts!

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,260
Gyah!

103
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,760
No!

104
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,980
The hallways are out!
So are places with paintings!

105
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,350
We need to find a room somewhere!

106
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,340
That room!

107
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,870
"Evil Be Gone"

108
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,830
More paintings!

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,340
A-Are those photos?

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,380
What a relief!

111
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,550
These aren't zombies, are they?

112
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,340
Aren't these... of that one lady?

113
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,180
Cindry-chan, the lady who hates plates...

114
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,730
What is with this room?

115
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,200
Now that I really look at her, the servant
Cindry-chan is quite pretty, isn't she?

116
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,080
So do you think this is her room?

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,090
But would she hang a bunch of
photos of herself in her own room?

118
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,170
Her face and body were covered in stitches.

119
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,310
I don't see any on her in these photos, do you?

120
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,140
But I doubt they're of someone else,
so are they old photos?

121
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,610
Listen to this!

122
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,070
"Victoria Cindry."

123
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,290
Apparently she was a famous stage actress.

124
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,000
Look! All of these are articles on her.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,630
Huh? A stage actress?

126
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,130
But didn't the doc say she used
to be a servant somewhere?

127
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,800
She got the boot after she broke some plates...

128
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,270
Going by this, that doesn't seem very likely...

129
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,810
She was originally born into nobility.

130
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,810
And she was popular since she was little...

131
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,550
What's wrong?

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,780
She fell from the stage...

133
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,620
Ten years ago, there was
an accident and she died!

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,620
Wh-Wh-What're you talking about?!
She was clearly alive!

135
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,290
She wasn't dead!

136
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,290
But if that obituary is legitimate,

137
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,300
that means she died and came back to life!

138
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,930
This island is filled with real zombies!

139
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,350
We saw deceased that truly were resurrected!

140
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,370
No!

141
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,760
Talk about messed up...

142
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,380
This place gets creepier by the second!

143
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,290
I wish I didn't know the truth!

144
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,910
What is it?!

145
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,810
Look at those, Usopp!

146
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,640
Aren't they treasure chests?

147
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,020
You were quick to adapt!

148
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,890
Oh, Usopp! Open it!

149
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,980
Open up that chest!

150
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,710
Uh, okay...

151
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,490
Sorry! This isn't where we store the treasure!

152
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,190
It's a jack-in-the-box!

153
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,460
You've come out!

154
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,050
Zombie Paintings!

155
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,390
"This isn't where we store the treasure."

156
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,390
I'm sure that's what the
Jack-in-the-Box Zombie said!

157
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,940
No!

158
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,400
Oh, Bodyguard!

159
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,980
I see some people have
gotten lost in the mansion.

160
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,360
Oh, it's you!

161
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,750
Not a problem! I shall catch them for you.

162
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,140
So like I said, stop jumping at the
chance to recruit these weirdoes!

163
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,940
As it is, we've already got
a raccoon dog and a robot!

164
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,150
Hey, I'm not a robot! I'm a cyborg, moron!

165
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,900
It's obvious you aren't human anymore!

166
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,620
At the core, I'm human!

167
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,660
At the core, you're a pervert!

168
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,450
Eh? Oh, well, as long as you understand...

169
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,660
Hey, that wasn't a compliment!

170
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,540
I wonder what will be next!

171
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,800
This is a blast!

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,890
Didn't we run into a treeman
and a unicorn earlier?

173
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,060
What about them?

174
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,690
All of the bizarre animals in this
forest seem to share these traits:

175
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,320
Bandages, stitches and numbers
tattooed onto their bodies.

176
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,350
Numbers? Yeah, he is numbered, isn't he?

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,620
Does that mean someone is overseeing them?

178
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,630
Yes, that's what I would assume.

179
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,980
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!

180
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,300
--Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!
--Huh? I hear something.

181
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,970
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!...

182
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,020
There's a ghost!

183
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,450
Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive! Ne-ga-tive!...

184
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,460
There's a ghost!

185
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,050
They're multiplying as they dance! Awesome!

186
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,800
That's one creepy cheer.

187
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,300
I'll catch them and keep them as pets!

188
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,480
They're spirits through and through!

189
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,750
All righty!

190
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,690
Fresh Fire!

191
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,530
Shoot! It didn't work.

192
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,980
That was an epic fail.
I'm such a loser this week.

193
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,540
Nothing I do works out.
I'm not sure I can live like this...

194
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,090
I can hear the whole world booing me!

195
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,630
Are you really that bummed out?!

196
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,970
Okay! I've got the punk!

197
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,160
If I could be reborn, I'd like to be a clam.

198
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,980
I suck! I wish there was a
hole for me to crawl into!

199
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,940
What the heck are you two doing?!

200
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,490
Do you think that perhaps touching
those ghosts weakened their will?

201
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,750
That's absurd!

202
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,920
Those two are pathetic! They're at
the mercy of those weird ghosts

203
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,370
because they aren't calm
and collected most of the time.

204
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,970
I'm sorry I was ever born.

205
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,060
That's enough!

206
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,650
Sheesh...

207
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,850
It looks like you were right, Robin-chan.

208
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,190
Not only do they lack physical bodies,

209
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,030
but they also break your
will if you touch them.

210
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,250
They would make for formidable foes.

211
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,990
Definitely.

212
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,700
What a fascinating island!

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,800
Gah! Those ghosts are gonna
pay the next time they pop up!

214
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
I don't want them as pets!

215
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,590
They must have a weakness! I'll wipe them out!

216
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,230
You put on quite the show!

217
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,560
Shuddup!

218
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,360
"Man, I'm sorry! Sorry I was ever born!"

219
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,490
Why, you...!

220
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,000
It looks like we can put the numbered
patchwork creatures into one category,

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,750
but those ghosts were a
completely different life form.

222
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,220
Didn't one of them appear on our ship?

223
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,600
The way they occasionally show up,
it's like they're keeping tabs on us.

224
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,780
The question is: Who is controlling them?

225
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,870
Wow, it's a big cemetery!

226
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,910
It's got character!

227
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,240
Hey, let's eat here!

228
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,120
Stupid! It'll ruin the food if we eat here!

229
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,500
No, we're eating here!
Nothing has ever once ruined a meal!

230
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,050
Only you think that!

231
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,930
Besides, we're in a hurry.

232
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,930
Here!

233
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,660
I'm not goin' back down! Are you stupid?!

234
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,720
A severely injured old man?

235
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
He's obviously a zombie!

236
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,120
How dare you make fun of zombies?!

237
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,850
Don't underestimate us!

238
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,930
Are zombies supposed to be this full of life?

239
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,190
Teach them just how
dangerous zombies can be!

240
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
What, you wanna fight?

241
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,740
We can teach you a thing or two
about how dangerous we are!

242
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,720
600 Million Berry Jackpot!

243
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,640
That's Hogback's laugh.

244
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,990
What is this room?

245
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,480
His laboratory!

246
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,400
It's almost done!

247
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,030
What a glorious mario!

248
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,790
Behold, Cindry-chan!
The work of a genius... is truly art!

249
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,540
I hope you fail right before completion.

250
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,840
How could you say that, Cindry-chan?!

251
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,180
I swear, I'm taken aback each time
you fling such cruel words at me!

252
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,140
I made dinner.

253
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,390
Oh, is that right? What are we having tonight?

254
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,200
Spaghetti soup.

255
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,850
The soup is vanishing right
before my eyes, Cindry-chan!

256
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,860
I wish plates would cease to exist.

257
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,860
Yeah, I get that!

258
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,320
But if that's how you feel,
why must you choose such bold dishes?

259
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,200
Aren't there plenty of other
things you could make instead?

260
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,320
--Cindry-chan is also in there...
--Let's see! There's fried soba noodles!

261
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,950
Or even fried udon noodles!

262
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,270
See? There's also fried pork cutlet!

263
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,090
I wonder if she's really the lady
who died in that accident...

264
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,170
I can't believe it...

265
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,220
I'm sick of these soupy dishes!

266
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,050
What about your spaghetti soup?

267
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,680
I-I-I'll eat it...!

268
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,470
I'll eat that! I'd like some!

269
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,240
What's on top of the table?

270
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,270
It's probably a human corpse.

271
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,730
Based on his complexion, he's no longer alive.

272
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,980
He's numbered, just like the
zombies in the graveyard!

273
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,030
He said that it's almost done.

274
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
That settles it!

275
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,660
He's clearly trying to turn that into a zombie.

276
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,870
Hogback revived all of
the zombies on the island.

277
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,980
That's the only possible explanation!

278
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,300
But medicine can only save
people before they die.

279
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,930
He can make the corpse as strong as he wants,

280
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,220
but it won't bring the person back to life!

281
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,060
We'll never figure this one out!

282
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,310
If we spy on him, we'll learn the
secret to how he revives people!

283
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,420
Good day to you!

284
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,960
If you're curious about
what's inside, you should go in.

285
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,800
"Yo ho ho"?!

286
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,680
B-Brook...?!

287
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,420
I never expected that man to be here!

288
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,800
Hey, Robin! Do you know him?

289
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,970
This man's bounty, Luffy,
used to surpass yours!

290
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,310
It used to...?

291
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,700
So he must be the man pulling the strings...

292
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

293
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,190
"His Name Is Moria! The Great
Shadow-Seizing Pirate's Trap!"

294
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
