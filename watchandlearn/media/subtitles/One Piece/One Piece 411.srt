2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,290
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,590
Luffy was ejected from
the Sabaody Archipelago

51
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,080
by Bartholomew Kuma, a Warlord of the Sea.

52
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,450
Separated from his friends,

53
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,320
he arrived alone at the
female-only empire of Amazon Lily!

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't let him escape!

55
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,290
There she is! That's her!

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,840
Luffy fled the village with Margaret,
a Kuja warrior, in tow, but...

57
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,840
If we keep this up,
I'll only grow attached to you!

58
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,220
Whoa, now! Stop!

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,100
I am Vice-Admiral Momonga
of Navy Headquarters!

60
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,760
Warlord of the Sea and
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,860
Show yourself! I've come for you!

62
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,820
I like the title of Warlord.

63
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,940
I don't want it taken away.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
But I hate the World Government.

65
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,540
I don't want to obey its orders.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,250
Love-Love Beam!

67
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,420
If you do not reappear in two days' time...

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,630
...the agreement is off!

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,870
Do as you wish.

70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,570
"The Secret Hidden on the Backs--
Luffy and the Snake Princess Meet"

71
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,820
Open the gate!

72
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,200
The Snake Princess has returned!

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,570
Welcome back!

74
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,920
Welcome back, Kuja Pirates!

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,700
Snake Princess!

76
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,980
Ran-sama!

77
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,370
Daisy-sama!

78
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,890
We had a big haul!

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,740
They're so cool!

80
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm gonna join the pirates someday too!

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,400
It's the Gorgon Sisters!

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,320
Snake Princess! Snake Princess!

83
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,770
Ran-sama!

84
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,270
Daisy-sama!

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
Rindo-sama!

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,640
Blue Fan-sama!

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,930
Cosmos-sama!

88
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,430
Marigold-sama!

89
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,110
Sandersonia-sama!

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,530
They're always like this.

91
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,410
It was a long trip.

92
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,400
They must've really missed our big sister.

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,310
She looked at me!

94
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,410
No, she looked at me!

95
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,000
Welcome back. Your Monkey Carriage is ready.

96
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,660
Has anything happened?

97
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,040
No. Nothing at all...

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,600
Carry it slowly and carefully!

99
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,690
Iron ore, gunpowder, alcohol,
and crops from the north...

100
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,830
What a tremendous haul!

101
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,190
We plundered two merchant
ships and one pirate ship.

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,110
The center sea people just offshore
also gave us their cargo.

103
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,030
The Kuja Pirates truly are elite!

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,990
I suppose so!

105
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,110
Where's the Snake Princess's present?

106
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,250
Don't worry. It's been sent to the castle.

107
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,610
Ran. Any books at all?

108
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,010
Down here.

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,920
Granny Nyon!

110
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,120
Let me think.

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Oh, those center sea people
did give us a newspaper.

112
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
Here you are!

113
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,800
What?!

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,430
Welcome back!

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,590
Welcome back, Snake Princess.

116
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,010
Thank you for holding down the fort.

117
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,900
I've prepared the finest, most exquisite
jewel from your spoils of war.

118
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,590
Even the jewel pales in
comparison to her smile!

119
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,600
Snake Princess!

120
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,770
A decoration of that quality
would only spoil my beauty.

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,750
Enishida. What is this?

122
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,820
Oh, it's a clay model that
children from the village

123
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,890
worked hard to make for you!

124
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,280
They must have worked hard to paint it, too.

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,670
Oh!

126
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,520
We made this for the
Snake Princess to look at!

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,430
The way they carefully carried it to
the castle to prevent it from breaking

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,330
was truly tender and innocent!

129
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,420
Oh, I see.

130
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,020
So they made me...

131
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,690
...out of mud and clay...

132
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,970
Snake Princess!

133
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,220
Don't bring such filthy
things into the castle!

134
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,990
Throw it away at once and clean the floor.

135
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,750
Anyway, Enishida...

136
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,690
Y-Yes?

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,410
I didn't see any of our defense warriors
there to greet us on our arrival...

138
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,590
Oh, well, actually...

139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,200
A rather violent monkey
appeared in the jungle, and...

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,300
It was such a savage and crude beast

141
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,470
that they all had to go after it...

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,010
A monkey?

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,610
Yahoo!

144
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,750
There he is!

145
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,100
Take this!

146
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,860
Did you get him?!

147
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,710
L-Look!

148
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,870
Men certainly are stubborn...

149
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,560
Don't think you can get away from us.

150
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,720
Don't worry. They'll be back shortly.

151
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,730
I'm truly sorry they
weren't there to greet you.

152
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,260
Well, no matter.

153
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,250
Would you like something to drink?

154
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,810
White sake.

155
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,710
I think I'll have some, too.

156
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,970
Granny Nyon.

157
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,190
This is my room. Why are you here?

158
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,710
G-Granny Nyon!

159
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,430
How did you get in?!

160
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,420
I can get in any way I want.

161
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,550
Throw her out.

162
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,380
Wait, Snake Princess!

163
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,030
You forgot "please"...

164
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,020
"Please."

165
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,850
Pardon me. Please wait, Snake Princess.

166
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,020
The center sea people's ship
is anchored off shore.

167
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,530
They've come here to get you, have they not?

168
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,700
They've ordered you into
active duty, have they not?

169
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,370
That's right. An invitation to war.

170
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,630
Why aren't you going?! You must go!

171
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,040
If you go, the agreement will be upheld!

172
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,210
Certainly someone with your abilities

173
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,980
won't meet an untimely fate!

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,170
But...

175
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,470
...I'm scared!

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,650
She's almost like a puppy!

177
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,990
Wait, this is no time for that!

178
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,820
Granny Nyon...

179
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,650
This land is currently protected by
your title of Warlord of the Sea!

180
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,110
Up until recently, this island was
protected from outside enemies

181
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,340
by the great defense network
that is the Calm Belt!

182
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,060
However, now the center sea people

183
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,290
are using new ship-crafting techniques

184
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,880
to come and go through
these waters as they please.

185
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,170
The fact that you're a Warlord of the Sea

186
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,700
is the only reason they
won't set foot on this island

187
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,020
to put a stop to the Kuja's pirate ways.

188
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,890
The island is also home to the
very young and the very old.

189
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,830
If you lose the title

190
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,650
and we return to being
a regular pirate nation,

191
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,870
only tragedy will await us!

192
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,040
Are you sure you're not just afraid?

193
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,950
My life could end at any time now.

194
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,880
Look closely at this crystal ball!

195
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,620
That's Granny Nyon's fortunetelling
ball that's right 200% of the time!

196
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,440
Let us shed light on your future...

197
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,340
I see your future!

198
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,490
"Go!"

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,990
Detestable!

200
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,030
Throw her out!

201
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,750
This instant!

202
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,580
Y-Yes! Right away!

203
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,410
Wait! Snake Princess!

204
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,120
Stop! What are you doing?!

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,080
I watched quietly,
only for you to put on a pathetic act.

206
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,590
What are you trying to pull here?

207
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,160
Your era is long over...

208
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,810
...Gloriosa, ex-empress of Amazon
Lily from three generations ago!

209
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,300
Even if this land should be
destroyed by one of my whims,

210
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,350
everyone will forgive me.

211
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,820
The reason for that is,

212
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,230
yes...

213
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,810
...because I'm beautiful!

214
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,660
There it is!

215
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,170
The Snake Princess's
"excessively looking down on others" pose!

216
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,000
Long ago, despite your status of empress,

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,800
you deserted this land
and left for outside waters!

218
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,220
You Kuja traitor!

219
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,650
That's why I live quietly on
the edge of the village now!

220
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,320
Then you should continue
to live there quietly.

221
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,050
I will not have you interfering with me,
the current empress!

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,050
Snake Princess!

223
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,860
Hey! Let go!

224
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,750
That said, I can't help but admire your zeal.

225
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,720
You win.

226
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,240
You agree to what I said, Snake Princess?

227
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,980
It really does pay to talk things through!

228
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,970
Thank you!

229
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,490
You'll go, then?!

230
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,840
I lied. Don't get cocky!

231
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,690
Get out of my sight!

232
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,220
Curse you, Snake Princess!

233
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,890
S-Snake Princess...

234
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,550
What have you done?! She's an old woman!

235
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,520
I don't know what came over me...

236
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,190
Yes! Yes! That sort of thing
happens to all of us!

237
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,550
Clean up the broken window too!

238
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,740
Yes, ma'am!

239
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,620
Annoying woman!

240
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,260
Granny Nyon!

241
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,130
Aged as I may be, I am still a Kuja warrior.

242
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,430
I have not grown decrepit!

243
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,070
My hands are dirty.

244
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,910
Is the bathwater ready?

245
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,910
Yes, ma'am! I will issue
the advisory at once!

246
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,530
The Snake Princess is about to bathe!

247
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,040
Okay! Stay still now!

248
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,170
Oh! Sorry!

249
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,060
Leave the castle premises immediately!

250
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,680
Come on! Let's hurry!

251
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,190
I-I just started eating!

252
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,070
Hurry outside!

253
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,240
Everyone who's on duty today, to your posts!

254
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,370
It's time for their bath!

255
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,670
Get ready!

256
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,210
The people in the castle are coming,
so it's about to get packed in here!

257
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,420
"Bath"

258
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,720
For the next several hours,

259
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,230
entrance into the castle
is strictly forbidden!

260
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,330
What are you doing?

261
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,560
You're not allowed past here, you know.

262
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,030
Say...

263
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,300
Why does everyone make such a big deal

264
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,330
when the Snake Princess takes a bath?

265
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,450
How old are you now?

266
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,470
Eight.

267
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,580
Then I'll tell you.

268
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,490
The Gorgon Sisters' secret?!

269
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,220
That's right.

270
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,730
You're in charge of keeping watch.

271
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,120
Yes, Big Sis.

272
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,340
Please take your time.

273
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,450
Gorgon was the name of a monster
that once lived in the center ocean.

274
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,450
Anyone who looked at this terrifying
monster would instantly turn to stone.

275
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,270
At the end of an adventure,
the Snake Princess and her sisters

276
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,950
managed to slay the Gorgon monster.

277
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,680
But when the monster uttered its death howls,

278
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,050
it placed a horrible curse
on the three warriors.

279
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,560
The monster's large eyes
were etched onto their backs,

280
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,510
and everyone nearby who's lured in
by their charm and looks at them

281
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,440
is turned to stone and killed.

282
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,600
The Gorgon Sisters never remove
their clothes in front of people.

283
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,570
And when they bathe,

284
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,120
they always post guards
like this to keep people away.

285
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,950
Oww...

286
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,370
Ouch!

287
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,930
That's the man's voice!

288
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,930
Have the snakes found him?!

289
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,830
Ouch! Ouch!

290
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,430
Let go, you!

291
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,350
Where did he run to?!

292
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,920
He went up the craggy mountain!

293
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,740
Don't tell me he went back into the village?!

294
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,630
He wanted a ship!

295
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,510
What?!

296
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,960
That hurt...

297
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,850
Hmm, what do I do now?

298
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,700
I'll get spotted again if I just sit here...

299
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,770
She did mention this island
has a pirate ship...

300
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,150
If I can just borrow it somehow...

301
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,800
No, wait. Nami's not here.

302
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,910
I'll end up drifting around
if I go all by myself.

303
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,590
Oh, I know!

304
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,640
Asking for a ride on the
ship is the best way!

305
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,060
I'll ask if they'll take me to
Sabaody Archipelago!

306
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,250
Which means...

307
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,090
I'll have to talk to someone important,

308
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,420
and since important people
live in tall buildings...

309
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm thinking so hard I might get a fever!

310
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,780
Okay! I'll just go into
a tall building first!

311
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,840
I'll try that one!

312
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,000
Hurry to the village!

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,790
The Snake Princess has
probably already returned!

314
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,590
If she finds the man,
things will turn serious!

315
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,310
It's brittle!

316
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,510
What was that?!

317
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,760
The castle tower's roof collapsed!

318
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,080
What's happening?!

319
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,240
The Snake Princess is taking a bath in there!

320
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,390
More water?!

321
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,230
Ouch, it's hot! Wait, this is bathwater!

322
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,850
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna drown!

323
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,870
My feet are on the ground. I'm safe!

324
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,930
Is this a bath?

325
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,050
A man!

326
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,810
Hey...

327
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,540
That thing on your back...

328
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,060
It seems familiar somehow...

329
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,990
You saw it, didn't you?!

330
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,260
Luffy is captured by the women again
