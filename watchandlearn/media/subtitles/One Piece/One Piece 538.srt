00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,940
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,070
Luffy and his crew returned
to Sabaody Archipelago.

77
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,070
And on their way to the New World,

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,740
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level,

79
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,000
where the New Fish-Man Pirates, who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,830
along with Vander Decken, who is after the

81
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,000
Mermaid Princess,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,380
The Straw Hats find themselves caught
up little by little in the turmoil.

83
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,430
Vander Decken blocks Luffy and
Shirahoshi's way to the Sea Forest.

84
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,100
I found you! I suspect!

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,560
Shirahoshi!

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,360
Vander Decken-sama!

87
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,150
Why do you wanna interfere with
my business with Shirahoshi?!

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,200
Gum-Gum...

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,040
...Jet...

90
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,580
...Hammer!

91
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,500
Go Shark!

92
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,170
Meanwhile, at the Ryugu Palace,
Zoro and the others...

93
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,140
...are fighting an intense battle with
the New Fish-Man Pirates led by Hordy!

94
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,890
Drop dead, you lowly creature!

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,230
One-Sword Style...

96
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,990
...Lion Strike!

97
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,670
"The Straw Hats Defeated?!
Hordy Gains Control of the Ryugu Palace!"

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,850
Zoro!

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,190
--Boss!
--Boss!

100
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,980
--Boss!
--Boss!

101
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,230
How could a human move faster
than a Fish-Man in the water?!

102
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,860
What's wrong with that man?!

103
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,370
I need to breathe now!

104
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,160
Damn! How dare he cut Boss!

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,960
Don't be afraid! He's just a human!
He can't stay long in the water!

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,670
Catch the swordsman!

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,840
Let's take the Energy Steroid!

108
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,570
Screw this! Kill them all
--Neptune's army, too!

109
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,700
Damn!

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,210
What's this? I sense a great deal of madness!

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,750
Zoro!

112
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,970
Zoro! Is he okay?! He's not surfacing!

113
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,270
I can't take it! I'm losing my
strength and I can't take it!

114
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,640
What's going on?

115
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,060
Take this!

116
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,150
Beat him up!

117
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,160
All you can do is defend yourself!
Just give up.

118
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,630
You're choking already, aren't you?!

119
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,300
Ah-ha!

120
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,220
You're desperate, huh?

121
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,010
But this is the end of the line!

122
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,470
Drop dead!

123
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,180
Don't push your luck, bastard!

124
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,600
One-Sword Style Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

125
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,570
Damn! Now let's just kill them all!

126
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,530
Zoro!

127
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,080
This place is going to be filled with water!

128
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,790
You have to hang onto me, too!

129
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,630
They defeated my strong army very easily.

130
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,880
They've got some kind of uncanny strength.

131
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,350
I have to get all my men out of the palace!

132
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,930
Here! Secure some air with this-jamon!

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,810
Oh, thanks!

134
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,310
Hang onto my body very tightly!

135
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,810
Got it!

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,530
We don't have time-jamon!

137
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,690
Zoro, this way! Hang onto the old man!

138
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,120
I hope my strained back can take it!

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,170
Now, my soldiers! Here is your way out!

140
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,970
Abandon the battle and get out of here!

141
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,640
Merman...

142
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,270
...Combat!

143
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,060
Zoro! Use this!

144
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,270
Here we go!

145
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,700
Neptune's up to something!

146
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,900
Zoro!

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,580
Ultramarine!

148
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,050
Ow, ow, ow...

149
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,420
All soldiers, go!

150
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,430
Yes, sir!

151
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,050
Ride the current at any cost-jamon!

152
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,270
Damn! They're escaping without fighting us!

153
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,730
Boss Hordy! You gotta take this now!

154
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,230
We're out now! Keep going!

155
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,360
Get through the gateway and go inland!

156
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Hey, old man! Don't pass out, please!

157
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,290
I hate getting old!

158
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,620
I can't move even a millimeter-jamon!

159
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,000
What?!

160
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,880
--King-sama!
--King Neptune!

161
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,260
Hey hey, what should we do?!

162
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,390
This is the end-jamon!

163
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,300
No!

164
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,680
Whale!

165
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,560
Oh, Hoe!

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,940
Great!

167
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,990
Thank you. Ow, ow, ow...
I can't even turn my head-jamon.

168
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,030
Are you okay?!

169
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,200
Good! Well done, Hoe!

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Go!

171
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,790
Can't take it anymore!

172
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,600
What was that?!

173
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,350
What's going on?!

174
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,950
King-sama!

175
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,370
Oh no! King-sama's been caught by Hordy!

176
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,630
Hordy has been severely wounded, hasn't he?!

177
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,010
Minister of the Right-sama, let's go back!
If nothing is done, King-sama will...

178
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,300
No, don't turn back-jamon!

179
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,970
You have to keep going and...

180
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,810
...bring Fukaboshi and the others!

181
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,440
There's no time to lose! Do as he said!

182
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,690
Yes, sir!

183
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,990
Boss Hordy, should we go after them?

184
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,450
No, just let them go.

185
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,950
Soldiers who abandon their
king can't amount to much.

186
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,670
Anyway, tie the stupid king up!

187
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,670
Yes, sir!

188
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,630
I'm sorry, you guys!

189
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,260
But I'm not going to let you down!

190
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,180
What is it?

191
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,810
No idea. Whose skeletonized body is it?

192
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,650
Prince Fukaboshi.

193
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,530
Did you find the Straw Hats' crew?

194
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,410
Yes. I mean, no. Someone from
the store had seen them here

195
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,120
but he said Neptune-sama took
Straw Hat Luffy and 4 others away.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,630
I think those are the ones
occupying the palace now.

197
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,840
I think so.

198
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,420
So they're not here. What about the two
from their crew who were in the Coral Hill?

199
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,470
I've been trying to reach
them but I can't-mi-re-do.

200
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,350
I see. I have a bad feeling about this.

201
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,650
Moonfish! Shake, shake!

202
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,020
I think something happened there.
We better go check.

203
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,570
Oh, you got a call?

204
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,320
Prince Fukaboshi! Prince Fukaboshi, come in!

205
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
Brother.

206
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,570
This is Fukaboshi.

207
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,370
Prince, we have a problem!
I'm in Waterwheel Town.

208
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,290
Waterwheel Town?

209
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,500
Men from the Fish-Man
District invaded the town

210
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,420
WATERWHEEL TOWN

211
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,840
and Queen Otohime...

212
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,340
You shouldn't have done that.

213
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,140
What about my mother?! Hey! Answer me!

214
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,150
--Let's go to Waterwheel Town!
--Yes, sir!

215
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,110
Are they gone?

216
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,860
Yes, to Waterwheel Town I assume.

217
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,370
Dosun acted too early-ch.

218
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,370
There's no point in doing it
unless it's simultaneous.

219
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,420
But that's okay. Alright, let's do this-ch.

220
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,090
Listen, guys! Our dreams
will finally come true!

221
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,550
Be as wild as you like -ch!

222
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,010
Yeah!

223
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:54,530
SEA FOREST

224
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,530
It's a beautiful place!

225
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,290
So this is the Sea Forest!

226
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,540
I... always wanted to come here!

227
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,920
Thank you very much, Luffy-sama!

228
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,510
Maybe I can treat him carefully here.

229
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,850
Mermai-do!

230
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,270
Mermai-do!

231
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,810
Sanji...

232
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,520
Oh, that's the Sunny!

233
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,230
Yeah, Franky is there too!

234
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,450
Hey, Franky! I didn't
know that you were here!

235
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,820
Luffy?!

236
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,870
What the hell?!
You're with quite a pin-up girl!

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,130
Let me introduce you. She's Coward.

238
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,470
Oh, you're Coward! You have
to get tougher, don't you Sis?

239
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,140
Yes, I'm sorry. My name is Shirahoshi.

240
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,020
Franky, no one else is here?

241
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,860
Yeah. Actually Robin came here too but
she said she had to look for something

242
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,400
and went into the forest of huge coral.

243
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Hmmm...

244
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,200
Luffy-kun!

245
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,910
Jimbei! Oh, Jimbei!

246
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
It's been a while!

247
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,350
You look stronger. I hardly recognized you.

248
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,020
They said you weren't here so
I thought I couldn't meet you!

249
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,730
Oh, I thought you came here
because you got my message.

250
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,360
What's that? I didn't hear about any message.

251
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,910
Hm, that's odd.

252
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,160
Boss Jimbei-sama. It has been a long time.

253
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,580
Oh, Princess Shirahoshi-sama,
you're here too! Long time no...

254
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,210
What?! Princess Shirahoshi!

255
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,050
Why are you here?!

256
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,510
Hey, Franky! Can you help
me with Hachi and Sanji?

257
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,260
Yeah!

258
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,720
You're the octopus guy!

259
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,180
What happened to you?

260
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,640
Hachi?! What?!

261
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,440
How were you injured?!

262
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,230
Before that, why are you
here at the Fish-Man Island?

263
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,650
I thought you'd been caught with Arlong!

264
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,700
Jimbei-san, why are you here?

265
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,580
Franky, Sanji is next!

266
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,540
No, you don't need to do that.

267
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,550
Oh, Mermaid Princess!

268
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,810
I feel like such a bad painter
when I'm standing in front of you!

269
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,770
Because I can't depict your splendor
in any of the paint that I have!

270
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,650
Um...

271
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,940
That's the way he always
acts in front of women!

272
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,240
He's okay now!

273
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,530
Your beauty won't fit on my canvas!

274
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,040
--Yeah, he's back to his old self!
--So I can't draw!

275
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,250
It's so noisy. What's going on?

276
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,460
Huh?!

277
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,250
Why is Princess Shirahoshi here?!

278
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,260
Hey, who the hell are you?!
Why are you on board the Sunny?!

279
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,090
That's Den-chan, brother of
Tom - my shipwright master...

280
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,970
...doing the recoating for us.

281
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,270
Oh, okay!

282
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,060
So he's a shipwright who's
coating Franky's brother!

283
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,900
Yeah, something like that!

284
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,780
What?

285
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,450
Princess Shirahoshi-sama,
I know why you wanted to come here but...

286
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,830
Again?

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,630
I beat him up so badly but he kept throwing
dozens of things! How persistent he is!

288
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,090
Look at what you've done.
Why did you bring her here, Luffy-kun?

289
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,510
Don't worry. You know I got your back, right?

290
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,850
Yes!

291
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,100
How careless!

292
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,320
So that's the grave she talked about.

293
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,740
She's been at that for a long time.

294
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,710
That is her mother--Queen Otohime's grave.

295
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:02,760
Vander Decken's relentless courtship
began right after the Queen's death.

296
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,100
That's why the Princess couldn't
even attend her mother's funeral

297
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,060
and has spent last 10 years
in the Hard Shell Tower.

298
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,740
The things that she
wanted to tell her mother...

299
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
...kept building up inside
her heart, probably.

300
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,250
Luffy!

301
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,750
Luffy-chin!

302
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,040
Nami! Camie!

303
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,750
Nami-chin, look!

304
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
That's Boss Jimbei who's standing
right by Luffy-chin's side!

305
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,060
Oh?

306
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,060
Princess Shirahoshi is with them...

307
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,770
Shocking!!

308
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,070
Nami! Did the banquet start?

309
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,030
--Nami-san!
--H-He's cured completely...

310
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,950
Hatchin! What happened to you?!

311
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,160
Camie...

312
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,960
Is that true?! Hordy did it?!

313
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,830
Uh-huh.

314
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,090
I never thought that such things
could happen at the Ryugu Palace!

315
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,260
What happened to Zoro and the others?!

316
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,180
I don't know. I was gonna
go back as soon as I met you.

317
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,010
N-No!

318
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,850
I can't believe Father-sama
has been caught!

319
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,150
Luffy-kun, I'm sorry!

320
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,990
I left you the message because I
didn't want to get you into trouble

321
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,950
but I let you get involved already.

322
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,710
We have to hurry but let me just say,

323
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,550
2 years ago when I met Luffy-kun, it was
harder for me to talk about it than it is now.

324
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,380
I've been feeling very thankful...

325
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,470
...to those people who stopped the Arlong
Pirates running wild in the East Blue.

326
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,770
That was you guys, wasn't it?

327
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,810
Thank you! Let me express my gratitude.

328
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,690
And I want to apologize at the same time.

329
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,490
Jimbei-san...

330
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,660
The person who is responsible for setting
Arlong loose into the East Blue was...

331
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,920
...me!

332
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,530
Jimbei reveals shocking past events as
Nami recalls her difficult time with Arlong

333
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,890
Things become tense between
the crew and Jimbei.

334
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,850
Jimbei then tells the great
story of two individuals

335
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,020
who tried to change the bitter history
between Fish-Men and humans.

336
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

337
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,730
"The Haunting Ties!
Nami and the Fish-Man Pirates!"

338
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
