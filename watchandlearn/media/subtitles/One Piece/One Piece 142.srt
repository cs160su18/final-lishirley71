2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,140
What are you doing?!
Hurry and pick that up!

20
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,780
All right!

21
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,330
Pipe down, would you?

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,230
Hey, what's all the commotion?

23
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,860
They're coming for us.
We can go back to Luluka.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,740
They're coming?! J-Just a minute! Hold on!

25
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,010
Let me out of here!

26
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,140
Hurry it up!

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,730
Okay!

28
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,990
H-Hold on!

29
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,130
Let me go, too, together with you!

30
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,810
Are you planning to just
leave me here, all alone?

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,020
Are you going to let me starve
to death?! Come on, please...!

32
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Bring me the key! Don't abandon me!

33
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay, you got it.

34
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,150
Thank you! I owe you for this!

35
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,210
"An Inevitable Melee!
Wetton's Schemes and the Rainbow Tower"

36
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,510
Gum-Gum... Rocket!!

37
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,650
Let me go, damn it! Let me go!

38
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,260
Stop it, Rapa Nui!

39
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,890
There must be some mistake!

40
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,680
Henzo would never become
one of Wetton's men.

41
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,540
This isn't something you can
just pass off as some mistake!

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,000
Our town was burned down by Wetton!

43
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,230
Burn! Burn to the ground!

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,120
If he has carried on, and not forgotten
that aggravation, and misery,

45
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,780
then he'd die before doing
anything Wetton told him to do!

46
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,570
Or have those feelings faded
over the last 50 years, too?!

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,220
What was 50 years ago for you
was not all that long ago for us!

48
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,690
Hold on, Rapa Nui!

49
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,080
You're only saying that because
you don't know anything!

50
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,210
Do you have any idea what
Pops here has had to live with

51
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,470
for the last 50 years?!

52
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,510
What...?

53
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,980
He's had the people in town
criticizing him, calling him Wetton's dog,

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,310
and yet he's put up with it, to continue
researching the Rainbow Mist!

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,980
Why?

56
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,120
Isn't it obvious? In order to save you!

57
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,090
It's all right. Rapa Nui, that had
nothing to do with you guys.

58
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,000
Hit me, Rapa Nui! I forsook
my shame and my pride,

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,290
to live under the protection of
Wetton! Hit me, with your fist!

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,180
Hit me, will you? Come on!

61
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,680
Damn it! Why did 50 years have to go by?!

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,190
As bad as I want to, I can't
hit you, at your age, can I?!

63
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,120
Man, these guys are awkward.

64
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,640
That's better. You're friends, after all.

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,430
Even though 50 years has gone by,

66
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,570
you still understand each other in the end.

67
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,180
Henzo...

68
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,990
Rapa Nui...

69
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,550
Sorry!

70
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,140
Luffy!

71
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,890
That idiot!

72
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,320
No problem. The inside of
the mist loops, after all.

73
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,980
They'll be back soon enough...

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,080
...or maybe not, huh?

75
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,410
Now what do we do?

76
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,770
Let's look for them. There's no telling
what will happen within this mist.

77
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,200
He's such a pain in the ass.

78
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,760
Rapa Nui...

79
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,320
Ow-w-w...

80
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,750
Where is this place?

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,550
Hurry and pick me up!

82
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,220
Right!

83
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,550
Y-You've gotta be kidding me!

84
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,510
Run, Nami!

85
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,610
Hey, do something! At this rate,
Nami-san will be devoured by--

86
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,940
Sanji!

87
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,120
What do I care? That's what you get
for trying to get the jump on us!

88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,650
But Grandpa, we can't get
into Ape's Concert, either,

89
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,120
with that monster hanging around.

90
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,080
I know. But there's nothing
we can do about that monster.

91
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,550
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

92
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,860
I'm gonna die!

93
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,420
I know! Miss, use the safety gear!

94
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,720
The safety gear?

95
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,890
It's something that Professor Henzo invented!

96
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,350
He undoubtedly created it
for just this situation!

97
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,310
Professor Henzo? I don't know who you are,

98
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,210
but please, help me!

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
A lifeline?

100
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,740
Nami-san!

101
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,620
Nami!

102
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,660
No, stay away!

103
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,230
W-What?

104
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,350
What was that just now?

105
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,060
Chopper! If you please!

106
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,470
W-What do I do?!

107
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,830
Okay, I've caught it!

108
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,340
Here I go, into the mist.

109
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,970
When I give the signal, pull the rope back in!

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,460
You got it!

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,370
She's got guts, doesn't she?

112
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,680
Not a single person has ever
gone into the Rainbow Mist,

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,690
and then come back out of it.

114
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,390
She'll be back, that's for sure.

115
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,060
After all, Nami-san is the
best navigator in the world.

116
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,750
Chopper, we're not letting
anyone lay a finger on that rope

117
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,300
until Nami-san has returned.

118
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,190
Got it.

119
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,240
This should be interesting.

120
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,730
Let's let her do this.

121
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,210
We'll watch, to see if she
comes back out of there safely.

122
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,830
What?

123
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,130
The mayor will now change outfits!

124
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,400
What's this?

125
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,390
Flame Suit!

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,640
Commencing element filling!

127
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,140
Commencing element filling!

128
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,330
Internal tank pressure rising!

129
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,840
Safety mechanism released!

130
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,600
I'll burn you, right down to your bone marrow!

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,490
Hey, just a minute! Where are we going?!

132
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,350
Isn't that obvious? Back to our friends.

133
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,350
Really? Do you know a way to get
back to where our friends are?

134
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,660
Nope, I sure don't.

135
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,130
What's wrong?

136
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,290
Then, we're just running to wherever?

137
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,000
That's not true. I have a hunch.

138
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,520
That's called going wherever.

139
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,960
And it's your fault for knocking
me out here in the first place!

140
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,050
Sorry.

141
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,970
Apologizing won't fix this mess!
I'm finally reunited with Henzo,

142
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,010
and I didn't even get to
shake his hand, you know?

143
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,940
I'll never get back to Luluka now, either.

144
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,620
Damn it!

145
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm going to die here in
this mist, just like my dad did.

146
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,580
Your dad?

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,680
My dad was an officer in the navy.
When I was still a little kid,

148
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
he left on a long journey to explore
some unknown area of the seas.

149
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,070
I'd been waiting, ever since,
for my dad to come back.

150
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,000
Even now, Dad was off having
adventures at sea somewhere.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,140
That's what I believed. But then...

152
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,220
Dad! Dad!

153
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,700
I frantically searched the ship,
but I didn't find Dad anywhere.

154
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,100
We're not getting out of here alive, all right.

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,360
We're going to be shut up
inside this mist forever.

156
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,310
Hey, where are you going?

157
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,190
I told you, back to where our friends are.

158
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,200
But how?! We don't even know where we are!

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,990
And yet, you're still going to keep
moving forward through this mist?!

160
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,890
If we don't keep moving,

161
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,970
we'll never get back to
where everyone is, right?

162
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,920
How's your end?

163
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,470
No good. I didn't see them anywhere.

164
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,040
It's possible that both of them might
have been flung beyond the mist.

165
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,870
What do you mean?
Rapa Nui isn't here anymore?

166
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,340
Quite possibly.

167
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,780
Oh, no...

168
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,590
That is a galleon, from 200 years ago.

169
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,130
I've never seen that ship before.

170
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,780
It's possible that inside Ape's Concert,

171
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,620
the course of time itself is...

172
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,280
Hey! Guys!

173
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,090
Oh, it's you, Nami.

174
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,220
What do you mean, "oh, it's you"?!

175
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,560
And after I came all the way
here just to rescue you!

176
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,050
How rude of you!

177
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,340
You aren't the least bit convincing.

178
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,230
Pay no mind, pay no mind.

179
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,930
Huh? Who are these children?
Where did Luffy go?

180
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,810
What's the matter? You all look so glum.

181
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,570
Has something happened?

182
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,530
They're gone beyond the mist.

183
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,200
Huh?

184
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,650
Like I said, they're gone.
They're not here anymore.

185
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,410
What do you mean?

186
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,190
Just what he said.

187
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,210
You weren't here for it, so there's
no way to explain it to you.

188
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,620
Okay. We're withdrawing!

189
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,910
Just a minute!

190
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,660
What about Luffy?!

191
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,930
I'm not sure what happened,
but there's no way he's dead, is there?

192
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,380
Just leave him be, no problem.

193
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,960
Come on, we're heading back!

194
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,530
Is there a way to escape?

195
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,230
Of a sort.

196
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,300
That's just a rope, isn't it?!

197
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,590
You're the one who came from Luluka, are you?

198
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,280
Ian!

199
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,910
Who's this guy?

200
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,120
One of Wetton's buddies.

201
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,080
What is that guy doing in here?

202
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,290
Why don't you hand over that rope to me?

203
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,590
Why should I? If you want
to get out of the mist, too,

204
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,740
you can just come along with us, right?

205
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,360
Don't you care what happens to him?

206
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,020
No, I don't.

207
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,370
What?!

208
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,270
Who is that kid, anyway? I'm not
good-natured enough to help out

209
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,100
a kid I've never even seen before.

210
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,810
Yeah, can't argue with that.

211
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,060
What?! You jackass! I'll shoot him! I really will!

212
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,510
You murderer!

213
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,410
Do what he says!

214
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,510
Who, me? That's silly--

215
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,360
H-Hey, cut that out!

216
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,870
I don't want to lose any more of my friends!

217
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,650
Please, do what he says!

218
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,330
Nice, Isoka-chan! While you're at it,
attach that lifeline to the boat.

219
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,340
Isoka-chan, why don't you come with me?

220
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,250
With this much treasure,
we'll never have to work again.

221
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Don't get me wrong!
Rapa Nui is the only leader we have!

222
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,270
I have no intention of following
a pantywaist like you!

223
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,720
What?!

224
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,370
Run, Isoka!

225
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,350
Damn you!

226
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,090
Rongo!

227
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,570
Mess with me, will you?!

228
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,860
Stop!

229
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,160
Damn it, let go! Let me go!

230
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,920
Hey, what's the matter?

231
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,220
Sea Prism Stone...

232
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,310
What?!

233
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,300
Damn it!

234
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,410
Hold it, you bastard!

235
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,620
Don't you dare miss!

236
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,970
Hurry up and shoot! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

237
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,640
W-Wait, let me aim, let me aim, let me aim!

238
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,580
I can't shoot, you know!

239
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,120
Burn! Burn!

240
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,220
It's no use! I can't get out of the way like this!

241
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,360
Rumble!!

242
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,520
Lake, there he goes!

243
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,860
Electroshock Suit! Maximum output!

244
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,540
You're not getting away!

245
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,830
Dragon Spark!!

246
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,650
Chopper!

247
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,950
You shouldn't take your
eyes off your opponent!

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,460
What is this?!

249
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,710
Silver Barbecue!!

250
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,370
B-Barbecue?!

251
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,940
Shoot your mouth off, will you?

252
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,140
You're an example of what we call
"not knowing your place."

253
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,940
Grandpa, it's pulling, it's pulling!

254
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,270
You mean, that girl is really
coming back from inside the mist?

255
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,200
Hey, pull her back here!

256
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,690
Right!

257
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,390
Not yet.

258
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,540
What?

259
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,210
I promised that until Nami came back,

260
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,530
no one was going to lay a finger on this rope!

261
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't make me laugh!

262
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,550
To hell with your promise!
You're just being petty and stubborn!

263
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,670
Is that how badly you want the treasure?!

264
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,410
We don't want that.

265
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,620
Nami-san will be coming back,
you can count on it.

266
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,090
We're just guarding the spot
of her return with our lives.

267
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,120
Joue Shoot!!

268
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,700
This play at friendship disgusts me!

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,370
Mayor! There's a boat coming back!

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,370
All right, pull the rope. Lead it over here.

271
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,770
You kids are idiots! You can just
live inside this mist forever!

272
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,730
Oh, it sure feels good, being under a blue sky!

273
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,700
Oh, I see it, I see it! The town of Luluka!

274
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,370
I-Is that...?

275
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
That's not Nami...!

276
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,230
W-Who are you?

277
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,680
Sorry to be away so long! I am Ian!

278
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,430
Captain Wetton, you are
looking even better than ever!

279
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,660
M-Me?

280
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,350
I am doing very well, yes.

281
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,400
Ian? Ian, you say?

282
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,160
The same Ian that was under me?

283
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,210
Huh? Captain, who is this geezer?

284
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,950
Uh, well, see...

285
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,790
I'm the captain! I'm Wetton!

286
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,550
Eh? Then, who's this?

287
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,650
My grandson, Lake.

288
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,310
His son, Flip.

289
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,890
You're kidding! You're that
bed-wetting pipsqueak Flip?

290
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,560
You've even got a kid of your own now?!
That's absolutely astounding!

291
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,760
Stop laughing, I say! Stop laughing!

292
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,900
Tell me, Ian, what it's like inside the mist.

293
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,740
Y-Yes, sir.

294
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,640
Here, drink up.

295
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,690
Wow, thanks!

296
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,260
Well?

297
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,200
It's no use, I can't get through.

298
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,630
When the signal got through before,

299
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,530
it must have been a temporary thing.

300
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,350
Of all the bad luck.

301
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,500
To have a piece of jewelry with
a Sea Prism Stone in it there...

302
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,230
Sea Prism Stone?

303
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,710
It's a sea crystal. It has the power
to cancel out Devil Fruit abilities.

304
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,550
Aw, there's no point in
having this much treasure

305
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,180
if we can't even go outside of here with it.

306
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,020
You're a navigator, right? Do something.

307
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,900
Nothing I can do. This absurd
area of the sea is a first for me.

308
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,560
We've got no options, huh?

309
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,900
No, he'll be coming back.

310
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,240
What for?

311
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,610
Wetton's ultimate goal is the
treasure inside Ape's Concert.

312
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,030
Now that his man Ian has returned alive,

313
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,140
he'll be heading up a large
force and charging in here.

314
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,580
You've gotta be kidding me!

315
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,580
Let's fight! I won't hand over
this treasure to anyone!

316
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,860
Listen to you...

317
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,150
If only Rapa Nui were here for us...

318
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,970
Hey, buck up! Hey!

319
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,960
Damn!

320
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,520
It's no good! No matter how much we paddle,

321
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,990
we wind up back where we started!

322
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,800
It really is impossible.
We can't get out of this mist.

323
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,550
That's not so bad, is it?

324
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,870
We're the only ones in here.
We can sleep when we want,

325
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,590
and play when we want. It's our own paradise.

326
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,810
A land of freedom, a land of eternity!

327
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,170
Rapa Nui!

328
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,060
We don't have to go home.
Let's make our own land, all on our own.

329
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,340
I want to go home, back to our own town.

330
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,080
I want to go home to Luluka.

331
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,950
Dad?

332
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,510
Dad... Dad!

333
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,130
What's that light?

334
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,090
Hey, isn't that...?

335
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,350
An exit!

336
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,580
At last, my 50-year-old dream will come true.

337
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,370
The Rainbow Mist and this world
will be forever joined!

338
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,350
W-What's that?!

339
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,450
Everyone, grab onto something!

340
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,410
W-What's that?!

341
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,360
It's Rainbow Tower!

342
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,650
Whew, that was a close one!

343
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
Here's your hat.

344
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,340
Thank you. By the way, what is that?

345
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,160
They're planning to invade Ape's Concert.

346
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,870
Huh? They who?

347
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,190
In any case, let's hurry. Everyone's in danger!

348
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,110
So, Wetton, you've come after all.

349
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,360
Get going, men!

350
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,280
Take every last bit of Ape's Concert's treasures!

351
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:17,520
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

352
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:27,570
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

353
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,500
There are days where I almost lose to myself

354
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,930
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

355
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,060
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

356
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:08,400
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

357
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:17,660
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

358
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,790
This unique moment...

359
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,060
Wetton is here!

360
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,710
But this is the mayor we're facing, right?

361
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,070
He has a lot of men under him.

362
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,540
I've fought him all this time by myself,

363
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,420
and I haven't given my heart over to him.

364
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,430
Aren't you forgetting about us?
You're not alone.

365
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,330
I won't let you defile the
paradise of the Pumpkin Pirates!

366
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,010
On the next episode of One Piece!

367
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,270
"And So, the Legend Begins!
To the Other Side of the Rainbow"

368
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
