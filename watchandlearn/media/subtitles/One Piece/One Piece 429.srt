2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,110
Luffy and others had been captured by Largo,

50
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,440
captain of the Amigo Pirates,
with his Net-Net power.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,120
Even if you are a rubberman, I will
not let you get away with it, senor!

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,360
But Boss, the big beetle, tried to
sacrifice himself to save the island...

53
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,710
Wait!

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,630
Can't you hear what I'm saying!

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,100
Boss, after shedding his skin,

56
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,440
then cut down the nets which
held Luffy and the others.

57
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,330
Oh no! It was too soon to
shed his skin as I thought!

58
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,550
Crying or screaming won't help anymore!

59
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,830
We got your guardian angel as you see!

60
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,800
It's not over yet!

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,470
We won't let his last breath...

62
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,540
...be wasted.

63
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,310
Thank you, Giant Beetle!

64
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,940
Now, it's showtime!

65
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,020
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
Luffy vs. Largo The Battle is on!"

66
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,460
What can three burned men

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,010
and some weak sea idiots
with pathetic weapons do...

68
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,090
...at this last moment?!

69
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,310
It's obvious! We want the Giant Beetle!

70
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,680
Boss!

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,270
Give him back!

72
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,490
Thank you!

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,740
Go ahead, make my day!

74
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,480
Zoro! Cut that net!

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,450
Okay.

76
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,530
How stupid are you?

77
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,540
You know that your sword
is too dull to cut my net.

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,000
We'll see about that!

79
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,600
Lion Strike!

80
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,690
No way!

81
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,140
We gotta fight, too!

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,310
Wait a minute!

83
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,480
Second Gear!

84
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,320
Sanji! Shoot me over there!

85
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,530
Alright!

86
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,160
Get ready, Net Man!

87
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,370
Why should I?

88
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,160
Armee de L'Air Assault Gum Shoot!

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,960
Jet Bullet!

90
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,000
Get the rest!

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,340
Alright!

92
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,010
Big Bro got taken down?

93
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,950
No, he was just off-guard! He can't
have been beaten by that kid!

94
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,600
To be recognized by Big Boss Shiki...

95
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,650
Did you get hurt, maybe a bit?

96
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,700
Now I remember!

97
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,200
That straw hat!

98
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,480
You have a 300 million
berry price on your head...

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,000
You're Monkey D. Luffy, aren't you?

100
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,290
Yes, I am!

101
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,620
It's hard for me to take a young man's life

102
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,800
but the sweet sound of your death
cry will be worth 300 million to me.

103
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,940
Mucho Burning Net!

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,510
Gum-Gum...

105
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,060
...Jet Lance!

106
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,350
Mucho Sticky Net!

107
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,690
The jungle is a poor place to
fight! I need to get out of here!

108
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,340
Bastard! He's running away!

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,950
Of course!  That's why
they call it "weak sea!"

110
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,420
People from the East Blue
are quick at running away!

111
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,940
No. A smart lady from the
East Blue figured that...

112
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,600
...two of us are enough to beat you all.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,850
Hey! Why are we running?!

114
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,290
We're all ready to kick their butt!

115
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,950
Ouch! Don't be stupid!

116
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,460
You can't confront them!

117
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,400
He's right!

118
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,390
You can only do what you are
capable of at times like these...

119
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,370
...even if that means using your brain!

120
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,340
You! Hurry up!

121
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,160
Don't tell me what to do, Pirate!

122
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,470
Do you want them to have
the beetle and the island?!

123
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,550
If not, you have to do as I say!

124
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,500
Are you sure...

125
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,060
Are you sure that I'll get Boss
back if I go along with you?!

126
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,600
Yes!

127
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,950
Are you ready now?!

128
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,830
Yeah!

129
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,580
We're all in agreement?!

130
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,250
Yeah!

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,830
You two are enough for us?

132
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,510
What a big mouth!

133
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,120
The only thing they've got going
for them is their numbers.

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,260
Do you want me to protect you?

135
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,140
Are you kidding me?  You
just watch your own ass!

136
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,020
Guys! Let's...

137
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,690
...Get them!

138
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,730
--Ouch!
--W-What happened?!

139
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,190
Don't mess with us!

140
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,740
Fool! Aw!

141
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,830
Get out of here!

142
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,560
What are they doing?!

143
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,580
Take that!

144
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,800
Surprised?

145
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,300
The caves here are all connected
to different parts of the island.

146
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a waste to just use them as an
escape route for when an enemy comes!

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,100
Alright! Get down, everybody!

148
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,230
Thunder Bolt...

149
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,400
...Tempo!

150
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,860
Oh no!

151
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,030
Let's get them all at once!

152
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,210
What's going on here?!

153
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,040
Stop it!

154
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,170
Sure-Kill Egg Star!

155
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,260
Augh! It stinks!

156
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,510
Nice!

157
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,020
They're great!

158
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,450
You think you can make a fool out of me?!

159
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,760
You can't get away with it!

160
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,870
What the hell?!

161
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,580
I'll kill you all!

162
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,460
Oh no!

163
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,680
Boss!

164
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,600
Screw you!

165
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,350
Out of bullets?!

166
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,460
What have you done?!

167
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,440
As a requiem for my brother,

168
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,830
I will take your life!

169
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,030
Here on the beach, with an expansive view,

170
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,330
you'll find it hard to elude me, I'm sure!

171
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,840
Oh yeah? But I'm sure you can't beat me!

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,590
How stupid you are!

173
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,300
Bring it on, senor!

174
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,220
Oh? What's going on there?!

175
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,850
--It's Luffy!
--Seems like he's fighting.

176
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,810
Jet Pistol!

177
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,070
No shock! Net Body!

178
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,030
W-What's that?!

179
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,800
Sorry! Your attack won't hurt me anymore!

180
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,370
Gum-Gum...

181
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,040
...Jet Gatling!

182
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,840
It's not working! How long
are you going to do that?!

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,300
Until you get blown away!

184
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,050
Luffy's attack isn't working!
He must be a Devil Fruit eater!

185
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,050
That's not good.

186
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,600
Alright, let's finish it up.

187
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,850
This is for my brother!
A requiem of a death cry!

188
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,940
Mucho-Mucho...

189
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,570
...Full Net Body!

190
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,870
--Luffy!
--Luffy-san!

191
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,790
Now, you're captured!

192
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,410
You will never break this net!

193
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,260
What now?!

194
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,110
It's a submarine, isn't it?

195
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,710
It's being used as a pirate ship?!

196
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,940
Looks like it.

197
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,490
Now, I have a prize worth
300 million berries!

198
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,150
Third Gear!

199
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,280
Bone Balloon!

200
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,200
W-What are you...?!

201
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,580
Stop it!

202
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,860
Gum-Gum...

203
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,400
...Giant Pistol!

204
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,020
Oh no!

205
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,440
Augh! Luffy!

206
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,680
I got it!

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,650
I'm coming to save you, Luffy-san!

208
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,030
What?

209
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,610
Oh, wait--I seem to have
forgotten I can't swim!

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,500
I thought I'd die here!

211
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,540
Even though I'm already dead!

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,590
Thank you, Giant Beetle!

213
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,930
Ow, ow, ouch! What do
you think you're doing?!

214
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,280
You bastard! A few minutes ago,
you could barely breathe fire!

215
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,960
I can't take it! Let's fight right now!

216
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,360
No! Wait until I get down!

217
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,060
Ah no!

218
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,630
Ow, ow, ow... You bastard!

219
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,980
--Those two...
--Ow, nice one!

220
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,530
are they gonna fight forever?

221
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,750
Dunno.

222
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,030
You haven't won yet!

223
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,290
Dad...

224
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,010
There you are.

225
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,540
Can I join?

226
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,150
Why are you here?

227
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,320
I heard there was an orange plantation so...

228
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,110
What a view!

229
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,120
My dad used to love this place.

230
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,750
And so did I.

231
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,650
Look, Yoko! This is my favorite
place in the whole world!

232
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,050
Yeah! I love this place, too!

233
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,030
I really really love it!

234
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,390
Yeah? You really love it?

235
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,020
Burn everything up!

236
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,640
Take all the treasure and food!

237
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,690
Kill all who resist!

238
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,110
Dad! Dad!

239
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,710
Yoko!

240
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,620
Hurry and escape from this island!

241
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,000
No I won't! Because I love this island!

242
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,420
I love the view from the orange plantation!

243
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,260
You said that you love it, too!

244
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,740
You're right.

245
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,070
You save...

246
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,530
...t-this island from now on.

247
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,120
Dad!

248
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,310
Together with the island...

249
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,670
...live strongly!

250
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,750
I was like you.

251
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,260
I really hated pirates.

252
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,890
What?

253
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,470
Then, why did you become one?

254
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,660
Well... I'm not sure why.

255
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,170
Nami!

256
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,260
You're one of us now!

257
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,720
Uh-huh!

258
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,730
But Luffy is not the kind of
pirate that you think he is.

259
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,740
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

260
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,990
Let's make it clear which
one of us is stronger!

261
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,580
Shut up! I don't care!

262
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,040
I just wanna fight him!

263
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,090
Is that it?!

264
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,630
Yeah, I think I see what you mean.

265
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,930
Yeah?

266
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,820
Uh-huh.

267
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,930
He's too stupid and naive to be a pirate.

268
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,390
I agree.

269
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,150
It's quiet. Did they finish fighting?

270
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,940
Oh yeah.

271
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,900
I wonder how Boss did.

272
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,080
What do you say? Do you give up?

273
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,480
He says "No, I won!"

274
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,780
What?!

275
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,700
Alright, that's it!

276
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,550
It's time to go back to the sea!

277
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,200
What're you talking about, Nami?!

278
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,050
We're not through yet!

279
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,890
It seems like it only takes a half day to
record the magnetic wave of this island.

280
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,230
So we better go now before it resets.

281
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,700
Nami-sama!

282
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,350
Luffy!

283
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,140
Thank you for saving our island!

284
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,100
No problem!

285
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,990
Giant Beetle! I'll be back someday so,

286
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,990
let's continue where we left off!

287
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,730
Promise me!

288
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,530
I thought that they were
specialists in trapping.

289
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,750
But I'm afraid we've lost
touch with the Amigo Pirates.

290
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,480
It seems as though it was
impossible for them to defeat

291
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,000
the monster that you created.

292
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,260
However, one escapee doesn't affect
the execution of my plan at all.

293
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,060
These monsters will help
me to conquer the world!

294
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's declare war against the whole world!

295
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,070
Shiki the Golden Lion's
supreme plan will begin!

296
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,950
Luffy and the others defeat the
Basilisk and press on through level 2,

297
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,920
but more wild beasts impede
their path one after another.

298
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,590
Meanwhile, another pirate is being
held in the same prison cell as Ace.

299
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,680
His name is...

300
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,290
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,100
"A Warlord in Prison!
Jimbei the First Son of the Sea!"

302
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
