00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,500
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,560
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,410
I can't stand still, I can't stop

Make waves, jump from your sleep

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,260
If you want to go to
the unbelievable world

Freedom is our only rule

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,990
It's not our way to worry

The sun of my heart will never set

60
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,340
One, two, Sunshine

61

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,970
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,470
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned

74
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,750
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,360
After a fierce battle on Punk Hazard,

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,380
the Straw Hats along with their pirate ally -
the Warlord - Law...

79
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,620
...finally captured Caesar and

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,540
headed out for their next destination - Dressrosa.

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,970
Let's negotiate.

82
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,940
Resign from the Seven Warlords.

83
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm expecting to see it in the newspaper
tomorrow morning.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
Goodbye.

85
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Clank.

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,150
Wait a minute! Law!

87
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,870
Damn squirt!

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,460
We found you!

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,590
"Caesar Goes Missing!
The Pirate Alliance Makes a Sortie!"

90
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,510
Doflamingo! I know he's gonna make

91
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,620
a raid in the darkness of the night!

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,280
Just bring it on! I mean, don't!

93
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,740
I-I can't sleep!

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,140
Calm all the way to the horizon!

95
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,980
Go.

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,710
--What's that?
--What?

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,110
What's going on?!

98
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,680
What?! Who is it?!

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,810
What happened?!

100
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,090
You bastard!

101
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,810
Where did they come from?!

102
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,320
There are about thirty of them!
Watch out!

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,840
Thirty?! Really?!
I can't see - it's too dark!

104
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,870
They're quite strong!

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,140
Who are they?!

106
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,180
What? What did you just say?

107
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,920
Hey, you guys! Keep it down!

108
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,920
What?

109
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,580
Huh? What was that? What's going on?

110
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,880
Nice to meet you, ladies and gentlemen!

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,050
Who are you?!

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,320
My name is Breed.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm a Peto-Peto Fruit eater!

114
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,370
Peto-Peto (sticky)?!

115
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,420
What's that?! Are you
some kind of slimy man?

116
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,540
That's not Doflamingo?

117
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,660
I guess not.

118
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh no!

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,450
Caesar!

120
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,320
Fools! You can't keep me as a prisoner!

121
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,100
Don't underestimate Doflamingo!

122
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,740
So that guy's working
for Doflamingo, huh?

123
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,540
Wait!

124
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,740
Luffy?!

125
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,510
Ow, ow, ow...

126
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,860
Your body is rubber, it can't hurt!

127
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,280
Unless that thing can...

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,770
...use Haki!

129
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,420
You bastard!

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,330
I'll take Caesar! Goodbye!

131
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,950
Dammit!

132
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,230
What now?!

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,090
Giant waves!

134
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,120
Is that a Rabbit Wave?!

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,110
Oh no! The ship is bouncing up and down!
I can't control it!

136
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,280
What's that?!

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,830
Guys, look!

138
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,740
What the hell is that?!

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,900
An enormous island?

140
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,180
A Jolly Roger?!
That means it's a ship?!

141
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,270
That guy was a pirate?!

142
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,070
Let's chase him!
We can't let Caesar get away!

143
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,260
Luffy! Take the Shark Submerge!

144
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,940
It only can carry three people
but it can travel underwater!

145
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay!

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
Luffy, I'll come with you!

147
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,660
There's something that concerns me.

148
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,050
Alright!

149
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,020
Hey, Luffy! What about us?!

150
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,550
Look after the Sunny!

151
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,850
Gotcha! Don't worry about the Sunny!

152
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,320
Nose-ya, stay alert!

153
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,290
Doflamingo himself may come and attack!

154
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,790
Be careful!

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Attack?

156
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,500
Who did you call "Nose-ya"?!

157
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,220
Did they leave already?!

158
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,890
Are they gonna be okay?

159
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,940
What?

160
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,150
All three of them are Devil Fruit eaters
so if the unexpected happens...

161
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,590
Are they going to be alright?

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,330
There they are!

163
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,780
Alright, Chopper, go faster!

164
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,820
Luffy, don't they look like Lapins?

165
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,920
Lapins?!

166
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
The big rabbits you encountered
at the Drum Kingdom,

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,570
where I come from.

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,520
Oh, you mean those big
bear-like rabbits!

169
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,340
They look a little different
and Lapins can't swim but...

170
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,210
I think they are Sea Lapins.

171
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,920
What?

172
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,340
You know what they are?

173
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,420
I saw them once when I was
sailing across the North Blue.

174
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,360
They don't live in the
New World normally.

175
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,730
Was that why you came
with us, Raccoon-ya?

176
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,660
Uh-huh.

177
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,500
I mean, who are you
calling "Raccoon-ya"?!

178
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm not a raccoon, I'm a reindeer!

179
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,890
Keep it in mind, you fool!

180
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,280
Luffy, it's not funny!

181
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,380
I'm sorry!

182
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,780
That's not the only reason I
came with you. That animal...

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,550
He said "I don't actually
want to do this."

184
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,160
Raccoon-ya,
can you understand what the animals are saying?

185
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,250
Yeah, I can understand what they...

186
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,120
I said I'm not a raccoon!

187
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,960
That Breed guy who is
leading those sea monsters.

188
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,960
Hey Luffy, stop laughing!
Hey, are you listening?!

189
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,150
Hey, are you listening?!

190
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,150
Is he really working for Doflamingo?

191
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,890
I hope we're not getting
ourselves into a mess.

192
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,910
Oh, they're going in there.

193
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,830
We're in the enemy's territory.
Be really careful...

194
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,770
Hey, it's brighter over here!

195
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,670
Don't shout, you idiot! Listen to me!

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,640
He's right, Luffy! Listen to him!

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,980
Wow, how awesome!

198
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,950
It's a big fish tank!

199
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,480
Feels like we're in the sea.

200
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,790
Look, Chopper!

201
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,690
It's a fish tank all the way to the ceiling.

202
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,160
Hey, Straw Hat-ya!
We're not here for fun.

203
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,830
Look, Chopper! A sparkling shrimp!

204
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,370
Wow, cool!

205
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,730
That aside...

206
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,810
What?!

207
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,700
Okay, let's fight!

208
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,120
Room!

209
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,860
I can have more arms than you!

210
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,720
How did you like that?

211
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,940
It's almost morning. Let's move.

212
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,200
What?!

213
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,660
Like we thought, he uses Haki.

214
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,210
We have unfinished business.

215
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,680
If you can use Haki, I'll
fight with the gloves off!

216
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,210
Let's do this!

217
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,070
I win!

218
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,900
I win!

219
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,490
Wh-What? What?

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,090
What's going on?

221
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,550
He's saying "Master, long time no see."

222
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,900
Oh, don't tell me you're...

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,520
You became Luffy's disciple in Alabasta!

224
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,510
The Kung Fu Dugong!

225
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,330
Hey, what's going on?!

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,530
I'm the great scientist -
Master Caesar Clown-sama!

227
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,770
Hey, somebody, let me out!
Is anybody listening?!

228
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,420
Hey!

229
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,780
Hello.

230
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,580
How are you?

231
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,500
Oh, good. Thank you!

232
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,490
Now, let me out.
Where is Doflamingo?

233
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,820
Shut up, you worthless human!

234
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,510
Wh-What are you doing?!

235
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,620
Don't tell me you're not
working under Doflamingo!

236
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,150
Stop messing with me!

237
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,150
Who do you think I am?!

238
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,060
You're Caesar Clown - Joker's pet scientist.
Am I right?

239
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,410
Did you say Joker?

240
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,760
Are you connected to the
underground community?

241
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,250
Now, you better wag your
tail for me - Breed-sama!

242
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,290
Use your scientific mastery
to create my dream kingdom!

243
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,790
Huh? No way. I'm a great scientist.

244
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,900
Why should I follow orders from some guy
that I don't even know?

245
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,930
I wonder how much longer
you'll be able to say such a thing.

246
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,320
What are you gonna do to me?! No!
Hey! You bastard!

247
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,480
Oh, I remember you!

248
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,410
You're the Kung Fu Seal from Alabasta!

249
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,260
"It's been a while, Master!"

250
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,490
That's what he said.

251
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,080
It's nice to see you again!
How have you been?!

252
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,260
You two hit it off already?!

253
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,950
What is this all about?

254
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, he is a Kung Fu Dugong
who became friends

255
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,770
with Luffy in a kingdom called Alabasta.

256
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,640
Kung Fu Dugongs like to fight
and will challenge anyone to a duel.

257
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,440
You win.

258
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,340
But Luffy...

259
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,180
I win!

260
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,780
...Defeated him.

261
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,340
When they lose a fight, they have to

262
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,130
become a disciple to the one who beat them.

263
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,940
That's what this is all about.

264
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,630
I see. And what are they doing now?

265
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,330
Huh?

266
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,160
Like this, Seal!

267
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,560
One, two, one, two!

268
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,200
Pull your arm back all
the way - like this!

269
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,370
And use the lower half of your body!

270
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,790
Put more power to it!

271
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,730
One, two, one, two!

272
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,680
They're getting along so well...

273
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,890
You really are the seal!
You got much stronger, didn't you?

274
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,090
Oh, what's that?

275
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,460
"I saw the scar on your chest
in the newspaper and copied it."

276
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Did you hurt yourself?

277
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,320
"I painted it on!"

278
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,640
That's funny!

279
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,780
Now I know that you're
Straw Hat-ya's disciple

280
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,490
but why did you come to the New World

281
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,350
and kidnap our important hostage?

282
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,140
He said "I'm sorry for attacking the ship.
I didn't know it was your ship, Master."

283
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,120
"I have a good reason for that."

284
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,930
"When I met you in
Alabasta, you said..."

285
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,400
Pirates are free.

286
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,600
The sea is vast
and there is so much fun out there!

287
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,450
"Those words inspired me
so I sailed out to the sea all alone...

288
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,610
...dreaming of becoming
a free pirate like you!"

289
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,150
"I came across some very
formidable enemies!"

290
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,200
"I made a lot of friends!"

291
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,380
"We overcame so many difficulties

292
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,120
and formed a pirate
group of sea creatures."

293
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,730
"Then, we finally
entered the New World!"

294
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,430
"But that was when...

295
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,970
...we met that guy, Breed."

296
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,750
Hmmm. A pirate group of sea monsters?
How interesting!

297
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,980
All of you can join my crew!

298
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
"We're his slaves now."

299
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,350
"We kidnapped Caesar on his orders."

300
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,640
Breed. So He is the mastermind.

301
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,190
It seems like Doflamingo has
nothing to do with this.

302
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,080
I don't get it.

303
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,910
I know you're pretty strong.
Why do you have to listen to him?

304
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,570
"Because..."

305
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,540
Fall in, all of you!

306
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,440
--What was that?
--That was...

307
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,890
What's wrong?

308
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,110
What?

309
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,910
"Get out of here now"?

310
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,780
What?

311
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,300
How are you doing, pathetic humans?

312
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,770
Hey, you all are too slow.

313
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,800
Listen, here's how pets should be;
First, loyal. Second, loyal.

314
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,080
Third and fourth, loyal.
And lastly, loyal!

315
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,120
When I say "Fall in,"
you have three seconds!

316
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,020
Don't you get it?!

317
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Hey, Kung Fu Dugong.

318
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,030
You have to bring them together!
Why are you being so slow?!

319
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,900
If you let me down, you're
a failure as a pet!

320
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,330
You're no better than those shitty humans!

321
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,040
You're Breed, aren't you?
Give us back Caesar!

322
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,080
Huh?! Shut up, foul human!

323
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,630
Oh yeah, it's you guys.

324
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,750
Yes, I am Breed!

325
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm a pirate.

326
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,850
A pirate?

327
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,940
I can't believe a Warlord like
Trafalgar Law is here along

328
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,710
with Straw Hat Luffy, a pirate
with a 400 million bounty!

329
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,160
Thank you for chasing us all the way here,
you pain-in-the-ass, shitty humans!

330
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,010
You can't hit us with that.

331
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,180
I'm not so sure about that!

332
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,750
Pet-peto!

333
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,770
What?

334
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Ouch!

335
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,040
What's this?!

336
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,990
I can't take it off!
How does this work?!

337
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,090
You okay, Chopper?!

338
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,580
Trafalgar! Straw Hat!

339
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,840
You two are strong.
Stronger than me.

340
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,440
But is that enough to beat me?!

341
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,140
Now, you...

342
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,880
Wh-What do you want?

343
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,600
Tear Trafalgar and Straw Hat...

344
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,580
...limb to limb!

345
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,500
What? What's going on?

346
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,640
What's wrong, Chopper?

347
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,390
I can't control my body!

348
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,030
What's this? What's going on here?!

349
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,500
H-Hey...

350
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,980
That's amazing!

351
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,290
Chopper, what's happening to you?!

352
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,280
That was close!

353
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,890
Why are you attacking?!

354
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,890
That bastard!

355
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,330
Get away, you two!

356
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,400
What's going on?!

357
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,240
It seems as though he
hasn't lost his senses.

358
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,170
I can't control myself!

359
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,880
Please! Get away from me!

360
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,960
I have no choice. Room!

361
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,030
Don't do it! You can't hurt Chopper!

362
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,180
You fool! I'm not gonna kill him!

363
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,920
I just wanna control him!

364
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,340
Dammit!

365
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,200
I ate the Peto-Peto Fruit!

366
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,930
Peto-Peto? Don't tell me it's...

367
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,310
That's right!

368
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,930
I can manipulate all living things as I want
with my Peto-Peto power!

369
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,350
Which means I can make them my pet!

370
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,680
Pet? So "Peto-Peto" means "pet"?

371
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,390
I can control any living thing

372
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,050
and bring out all of its power!

373
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:05,260
You will see how deadly it is!
