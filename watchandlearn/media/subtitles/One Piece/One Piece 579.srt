00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

Since the day that the dream began

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,190
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,450
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,450
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,390
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,720
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,630
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,150
After surviving the fierce
battle at the Fish-Man Island,

78
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,670
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

79
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,190
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,570
Navigating the treacherous Maubeugemour Sea,

81
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,470
they met a Giant girl named Lily
who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,370
and got fired up to help
her save her father -

83
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,210
Panz Fry from the Navy's ship. However,

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,800
a mysterious group called the
Neo Navy was trying to kill him.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,590
Surface and finish them off at once!

86
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,550
Yes, sir!

87
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,140
You're responsible for all
the raids on pirates?!

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Yes, I am! I'm gonna cut
this guy's head off too!

89
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,530
And a three-way battle heated up between the

90
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,290
Straw Hats, the Navy and the Neo Navy.

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,620
You worthless pirates are no match for me!

92
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,290
Gum-Gum...

93
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,550
...Giant Jet...

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,510
Finger Pistol Ten!

95
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,180
...Spear!

96
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,900
And they were able to bring down
the menacing enemy - Shuzo!

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,850
But this was just the first foray into
the New World for the Straw Hats.

98
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,450
All right, let's go!

99
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,100
Yeah!

100
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:29,050
"Arriving! A Burning Island - Punk Hazard!"

101
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,390
Go!

102
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,810
Hey, hey, hey!

103
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,990
Whoa, whoa! Are we gonna be okay?

104
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,280
The Sunny will be fine!

105
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,360
What's that?

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,770
What?! That's impossible!

107
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,450
A red sea?!

108
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Look! The volcano's erupting!

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,380
Let's go to that island!

110
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,660
What?!

111
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,880
Wait a minute, Luffy!

112
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,340
Just as I thought.

113
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,850
None of the needles point to that island.

114
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,640
Let's go to that island!

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,560
I said "Wait"!

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,870
Why?! There is a volcano! It looks like fun!

117
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,860
Who could resist?

118
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,030
Listen to me, Luffy!

119
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,780
None of the 3 needles is
pointing at the island!

120
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,490
It's too peculiar even
in the strange New World!

121
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,870
It's erupting again!

122
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,620
It's right there! Who
cares about the needles?!

123
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,380
Let's just go there!

124
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,490
No way! We can't get any closer!

125
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,920
Because the sea is on fire!

126
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,180
I don't understand you!

127
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,890
It's perfect.

128
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,020
Hey, that's the Giant
Shellfish Panz Fry gave us.

129
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,440
I thought we could cook
this in that sea of fire.

130
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,470
Sanji! Now isn't the time for that!

131
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,780
--Sparks!
--The ship will catch fire too!

132
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
No!

133
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,530
The Sunny is super not gonna let us down!

134
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,660
That's not the point!

135
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,330
There's something wrong with this sea!

136
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,230
Look at those fish bones, bones, bones!

137
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,780
Huh? Did you just call me?

138
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,630
Wh-What's that?!

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,350
Hey, what's this? The
Transponder Snail is crying!

140
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,220
Hey, what's wrong?! You have a stomachache?

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,690
Fool! That's an emergency signal.

142
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,790
Somebody's calling for help.

143
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,690
If I pick it up, can we hear them?

144
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,290
Wait, Luffy!

145
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,490
More than 50 percent of
emergency signals are fake!

146
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,760
It could be a Navy trap - one they use often.

147
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,420
If the line is tapped, they
will find out where we are.

148
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,030
That's our Robin!

149
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,340
Hey, Luffy, you have to be careful...

150
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,050
Clank.

151
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,380
Hello? My name is Monkey D. Luffy!

152
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

153
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,390
You picked up too fast and said too much!

154
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,330
Help me!

155
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,180
What happened?

156
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,560
It's cold... Is this the Boss?!

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,650
No, I'm not the Boss. Is it cold there?

158
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,860
My colleagues are getting
cut one after another!

159
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,650
The samurai are gonna kill us!

160
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,320
Samurai?

161
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,410
Hey you, what's your name?! Where are you?!

162
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,830
Somebody please help me!

163
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,330
I'm on...

164
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,290
...Punk Hazard!

165
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,670
He got killed!

166
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,150
Th-That was...

167
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,100
I smell trouble...

168
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,020
He got killed - of course there is trouble!

169
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,530
Somebody just cut him!

170
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,990
The New World is scary!

171
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,170
Maybe he was acting and it's a trap.

172
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,020
How level-headed!

173
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,790
Come on, Robin-san!

174
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,620
Speaking of samurai, Brook...

175
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,500
Yes, what you think is right.

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,280
That's that name of the swordsmen
from the Wano Kingdom.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,770
The Wano Kingdom - closed
off to the outside world.

178
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,090
It's not even affiliated
with the World Government.

179
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,300
They say those swordsmen
called samurai are so strong

180
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,640
even the Navy can't approach.

181
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,690
This great sword - Shusui was once
carried by a legendary samurai.

182
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,030
If you become its owner,
the sword will be pleased.

183
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,930
I let this samurai's
body... take the beating.

184
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,380
I feel bad.

185
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,840
I've never heard of that country.

186
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,440
But he said Punk Hazard,
not the Wano Kingdom.

187
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,450
Did he mean the island of fire right there?

188
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,870
If he was using a Baby Transponder Snail,

189
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,190
that's about how far the signal can reach.

190
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,320
All right! Let's go help that guy!

191
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,760
No!

192
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,740
Luffy, think again! I think it's too late!

193
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,610
Samurai are scary!

194
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm scared too!

195
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,830
Hey you, what's your name?! Where are you?!

196
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,720
Somebody please help me! I'm on...

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,870
...Punk Hazard!

198
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,600
Smoker-san, that was...

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,510
Did he say Punk Hazard?

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,760
Damn!

201
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,350
How could they have gotten there?

202
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,920
The battle at the Fish-Man Island,
the incident after that...

203
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,810
If we plot the course they took from there...

204
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,620
Punk Hazard... It's possible they're there.

205
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,910
Don't do it! I'll do anything!

206
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,590
I'll do whatever you ask me to!

207
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,330
Then get charred!

208
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Stop it, you guys! Stop bullying pirates!

209
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,340
Tashigi! Let's head for Punk Hazard!

210
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,060
But Smoker-san,

211
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,890
Punk Hazard

212
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,280
has been deserted since they sealed it

213
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,180
off after what happened 4 years ago!

214
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,850
There shouldn't be anybody there!

215
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,170
You're right.

216
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,400
I don't think any living thing
can live there now but...

217
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,940
...it'd make sense to go check.

218
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,020
We are setting out for Punk Hazard, men!

219
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,320
Huh? Vice Admiral Smoker,
it's a restricted area.

220
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,540
Don't you know that?

221
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,330
Don't tell me about the law, you scum!

222
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay...

223
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,260
And who's going to the island?

224
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,410
Since there is uncertainty,
we shouldn't all go.

225
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,390
--Franky, I need the Mini-Merry!
--Okay!

226
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,020
Wait! Are you gonna go by yourself?

227
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,320
Do you have a problem with that?

228
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,700
Yes, I do!

229
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,380
If we let you go by yourself, you'll
disappear without telling us!

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,160
Huh?

231
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,720
Okay, he needs some company but
not the random belly-warmer guy.

232
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,000
What do you mean by that?!
I'll cut you, kinky cook!

233
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,230
Company? I'll go with him!

234
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,210
Yeah, sounds like fun.

235
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,920
Hey, maybe we'll pass
on this one. Is it okay?

236
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,470
I have no choice.

237
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,260
How about this?

238
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,300
We'll draw straws. No complaints, right?

239
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,100
What a pain! I'll go even if I lose.

240
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,640
Zoro! If I'm picked, go instead of me!

241
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,780
They say "Good luck lies in odd numbers"!

242
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,860
I'll stake all my life on this one!

243
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,210
#%=/+$!!!

244
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,510
All right, his companions are...

245
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,570
Us!

246
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,770
Can't wait!

247
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,470
Can't take it!

248
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,970
You won? How lucky!

249
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,970
I lost!

250
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,020
Please trade!

251
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,410
Here. I made a special
Giant Shellfish lunch box.

252
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,580
Can't wait!

253
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,580
Milky Road!

254
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,760
Cool! You created a path of clouds.

255
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
We saw the same thing at the Sky Island.

256
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
Now you can make it?

257
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Since it's made of clouds, you
have to take it while it's stable.

258
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,870
Okay!

259
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,150
All right!

260
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,400
Let's go, recon team! Here we go, Mini-Merry!

261
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,500
Good luck, guys!

262
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,780
You guys are so lucky!

263
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,890
I'm sure we'll have a chance to go later.

264
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,580
--Take care!
--Usopp, you can do it!

265
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,390
Please trade!

266
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,550
This Giant Shellfish is yummy!

267
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,800
Are you eating your lunch already?!

268
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,350
Oh, we're going over the flames!

269
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,810
This is fun!

270
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,890
We'll get across the sea of fire.

271
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,600
Are these clouds gonna be
here when we come back?

272
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,840
I'm glad that it stopped raining.

273
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,770
--It's a nice day to scout an island!
--But it's hot!

274
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,040
Nami-san, do those clouds reach the island?

275
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,400
I don't know.

276
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,850
But even if they don't,
Luffy will find a way.

277
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,080
Nami-san's so reckless!

278
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,710
I'm glad that I didn't get picked to go.

279
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,420
I can't stand the heat.

280
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,530
But letting him go by
himself wasn't an option.

281
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,510
They'll come back as soon as
they find out there's no one.

282
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,180
I didn't know you planned it out so well.

283
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,910
You're so kind, Nami-san!

284
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,190
I'll make you a cold dessert
with the Giant Shellfish!

285
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,870
Yeah!

286
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,470
You guys want it too?!

287
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,520
--Yeah!
--I want it!

288
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh, there is the erupting island!

289
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,200
See? I told you there should be an entrance.

290
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,130
Like I said, maybe somebody
was living here in the past

291
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,900
but no one can live here now!

292
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,120
The emergency signal earlier must
have come from somewhere far!

293
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,540
Right, Robin?!

294
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,870
It didn't look good but I like the taste.

295
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,290
You two are eating lunch too?

296
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,220
You're not gonna eat yours?

297
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,720
I don't feel like it now!

298
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,480
--Luffy, do you want this one?
--Yeah!

299
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,000
Here.

300
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,810
He's an excellent cook!

301
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,650
Sanji-kun outdid himself again!

302
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,360
I can't believe it!

303
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
The disorder I had 2 years ago is recurring!

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,870
Hey guys, the truth is, I have
a Fear-of-unknown-islands-osis.

305
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,110
I know.

306
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,990
I know.

307
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,790
I know.

308
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,900
Oh, I got a headache all of a sudden!

309
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,640
I feel a tightness in my chest too!

310
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,810
I have a stomachache!

311
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,840
It's hot!

312
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,380
This is the place.

313
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,560
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND ENTRANCE

314
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,890
The name matches.

315
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,560
So this is Punk Hazard...

316
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,260
Let's beach the Merry!

317
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,280
Do you think the emergency
signal came from inside?

318
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,270
Seems like no one's allowed
to enter this island.

319
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,840
Oh, Luffy, look at that!

320
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,060
"Danger" "Keep out"?

321
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,040
There are marks of the World
Government and the Navy!

322
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,330
That means even if somebody's here,
he belongs to the Government.

323
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,470
What a wasted trip! Let's go back!

324
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,150
H-Hey, Zoro, what are you doing?

325
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,060
Don't tell me...

326
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,500
Good, it's open.

327
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,530
Open...

328
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,240
Too hot!

329
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,880
You guys! Trespassing is a crime!

330
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,300
But we pirates are criminals anyway.

331
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,730
Keep me out of it!

332
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,190
Do you wanna challenge the Government?!

333
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,620
Oh, we already did!

334
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,390
Oh, hey, wait!

335
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,190
It's too hot, really.

336
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,860
Everything is on fire.

337
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,790
But it doesn't seem like the
island has been burning forever.

338
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,950
So was there a disaster? Or an accident?

339
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,950
Wait... Luffy!

340
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,090
That was close!

341
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,130
Hey, Luffy!

342
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,490
Those were probably not people's houses.

343
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,830
I think there were some kind
of Government facilities here.

344
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,970
They shut this island
down because it started

345
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,320
burning and became dangerous?

346
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,430
Or these facilities were
hazardous from the beginning?

347
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,830
The fact that the Log Pose didn't
point to this island troubles me.

348
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,580
Hey!

349
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,880
The guy from earlier - are you there?!

350
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,840
We're here to help you!

351
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,660
Hey! Come out!

352
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,750
Samurai!

353
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,860
Don't call them! They're murderers!

354
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,860
--Now you have an appetite?
--It's stress eating!

355
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,680
You know I've been thinking.

356
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,950
The man on the Snail said
"It's cold," didn't he?

357
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,620
It's cold... Is this the Boss?!

358
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,270
You're right.

359
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,700
It's really hot here but he said it was cold.

360
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,710
Maybe he's stupid.

361
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,050
No way, Sherlock!

362
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,100
Is there a cold place on this burning island?

363
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,890
Or that he had a chilling experience?

364
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,190
Robin, you're scaring me!

365
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,270
What is it? What is it?

366
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,310
What is that noise?!

367
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,070
Oh, that's...

368
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,610
It's yummy, Sanji!

369
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,070
I thought I was gonna melt in the heat.

370
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,000
It's cooling me down!

371
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,950
Ow, I feel a sharp pain!

372
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,210
Are my teeth sensitive?

373
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,860
You guys only get to eat it
because there are leftovers.

374
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,210
Thank Nami-san!

375
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,640
Oh, there are a lot for you, Nami-san!

376
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,180
Nami, what's the matter?

377
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,450
Yeah, the clouds...

378
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,070
I just noticed there's something strange
about the sky above the island.

379
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,400
The far side looks like the Arctic sky.

380
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,150
No way!

381
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,960
A Giant?!

382
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,850
No,

383
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,980
it's bigger than a Giant!

384
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,800
So it was the noise of the wind.

385
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,350
What's wrong, Luffy?

386
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,810
Is that...

387
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,660
What?!

388
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,240
Huh? Does it actually exist?!

389
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,270
No, it's a mythical creature!

390
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,250
There's no way that it's real!

391
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,660
But look at those features...

392
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,250
I don't think it could be anything else!

393
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,030
A dragon?!

394
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,460
A legendary creature has suddenly appeared. A dragon!

395
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,300
It breathes fire and has razor-sharp fangs.

396
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,470
It's amazing destructive power

397
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,540
proves difficul for even Luffy and Zoro to handle.

398
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,140
Then, the dragon says something

399
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,270
which is even more shocking!

400
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,790
On the next episode of One Piece!

401
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,670
"Arriving! A Burning Island - Punk Hazard!"

402
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,910
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
