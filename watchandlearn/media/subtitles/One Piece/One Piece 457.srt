2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,850
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,310
Luffy has broken out of the great prison Impel Down

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,320
and is headed to the Navy Headquarters in order to rescue his brother, Ace!

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,600
"A Special Retrospective Before Marineford! The Vow of the Brotherhood!"

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,300
That must be Ace-san's Vivre Card.

54
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,560
Yeah.

55
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,280
I heard a lot about you from Ace.

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,450
He told me that you two always used to run through the fields together.

57
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah! Ace and I were always together!

58
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,210
Wait! Ace!

59
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,950
I'm gonna beat you this time!

60
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,210
Eating together...

61
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,920
Sleeping together...

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,450
Spending all your spare time honing your skills...

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,620
You're still far from defeating me.

64
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,500
That's how it used to be -

65
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,750
Ace-san told me nostalgically.

66
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,130
Ace went out to sea 3 years before me.

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,510
He hadn't even eaten the devil fruit at that time but I couldn't beat him even once.

68
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,180
You hadn't seen him after he left?

69
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,700
No, I saw him in Alabasta once.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,990
Sheesh! I guess my letting you escape was pretty much pointless.

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,940
Yo!

72
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,440
Ace!

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,030
Haven't seen you in a while, Luffy!

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,530
This brings back memories!

75
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,170
I'm just in these waters on minor business,

76
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,880
so I thought I might look you up.

77
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,710
Minor business?

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,170
I'm a member of the Whitebeard Pirates now.

79
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,220
Whitebeard Pirates?

80
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,120
This is the mark of the Whitebeard Pirates. It's my pride.

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,890
Oh?

82
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,420
Luffy. Won't you join the Whitebeard Pirates?

83
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
Your friends can come too, of course.

84
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,060
No.

85
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,610
I figured not. Just thought I'd ask.

86
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,970
Whitebeard is the greatest pirate I know.

87
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,950
I wanna help him to be King of the Pirates...

88
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,920
...And not you, Luffy.

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,460
That's fine! Then we'll just have to fight!

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,720
Cheers!

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,010
Who said I was joining you?

92
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,780
Ace! Are you sure you won't join us?

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,210
I'm chasing a certain man.

94
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,390
His name's Blackbeard.

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,980
He used to be a member of the 2nd Division of the Whitebeard Pirates,

96
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,010
one of my men.

97
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,560
But he committed the worst possible sin on a pirate ship:

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,950
he killed a crewmember and jumped ship.

99
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,870
So, as the commander, I gotta find and get rid of him.

100
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,160
I wanted to give this to you. Here.

101
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,510
Hold onto it, always.

102
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,760
It's just a paper.

103
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,270
Yes, but that paper will lead us to one another.

104
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,380
You don't want it?

105
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
No, I want it!

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,200
Older brothers can't help worrying...

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,530
...if their younger brother is weak.

108
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,530
I know that he'll be a handful

109
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,780
but please look after him.

110
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,660
Huh? Are you leaving already?

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,630
Luffy! I'll see you at the top of the pirates' world!

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,050
Blackbeard...

113
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,510
I met him before in Mock Town.

114
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,680
--Hey, pops!
--Hey, buddy!

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,690
Hm? What's wrong?

116
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,550
--This cherry pie tastes extremely bad! Hm?
--This cherry pie tastes extremely good! Hm?

117
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,280
You bastard! Wanna fight?!

118
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,110
What the hell are you fighting about?!

119
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,320
Are you a pirate?

120
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200
Yeah, that's right.

121
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,380
What's the bounty for you?

122
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,110
30 million!

123
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,000
30 million? For you?

124
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,680
Can't be true! It's gotta be a lie!

125
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm not lying! That's the truth!

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,250
Stop it!

127
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,950
Whoa! They're gonna take Bellamy on!

128
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,820
Go for it!

129
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,760
Luffy, wait!

130
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,100
Hey, Mister! We want to go to the sky island!

131
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,720
Do you know anything about it?

132
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,860
She said "sky island!"

133
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,200
Give me a break!

134
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,920
Hey, you got me there.

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,210
You guys believe in such an ancient legend... that there's an island in the sky?

136
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,780
Just which era are you from?

137
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,550
Listen. The era where pirates dream about things is over

138
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,350
When I see idiots chasing after dreams like that, I get disgusted!

139
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,220
Luffy!

140
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,470
Zoro...

141
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't take them on, no matter what happens.

142
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,660
The sky island exists.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,300
You're that guy...

144
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,180
The new era they're talking about is crap!

145
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,790
The era where pirates have dreams will be over, they say?! Huh?!

146
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,280
People's dreams... have no end!!

147
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,370
Isn't that right?!

148
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,840
I still can't believe that somebody was able to beat Ace.

149
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,010
W-What?!

150
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,050
The Warlords and the Navy are gonna fight against the Whitebeards?!

151
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,510
What's that?! What's gonna happen?! W-W-W-W-Wait a minute!

152
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,070
T-This is too much to hear at once!

153
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,320
What a foolish man! You don't know anything.

154
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,490
I must say, that was just a prediction.

155
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,040
But the battle will probably happen.

156
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,960
The World Government has made a move.

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,110
Whitebeard is a man who would never allow his mates to be killed.

158
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,460
Even though they know this, they announced the public execution of...

159
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,880
...Portgaz D. Ace, a great commander of Whitebeard's.

160
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,930
What's wrong?

161
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,310
Ace... is gonna get executed?

162
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,970
I heard a pirate called Blackbeard...

163
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,910
...became a Warlord by defeating "Fire Fist" Ace.

164
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
That's my brother!

165
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,540
Ace is my older brother!

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,130
What?!

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,090
I wanna go and rescue Ace!

168
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,640
When I heard the news, I couldn't believe it either.

169
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,200
But... I didn't know that you already met Teech.

170
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,600
I remember that that's the way he talks.

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,150
Blackbeard!

172
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,180
So you're...

173
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
You're...

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
...Blackbeard?!

175
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,370
Huh? Oh yeah, I never gave you my name.

176
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,120
Long time no see, Straw Hat!

177
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,760
I was surprised, too, when I heard that you were the brother of my commander!

178
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,010
Are you sure you want to be here? You're gonna miss it!

179
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,300
Your brother's public execution!

180
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,560
I found out later that the former Warlord right there...

181
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,020
...Crocodile was defeated by you, Straw Hat Luffy!

182
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,420
At that time, I was trying to take his place as a Warlord so...

183
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,380
...killing you was the most effective way to show my ability to the Government!

184
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,050
But fate has saved you instead!

185
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,590
Pay your respects at his grave!

186
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,890
If it weren't for him, you'd be the one who...

187
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,510
...would've been killed, Straw Hat!

188
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,990
The guy that he killed was...

189
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,440
...called Thatch--the commander of the 4th Division of the Whitebeards.

190
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,410
He was a good-hearted man.

191
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,120
I wanted to help good old Whitebeard whom I owe so much

192
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,960
so I often visited the ship at that time,

193
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,540
but I didn't notice what Teech was up to!

194
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,130
And then,

195
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,800
Ace-san sailed out to sea alone.

196
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,540
As the commander of the 2nd Division of the Whitebeards,

197
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,860
he needed to get rid of Teech!

198
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,700
To all soldiers!

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,470
Report to the gulf!

200
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,560
Get ready for the public execution of Portgaz D. Ace!

201
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,270
I repeat!

202
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,050
All soldiers, report to the gulf!

203
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,830
Get ready to set sail! We've got a lot to do!

204
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,560
Hey! Wait, Teech!

205
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,930
I've been looking for you.

206
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,220
Ace! Commander!

207
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,200
Quit calling me "commander."

208
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,560
People who use that term usually respect others.

209
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,440
You can't fool me.

210
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,040
I got it. But let me say just one thing.

211
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,910
Ace! Why don't you join my crew?!

212
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's dominate the world together! The way is all planned out

213
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,970
Whitebeard's reign is over! I'll become the next Pirate King!

214
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,360
For starters, I'm gonna kill Straw Hat Luffy who is in the Water Seven...

215
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,810
...as a gift to the Government!

216
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,350
Luffy? What did you just say?

217
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,340
Oh! You know him?!

218
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,010
Another reason I can't let you go free!

219
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,320
He's my brother!

220
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,360
And of course...

221
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,660
...I'm not gonna become one of...

222
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,790
...your crew.

223
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,720
Fire Fist!

224
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,210
I know what you want, Ace. You want to kill me.

225
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,380
No wonder. Killing a crewmember is the worst crime.

226
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,010
Yes, I killed Thatch - the commander of the 4th Division!

227
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,510
According to the ship's rules, the one who finds it can eat it.

228
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,060
I remembered how they looked from seeing all the fruit in a book.

229
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,020
I noticed this was the one I'd been looking for.

230
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,980
That's why you killed Thatch? To steal it?

231
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,400
Well, it wasn't for no reason.

232
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,820
The power chose me, Ace!

233
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,150
With that fruit, I've become the world's strongest man, Ace.

234
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,260
Look! This one is different from all the other Logia type.

235
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,630
Ace, your body is made out of fire, right?

236
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,310
Mine's made out of darkness!

237
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,110
Firefly! Fiery Doll!

238
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,540
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow...

239
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,450
Ouch!

240
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,650
But it's odd.

241
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,620
If it was a Logia type fruit, you could fend off these attacks.

242
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,500
I told you. Darkness will drag in everything.

243
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,350
Bullets, blades, blows, fire, even thunder!

244
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,750
So I can't fend off attacks like you do.

245
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,200
My body will absorb even pain more than a normal person's.

246
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,100
But, in return for these risks, there's another thing that my darkness drags in!

247
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,730
Vortex!

248
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,290
The gravity of the darkness will pull in Devil Fruit eaters...

249
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,000
The gravity?!

250
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,550
...And my body will...

251
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,390
How's this? You get it already, don't you?

252
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,480
Ace!

253
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,980
No way!

254
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,750
You haven't been hit by somebody for long time, have you?

255
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,050
Ace.

256
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,200
I think that you got it when I grabbed you!

257
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,950
Another thing that my darkness drags in is...

258
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,010
...Devil Fruit powers!

259
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,100
That means as long as I touch them, Devil Fruit eaters can't use any of their powers!

260
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,140
Logia, Zoan, Paramecia...

261
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,710
All the Devil Fruit eaters in this world who put too much confidence in their powers...

262
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,710
...can't protect themselves from my striking power!

263
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,630
Then I won't let you touch me!

264
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,720
Vortex!

265
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,390
St. Elmo's Fire!

266
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,050
Ace!

267
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,530
Nothing can compete against darkness.

268
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,950
Even your strength.

269
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,160
But your power is such a valuable one.

270
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,290
Ace! You got to join my crew!

271
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,210
If I yield to power, there's no point in being born a man.

272
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,830
I'll never leave anything to be regretted later in my life!

273
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,060
Do you understand, stupid?

274
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,990
This world is worthless if you can't survive.

275
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,860
What a shame, Ace!

276
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,940
Die in the darkness!

277
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,070
Flame Commandment!

278
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,410
Flame Emperor!

279
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,360
The sun or the darkness - there'll be only one winner!

280
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm gonna make Whitebeard the king!

281
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,340
Three hours before Ace's exectution at the Navy HQ,

282
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,580
all seven Warlords assemble and await Whitebeard's arrival.

283
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,710
At the same time, the three Admirals gather...

284
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,230
Tension keeps rising before the inevitable battle!

285
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:44,940
"A Special Retrospective Before Marineford! The Three Navy Admirals Come Together!"

287
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
