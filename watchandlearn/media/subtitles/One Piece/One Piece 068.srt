Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,050
Oh!

22
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,500
The wind stopped again.

23
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,810
Just when we should be rushing
straight for Little Garden, too.

24
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,290
We're temporarily stopped again.

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,220
Time is running out as we speak, too...

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,260
Don't worry.

27
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,930
I know we need to get to Alabasta
as soon as possible, but...

28
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,240
Alright! Let's fish! Fish!

29
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,830
Hey, anyone seen the bait?

30
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,380
Bait? Oh, the stuff in there? I ate it.

31
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,360
You ate it?! Those were bugs, you know!

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,030
Yeah? They taste good!

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,910
Don't eat stuff like that!

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,260
Now what?! We can't fish now
that you've eaten our bait!

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,250
Use this, then!

36
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,080
We can't catch anything with that!

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,090
Really? We can't?

38
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,150
Then how about him?

39
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,550
Oh. That sounds okay.

40
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,470
Hey, you! Come here!

41
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,270
Get back here, bait!

42
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,890
Dammit, you guys! Knock it off!

43
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,400
But can't you guys be
a little worried, at least?!

44
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,000
Worried about what?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,870
Oh! Nami-san is lovely
when she's angry, too!

46
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,210
Honestly, now!

47
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,740
But it's strange.

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,280
For someone with a
30 million-Berry bounty,

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
he doesn't seem that
terrible of a person at all...

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,330
Yeah, it might be hard to imagine,
but he's beaten many big names.

51
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,810
Arlong, the fishman who was
bent on ruling the East Blue...

52
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,170
Pirate Fleet Commodore, Don Krieg...

53
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,130
Captain Kuro, an unknown pirate
notorious for his cunning methods.

54
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,860
You forgot one.

55
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,280
A navy freak who wields a huge axe-hand.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,680
Oh! Axe-Hand Morgan!

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,980
Axe-Hand Morgan?
I've heard of him before.

58
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,780
I heard he's a navy captain
who's feared in the East Blue

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,160
for his overwhelming domination.

60
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,520
You're saying he beat even him?!

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,220
Oh! The old axe-hand guy!

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,410
That reminds me, I wonder what
that guy with him is up to now...

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,110
I wonder if he's still
at that navy base...

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,100
Who's "he"?

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,420
Yeah! His name's Coby!

66
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,890
He's my friend!

67
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,780
"Try Hard, Coby!
Coby-Meppo's Struggles in the Navy"

68
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,370
Sub-Lieutenant!
Preparations for departure are complete!

69
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,220
"Justice"

70
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,230
I see.

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,810
All ships, move out!

72
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,990
Yes, sir!

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,770
Luffy-san! How are you?
It's me! Coby!

74
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,080
After we parted ways back then,
I've worked my hardest!

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,050
There were plenty of hardships,

76
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,850
but now I've achieved my
dream of being a navy officer!

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,620
C-Captain Morgan!

78
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,040
Coby...

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,010
Go to Hell, Coby!

80
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,480
Luffy-san!

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,700
Heya, Coby!

82
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,860
Gum-Gum...

83
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,310
...Tornado!

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,150
Wow! So pretty!

85
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,020
Oww!

86
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,650
I was dreaming!

87
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,880
What the hell?!
Quit screwing around, you!

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,940
Shut up!

89
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,750
Quiet!

90
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,590
Go to sleep, you idiot chore boys!

91
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,660
"Chore Boy"

92
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,650
At any rate, Luffy-san,
I'm now working at the navy base!

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,340
Captain Morgan's son Helmeppo-san
was given chore duty, too!

94
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,830
Hey! Quit slackin' off!

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,400
Oww...

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,110
Hey, chore boys! Wash the windows
when you're done cleaning!

97
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,070
Yes, sir!

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,140
And don't forget to
clean up in the mess hall!

99
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,980
Eh?! What about our meal?!

100
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,180
You're obviously not
gonna finish before lunch!

101
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,450
You can eat after
you've finished everything!

102
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,190
Eh?! But I'm starving to death here!

103
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,420
Helmeppo-san!

104
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,820
Helmeppo! Coby!

105
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,450
Yes, sir!

106
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,030
You're both aware neither of you
were qualified to join the navy...

107
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,210
...yet you were given special
permission to join as chore boys, right?

108
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,570
It's not like you let us join, though!

109
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,840
Yes, sir! Of course! If there's
anything I can do, I'll do it!

110
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,930
Just give the order!

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,010
No... just making sure you realize that.

112
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,380
Work hard, now!

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,110
Yes, sir! You can count on us!

114
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,100
We'll also be honored to do your laundry!

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,060
Are you an idiot?!

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,800
Eh?

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,790
You don't need to go out of
your way for even more work!

118
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,850
But we are chore boys,
after all! Okay! Work! Work!

119
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,050
"We"?

120
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,990
If you wanna work that badly,
you can do it yourself!

121
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,130
One! Two! Three! Four!
One! Two! Three! Four!

122
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,850
I can't stand this. Forget Coby--
why do I hafta be a chore boy?!

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,670
How I wish I could go back to then...

124
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,970
Helmeppo-sama. Your cocoa, sir.

125
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,650
Oww!

126
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,180
Dammit! Are you trying to scald me?!

127
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,180
No, sir! I-I'm very sorry, sir!

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,100
Who do you think I am?!

129
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:08,730
I'm Helmeppo-sama, only son of
the great Navy Captain Morgan!

130
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,280
Yes, sir! Helmeppo-sama!

131
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,660
Man, things were good back then!

132
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Dammit! This is all
that Straw Hat's fault!

133
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,470
He stripped Dad of his
position as a navy captain!

134
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,330
It's all his fault!

135
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,570
It's all because of Straw Hat that
I'm stuck doing this crap now!

136
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,730
Helmeppo-san.

137
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,640
What do you want?!
Don't touch me all friendly-like!

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,890
I'm sorry. But I wanted to tell
you something, as a friend...

139
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,220
Friend?! Why would
me and you be friends?!

140
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,790
Well, we are both chore boys...

141
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm not the kind of guy who
does chores in a place like this!

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,020
If it hadn't been for Straw Hat...

143
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,960
It's not good to blame Luffy-san
for everything like that.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,470
Blaming your fate on others
won't solve anything.

145
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,770
Wouldn't you agree that's
the sign of a weakling?

146
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,440
W-What?!

147
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,060
For a long time, you lived your
life using your father's power.

148
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,630
But from here on out,
we need to face forward

149
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,940
and search for our dreams on our own!

150
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,230
What are you...

151
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,130
I have a dream!

152
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,660
Someday, I will be a navy officer
who cracks down on bad guys!

153
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,740
How can you be like that?!

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,190
A wimp like you, being a navy
officer?! That'll never happen!

155
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,450
It will!

156
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,410
After seeing how Luffy-san lives
his life, I made up my mind!

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!

158
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,300
I've decided to be it, so if I die
fighting for that, that's fine with me!

159
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,420
So I decided to be like Luffy-san
and put my life on the line

160
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,680
to strive for my ambition!

161
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,340
You see? So let's both
work hard together!

162
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,690
Screw you!

163
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,150
You, lecturing me?! Since when
are you that high and mighty?!

164
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,810
What could you possibly learn
from that despicable Straw Hat?!

165
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,040
Don't talk bad about Luffy-san!

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,260
I haven't said anything that's wrong!

167
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,730
Even if that were true,
you still piss me off!

168
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,750
Helmeppo-san!
Please come to your senses!

169
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,480
Like you're anyone to talk!

170
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,420
Take this!

171
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,440
Wake up!

172
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,420
What is it?! What's going on?!

173
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,130
Sir! The chore boys
are fighting on the roof!

174
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,600
What are you gawking for?!
Stop them already!

175
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,400
You two!

176
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,130
W-We're sorry!

177
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,530
Eh? That explosion earlier
was you guys' doing?

178
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,450
Did they kick you out
of the navy after that?

179
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,510
Thank you for the food.

180
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,470
No, we managed to
avoid being kicked out.

181
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,610
We had to agree to work
for free for 50 years, though.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,420
Being kicked out
would've been much better.

183
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,990
Cheer up, you two!

184
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,390
Oh, yeah! Look at this!

185
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,360
"Straw Hat Luffy Wreaks
Havoc in Loguetown!

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,850
Manages a Baffling Escape
from Captain Smoker!"

187
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,200
Luffy-san!

188
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,430
This means Luffy-san
headed for the Grand Line!

189
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,480
At last, he's taken a big step
toward realizing his dream!

190
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,210
Attention!

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,020
I will now fill you in
on our current mission!

192
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,350
Hey!

193
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,470
Whadya want?!

194
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,070
D-Dad...

195
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,340
Former Navy Captain Morgan is
to be sent to Navy Headquarters

196
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,380
to face a court martial for the
crimes of military exploitation

197
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,930
and the tormenting of civilians!

198
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,130
His transfer and delivery to
Vice-Admiral Garp is today's mission!

199
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,820
I am Navy Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan!

200
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,460
You rankless, low-status scum
will kneel before me!

201
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,720
There's no getting around it, huh?

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,700
He should get court-martialed
or whatever else.

203
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,110
He does get what he deserves and all...

204
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,250
But to be honest,
I still respected him anyways.

205
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,890
My dad...

206
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,300
...was my idol.

207
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,080
But I guess he did take
things too far, huh?

208
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,750
Damn it!

209
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Why?!

210
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,420
Tell me, do you think
they'll execute him?

211
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,490
T-That's...

212
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,600
Maybe there's no getting
around that either, huh?

213
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,360
Given how my dad is...

214
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,570
Helmeppo-san...

215
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,050
All hands on deck!

216
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,810
Fall in!

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,260
It's Vice-Admiral Garp!

218
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,840
It's Garp the Fist!

219
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,760
So he's Navy Headquarters
Vice-Admiral Garp the Fist!

220
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,740
The hero of the seas who
travels all over the Grand Line!

221
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,810
Vice-Admiral Garp! Thank you
for coming all this way personally!

222
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,360
We hereby deliver Morgan to you!

223
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,910
Dad...

224
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,730
Stop, Helmeppo-san!

225
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,730
Umm... Vice-Admiral Garp?

226
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,850
Vice-Admiral Garp!

227
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,380
Quiet!

228
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,290
I hear you.

229
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,260
I've been up for five days now...

230
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,460
Thank you for your hard work, sir!

231
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,190
No, I've been going for a
new doughnut-eating record...

232
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,860
Sir?

233
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,330
But the lack of sleep and rest has
gotten me a bit drowsy at 842...

234
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,760
This geezer's a joke.

235
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,700
Morgan! Vice-Admiral Garp is a
leading figure at Navy Headquarters!

236
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,940
Old man. Cut the sleeping act.

237
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't move!

238
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,680
Move and I'll hack this chore boy
up and feed him to the sharks!

239
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,390
D-D-Dad!

240
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,060
Please stop this!
Helmeppo-san is your own son!

241
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,480
Son?! I don't need a son!

242
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,420
What I want is freedom!
His life means nothing to me!

243
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,750
I'll toss him into a pool
of blood if I have to!

244
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,890
D-Dad...

245
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,380
H-Help me!

246
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,160
So long, fools!

247
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,900
Helmeppo-san!

248
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,170
Ready the cannon!

249
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,940
Load! Aim!

250
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,020
Target-- 16 degrees starboard!
Distance-- 8,263! Ready!

251
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,080
P-Please wait!

252
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,190
That's dangerous!

253
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,720
What're you doing?!

254
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,150
P-Please don't shoot! My friend...

255
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,240
My friend's onboard!

256
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,140
Move.

257
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,180
No!

258
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,190
Then I'll cut you down!

259
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,150
--Stop, chore boy!
--Don't go against regulations!

260
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,110
No! Helmeppo-san is my...

261
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,370
...my...

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,840
...friend!

263
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,310
That fool. Stirring up trouble, huh?

264
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,520
You will pay for this.

265
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,730
That's much better than
just abandoning my friend!

266
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,230
Please! I'll go capture him myself!

267
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,020
You idiot! Come back!
There's no way you can catch him!

268
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,400
Let's let him go.

269
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,360
He's either quite the fool, or...

270
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,840
What do we do?!

271
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,580
What's with all the racket?
I'm finally awake...

272
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,810
Vice-Admiral Garp! I thought
for sure you'd been done in!

273
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,030
Huh?! Someone's been done in?!

274
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,250
I didn't see it because I was asleep!
Who was wounded?!

275
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,610
Me?

276
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,820
I'm free!

277
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,910
Just you watch! The world will
kneel down before me once again!

278
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,710
Today marks the new start of
the newly reborn Morgan Kingdom!

279
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,140
Now! Set our course to the west!

280
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,100
What're you doing?!
I said set our course to the west!

281
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,920
No!

282
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,670
I'll have no part in this!

283
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,310
He covered for me after this happened!

284
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,270
Even when getting kicked out of
the navy would destroy his dream!

285
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,740
He's protecting me, regardless of that!

286
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,720
I can do it, too!

287
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,130
Dad! I'm going to capture you!
Just give up--

288
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,890
Are you stupid?! Who do you
think you're talkin' to, huh?!

289
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,030
What can a piece of
useless scum do to me?!

290
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,490
Do as you're told, and I'll make
things nice for ya. So be quiet and--

291
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,420
Shut the hell up, Dad!

292
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,700
Dammit!

293
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,390
Know your place, you pathetic insect!

294
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,970
As if I'd ever listen to you!

295
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,090
I'm the one who decides how I live!

296
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,510
Quit getting the wrong idea!
What can scum like you possibly do?!

297
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,060
He isn't alone!

298
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,470
You!

299
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,550
M-M-Morgan!

300
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,890
Please give yourself up!

301
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,400
As a member of the navy forces,
I'm going to capture you!

302
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,940
Pathetic! Pathetic! Pathetic!

303
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,300
What can a couple of insects do?!

304
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,580
Get in my way and I'll
chop you both into pieces!

305
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm sorry it turned out this way
after you came to save me...

306
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,520
What are you talking about?

307
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,970
We're friends!

308
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,440
Coby...

309
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,560
Plus, I've made up my mind!
I've decided to live for my beliefs!

310
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,440
Damn it...

311
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,530
A-And if I die fighting...

312
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,150
...if I die fighting for that,
that's fine with me!

313
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,290
You wanna die that badly, huh?!

314
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,750
I'm not going to die!

315
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,830
Not until I've become a
navy officer! But, when...

316
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,130
When I do die...

317
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,590
...it'll be...

318
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,720
...while I'm fighting!

319
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,430
Playtime is over!

320
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,060
Coby!

321
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,560
You stupid idiot! Let Coby go! Coby!

322
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,530
You damn insects
aren't even worth killing.

323
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,020
Never show yourself to me again!

324
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,080
Morgan!

325
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,090
I'll let you go for today!

326
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,740
But someday I will surpass you!

327
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,060
Someday, I will catch you!

328
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,780
Just you wait!

329
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,160
Please forgive my poor supervision!

330
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,750
Allowing the prisoner to escape
is the biggest blunder of my life!

331
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,070
We're very sorry, sir!

332
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,030
After what's happened,
these two will be kicked out for life!

333
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,180
What truly lost causes you are.

334
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,950
I doubt anyone anywhere
would take you in now.

335
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,520
And you'd only burden everyone
if we turned you loose...

336
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,510
You leave me no choice.
Come with me to Navy Headquarters!

337
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,120
Vice-Admiral! You're going to
take them with you to Navy HQ?!

338
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,080
Is that bad?

339
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,550
N-No, not exactly...

340
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,840
Are you two against it?

341
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,290
If you want to run away,
now's your chance.

342
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,260
Though I have no intention
of letting you say no, anyway.

343
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,700
My, oh, my.
What an odd day this has been!

344
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,600
And that's how we wound up heading
for the Grand Line, Luffy-san.

345
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,690
I'm sure the day will come
when we meet again!

346
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

347
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

348
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

349
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

350
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

351
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

352
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

353
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

354
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

355
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

356
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

357
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

358
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,480
Oh! Here we go! Check it out!

359
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,820
What is it? Oh, this is a navy photo!

360
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,710
That's no ordinary guy in it!
Know who it is?!

361
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,720
--Whoa, it's Coby!
--Coby? Who's that?

362
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,730
My friend!

363
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,560
He's gonna be a navy softener!

364
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,500
You mean "officer"!

365
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,930
Man, talk about being careless...

366
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,260
On the next episode of One Piece!

367
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,530
"Coby-Meppo's Resolve!
Vice-Admiral Garp's Parental Affection"

368
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
