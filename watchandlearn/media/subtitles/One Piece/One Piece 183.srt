00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,930
God Eneru's plan is just about to start.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Try as hard as you like to run
and escape, people of the sky.

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,600
This is the end of Skypiea!

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,100
A party with angels dancing in the sky!

21
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,150
Hey you, have you ever seen
the look on people's faces

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,580
when they lose their foothold?

23
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,050
Everyone! Please go to the edge of
the clouds right away! To Cloud End!

24
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,340
Please escape to the Blue Sea!!

25
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,970
God Eneru intends to eliminate this nation!

26
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,820
If you stay here, you'll all die!!

27
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,610
Make the decision to leave this land!

28
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,900
While people began their escape,

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,330
the time for the showdown between
Luffy and Eneru finally arrived!

30
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,500
Are you that Eneru Guy?!

31
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,300
What makes you God?!

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
You'll know soon enough.

33
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,370
El... Thor!!

34
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,190
100 Million Volt... Vaari!

35
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,060
Is it possible that lightning doesn't
work on him because he's rubber?!

36
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,970
It could be... that Luffy is Eneru's one
and only natural enemy in the world!

37
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,340
"Maxim Surfaces! Deathpiea Is Activated!!"

38
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,300
Rubber doesn't conduct lightning!

39
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,620
Eneru's attacks don't
work on a rubber person!

40
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,670
He can defeat... Eneru!

41
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,630
What the hell... are you?!

42
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm Luffy.

43
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,860
I'm a pirate and a rubber person.

44
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,150
Rubber?

45
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,540
I get it... Rubber doesn't
exist in the White-White Sea.

46
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,080
Lightning doesn't work on me!

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,100
Mantra...

48
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,130
Gum-Gum... Whip!!

49
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,930
Spear!!

50
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,730
He's predicting Luffy's moves perfectly!

51
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,900
Luffy!!

52
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Don't push your luck.

53
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,600
Lighting can do more than
just cause electric shock.

54
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,580
Once I know it won't work,
I'll fight accordingly.

55
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,010
Physical attacks won't work on me, either!

56
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,750
Dammit!

57
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,780
So this guy has that ability that
allows him to read my moves, too!

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,050
Lightning doesn't work.
Physical attacks won't work, either.

59
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,770
Just what is this "rubber"?

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,250
No, hold on a second.
He's a Paramythia, after all.

61
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,070
Most of them should keep their original form.

62
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,020
Grom... Puddling!

63
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,400
I don't have time to play
with the likes of you.

64
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,970
The stick is... being refined into a blade!

65
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,560
Consider it lightning that has taken shape!

66
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,040
As I thought, slashing attacks
are your Achilles heel.

67
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,940
Yeah.

68
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,320
Don't tell him that!

69
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,160
Gum-Gum... Gatlin--

70
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,880
He disappeared!

71
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,660
Luffy! Behind you!!

72
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,750
He's moving through the gold!

73
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,620
Ow, it's hot!!

74
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,380
So even if electricity doesn't work,

75
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,490
the electric heat that builds up
on the trident is different, huh?!

76
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,290
Gum-Gum...

77
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,680
...Battle-Axe!!

78
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,590
How dare you, you brat?!

79
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,980
Gum-Gum... Gatling!!

80
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,340
It's not as if your arms multiplied!

81
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,540
Luffy!

82
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,120
Sight-seeing on a sky island...
What a bad time to come, Blue Sea people.

83
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm God, so I'll do everything as I please.

84
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,430
I will create a world
according to my desires.

85
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:13,010
I won't let some clueless Blue Sea brat
that suddenly showed up get in my way!

86
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,280
Now, how about we watch
the fall of this nation together?

87
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,950
Don't tell me...

88
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,050
Max 200 Million Volt Vaari!

89
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,480
Horsey-Bird! The ship is moving!
What're we gonna do?!

90
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,710
Luffy!! Nami!!

91
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,230
Behold! It's rising!

92
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,860
The ark that will take me to the land
without end, the Endless Vearth...

93
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,110
Maxim!!

94
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,780
I-It's rising!

95
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,070
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no...

96
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,280
We have to escape!

97
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,620
Luffy! Hurry up and beat Eneru!

98
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,700
Ahhh! W-W-Wait a second!

99
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,470
If Eneru is defeated,
isn't this ark going to fall?

100
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,880
Ahhh, but unless he's defeated,
the sky island will be gone.

101
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,660
And if we stay here...
we'll be taken somewhere.

102
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,440
What're we gonna do, Luffy?!

103
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,940
Don't get so rattled.

104
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,010
How can I not...?! But...!

105
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,530
You're a friend of the
future King of the Pirates.

106
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,030
Don't show such a pitiful face.

107
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,720
King of the Pirates?
Which area does this king govern?

108
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,380
He's the great king of the seas!

109
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,050
Oh, how impressive. Why don't
we settle things... in this sky?

110
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,110
Look, Horsey-Bird! The ship isn't moving!

111
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,580
It's stuck in the Vearth
and can't go up anymore!

112
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,780
But it's just a matter of time!
It's scraping away at the Vearth!

113
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,500
No, we can't do that!
If we go, we'll be in his way.

114
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Luffy is a warrior from the Blue Sea!

115
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,660
We shouldn't interfere in a warriors' duel!

116
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,580
The sky island will fall from the sky!

117
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,700
This is the end!

118
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,460
Get out of here!

119
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,040
Quickly! Please hurry up!

120
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,810
All the way to Cloud End, we,
the White Berets, will ensure your esca--

121
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,020
P-Please hurry up! Hurry!
We don't have much time left!

122
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,900
As many people... We have to
save as many people as possible.

123
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
Sir!

124
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,090
What're you doing?! Please hurry and escape!

125
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,070
I've always believed in God.

126
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,910
If God is giving us death,
I should accept it.

127
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,180
Eneru... That man doesn't have
the right to take people's lives!

128
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,400
We all have to continue to live!!

129
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,200
Now, please escape! And please live!

130
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,400
Grandpa... Grandpa! Hurry!!

131
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,270
Heso!

132
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,780
Captain!

133
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,960
We're heading to the Shandians' village.

134
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,750
The Shandians' village?

135
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,790
Someone needs to let
them know, or they'll perish!

136
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,350
We'll escape together!

137
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,970
The Shandians are people, just like us!

138
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,550
I thank you for your assistance!

139
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,850
The circuit to this ark's ultimate feature
is already open and functioning.

140
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,560
Ultimate feature?

141
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,440
Its name is Deathpiea.
It's despair, the savior of this world.

142
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,860
What's he going to do?!

143
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,150
Now Deathpiea... activate!

144
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,040
What is that?!

145
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,350
Clouds?!

146
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,250
Clouds...

147
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,680
Chief!

148
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,610
Something's wrong with
the sky above Upper Yard!

149
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,960
The sky?

150
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,040
Yeah, it has suddenly gotten dark.

151
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,910
This is the first time I've
seen Skypiea's sky like that!

152
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,270
This is creepy.

153
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,160
Could something have
happened to our warriors?

154
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,300
To see such thick clouds in
the sky of the White-White Sea...

155
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,340
What on earth...?!

156
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,640
The sky... The sky is becoming dark!

157
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,670
It's finally come! The end of the world!

158
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,450
Could it be...?

159
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,300
That's right! It's a thundercloud.

160
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,860
With my energy, Deathpiea
discharges thunderclouds

161
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,380
that have extremely turbulent currents.

162
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,350
Thunderclouds?!

163
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,340
Soon, the clouds will cover
all of Skypiea in darkness

164
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,490
while their energy increases.

165
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,610
On my signal, they'll produce
dozens of thunderbolts

166
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,240
and destroy everything in this nation.

167
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,340
For example...

168
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,100
It's coming from Upper Yard!

169
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,270
Hurry to the ships!

170
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,150
Everyone, keep calm, don't panic!
Head to Cloud End!

171
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,780
How dare you, Eneru?!

172
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,850
Eneru...!

173
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,490
What did you just...?

174
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,150
I teased the angels a little.

175
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,480
You think it's okay for a
god to destroy everything?!

176
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,930
That's right. Lives, and land as well.

177
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,850
Now, I'll eliminate you! The preparations
for the party have already begun!

178
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,920
O-Ouch!! Ow, ow, ow, ow...

179
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,770
This is a highly charged spear!

180
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,050
Ouch!!

181
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,750
Dammit!

182
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,320
Isn't there some way I can counter
that "predicting movements" thing?!

183
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,700
Oh, yeah!

184
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,140
Gum-Gum...

185
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,660
...Airhead.

186
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,770
What the heck are you doing, Luffy?!

187
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,760
He's unconsciously dodging the
attacks using just his reflexes!

188
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,100
No, it's like he's grass, for example,
which just sways with the wind.

189
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,570
He isn't thinking anything,
so even Eneru can't predict him!

190
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,760
Since I'm just being an airhead...

191
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,910
...I can't attack him!

192
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,690
What are you, stupid?!

193
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,330
If I could somehow grab hold of him,
I wouldn't be at a disadvantage.

194
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,920
Oh, yeah!

195
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,830
Gum-Gum Octopus!

196
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,050
No!!

197
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,520
Enough with the weird ideas!!

198
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,550
It seems you don't like Mantra.
That's to be expected!

199
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,100
It's another reason for
my overwhelming power!

200
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
That place should work!

201
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,280
Gum-Gum...

202
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
No matter what you do,

203
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,670
you're just an idiot whose body
happens not to be affected by lightning!

204
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,100
...Octopus...

205
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,870
What?! Why the ship?!

206
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,830
...Fireworks!!

207
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,410
Fool! You can't hit me!

208
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,460
Are you trying to destroy
the ship?! It's no use!

209
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,030
I get it! Ricochet!

210
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,620
Luffy isn't controlling those
punches that rebound from the wall!

211
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,260
I won't let you get away anymore!!

212
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,880
Gum-Gum...

213
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,010
W-Wait!

214
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,130
...Bazooka!!

215
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,860
No...! It's coming!

216
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,270
I... I have to escape!

217
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,830
Gum-Gum...

218
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,660
Here it comes!

219
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,040
I... I have to evade it!

220
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,030
...Rifle!!

221
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

222
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

223
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

224
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

225
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

226
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

227
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

228
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

229
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,700
Once you're gone, the world will be mine!

230
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,490
Fight me, Eneru!

231
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,810
Feast your eyes, rubber person,
on the falling island's despair!

232
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,180
This will be the end of the sky island!

233
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,690
What should we do?! The
ship's gonna fly away!

234
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,240
Where's the fun in gaining
what you want all by yourself?!

235
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,610
On the next episode of One Piece!

236
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,920
"Luffy Falls!
God's Judgment and Nami's Wish!!"

237
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
