2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,730
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,990
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,950
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,500
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,090
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,640
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,770
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,570
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,030
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,320
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,290
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,840
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,390
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,980
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,110
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,860
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,410
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,660
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,000
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,050
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,670
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,380
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,090
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,720
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,390
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,060
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,430
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,520
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,900
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,190
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,530
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,700
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,080
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,410
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,750
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,710
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,170
Okay! The Great Usopp
will be the first to jump off!

48
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,510
--Yay!
--Lookie!

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,260
Wow! That was awesome!

50
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,930
Hey, me next!

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,960
All right, go for it!

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Almost there!

53
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,980
And here... I go!

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,030
You did it!

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,370
Ow!

56
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,710
"Absolutely No Entry"

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,880
Damn it! I thought I was doing her a favor!

58
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,100
Wh-What in the...? You didn't!

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,220
What're you doing in here?

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,680
Didn't see the writing that said to keep out?

61
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,800
I guess you can take a peek,

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,790
but I had planned on surprising
everyone all at once.

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,510
Don't tell the others about it yet.

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,230
Whatcha think? Feeling especially surprised?

65
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,900
It had a lackluster design,
not to mention boring features.

66
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,730
So I spruced it up a bit!

67
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,900
But I've never seen its power source before.

68
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,690
Where'd you get it?

69
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,580
Don't remodel stuff without permission!

70
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,880
What did you use as the motif?!

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,300
C-Can't you tell? It's a white hobby horse...

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,640
This is a hardcore waver
equipped with a Jet Dial!

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,170
And you had the nerve to
turn it into a hobby horse?!

74
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,470
Do you think I'm a kid?!

75
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,960
Uh, no...

76
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,190
It's done!

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,520
I know they won't complain
about the design now!

78
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,980
This is my trump card.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,310
"Plunging into the Devil's Sea!
The Mysterious Skeleton Floating in the Fog!"

80
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,600
Yay! Luffy's next!

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,250
Go!

82
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,880
Wow! That's a new record!

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Nami-san! Robin-chan! Sorry for the wait.

84
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,330
I know! This time let's jump off together!

85
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,470
--Okay!
--Hey, guys!

86
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,970
--Almost ready...!
--If you're goofing off,

87
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,800
could you grab those octopi you
threw in the aquarium yesterday?

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,890
Octopi?

89
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah.

90
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,070
We're having octopus rice
and octopus shabu.

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,560
I'll boil tomatoes to soft
perfection for a sauce

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,070
and make some colorful salpicon!

93
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,450
I figured I'd use all the
octopi in tonight's dinner.

94
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,120
Sounds good! Sanji, add fried
octopus to the menu!

95
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,750
Make a hundred!

96
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,950
Fine, you got it.

97
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,410
So go get 'em!

98
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,090
All right!

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,950
They're certainly lively.

100
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,100
Oh, perfect timing! I
have one for you, Robin.

101
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,560
--Thank you.
--Hurry! --Octopus!

102
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,390
Octopus! Octopus! Octopus!

103
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,980
Heave-ho!

104
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,860
I'll get them!

105
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,060
Darn it! They keep getting away!
I can't catch any.

106
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,000
All righty! Now it's my turn.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,570
No, wait! If they pull you into the water,

108
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,450
you Devil Fruit power holders will drown!

109
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,240
Leave this to me.

110
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,630
Usopp?!

111
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,170
Damn! Where'd they wander off to?!

112
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,130
Found them!

113
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,760
The darn things are clinging onto each other!

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,820
But...

115
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,230
Prepare to meet your maker, octies!

116
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,980
In the end, you're no match
for the Great Usopp!

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,150
There's one!

118
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,030
Two and three!

119
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,360
Four, five, six...

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,760
Darn octopi don't know when to give up!

121
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,090
Usopp!

122
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,060
Well, that's no good!

123
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,810
Curse you!

124
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,180
Get off me!

125
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,110
What's going on? The
water turned pitch black!

126
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,400
Hey! Are you okay down there?

127
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,530
Usopp's in trouble!
The octopi latched onto him!

128
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,670
What?!

129
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,140
Usopp, grab on!

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Usopp!

131
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,890
Are you okay?!

132
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,670
Usopp!

133
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,510
Let go, you little--

134
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,600
You little twerp!

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,310
It's no good! The water's so
dark I can't see where he is!

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,320
If I know where they are, I can...

137
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,780
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

138
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,870
He's alive!

139
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,670
What a relief.

140
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,630
Your punches nearly killed me!

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,220
All this over some measly octopi.

142
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,220
You're the one who said to go get them!

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,160
What were they doing?

144
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,100
Hey, something's floating on the water.

145
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,640
What? What?

146
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,720
Huh? Where is it?

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Is that it?

148
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,940
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"

149
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,940
A barrel?

150
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,350
Doesn't it say "treasure" on it?

151
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,190
"Treasure"

152
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,640
You're right! Maybe a treasure
ship accidentally dropped it!

153
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,240
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,780
Treasure?!

155
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,940
Hey, Luffy! Let's pull the thing up already!

156
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,920
Okay!

157
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,410
Treasure! Treasure!
A treasure of silver and gold!

158
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,790
Pieces nice and big! Nice and--

159
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,170
Nope!

160
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,720
That contains booze and rations.

161
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,260
How would you know if
you haven't looked inside?

162
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,720
Doesn't the banner say,
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"?

163
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,610
"Offering of Treasure to the Sea God"

164
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,340
It's called a "drifting barrel."

165
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,550
It means someone made an
offering to the god of the sea

166
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,610
in hopes of a safe voyage.

167
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,310
"Offering of Treasure"
means it's a gift to the god.

168
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,890
That bites! So we can't do anything with it?

169
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,370
Hey! Since we picked it up,
let's drink the booze!

170
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,620
Stupid! The god'll get angry at you!

171
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,080
You can drink it as long as you pray first.

172
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,330
I don't pray to any gods.

173
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,420
I've heard that booze is extra good
after it's been floating on the waves.

174
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,010
Then we've gotta try it out!

175
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,720
Sweet! Let's have a toast!

176
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,180
It's custom to refill the barrel with
fresh offerings after you've emptied it.

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,310
--Yeah?
--Let's open it! Hurry up and open it!

178
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,810
Hey, God! I'm taking your snacks. Heh, heh!

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,510
What's so great about "God"?

180
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,070
Didn't a certain someone beat the
crap out of that God on Sky Island?

181
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,470
Okay, I'm done praying.

182
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,370
Cool, it opened!

183
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,280
Something flew out!

184
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,340
What's that?

185
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,260
Red light...?

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,880
What was that? What does it mean?

187
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,420
The booze flew out, flashed, and vanished.

188
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,050
It was a flare.

189
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,890
A flare?

190
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,770
Don't you mean the Sea God's curse?

191
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,570
I hope someone did that as a
simple prank, but just maybe...

192
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,360
Just maybe?

193
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,080
Someone may come after our ship.

194
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,360
S-So that was a trap?!

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,860
"By opening the barrel, we just informed
someone of our location!" Like that?

196
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,670
Chopper, check the perimeter!

197
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,170
--I'm on it!
--More bounty hunters might come down on us!

198
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,050
I don't see anyone anywhere!

199
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,970
Same here!

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,580
Yeah, I don't see anyone...

201
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,920
But this air pressure...
And the clouds are moving quickly.

202
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,230
Everyone, take your stations!
We're escaping to the south-southeast!

203
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,320
A huge storm will be here in five minutes!

204
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,600
I don't see a storm, but if that's
what she says, I bet it'll suddenly hit!

205
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,950
Nami, where should I take us?

206
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,700
Head straight for 2 o'clock!

207
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,250
Th-There...

208
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,550
Damn! It started to rain
right after her warning!

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,350
Now we've got lightning!

210
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,270
Crap! We're getting hit by head winds!

211
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,320
They're going to push us back!

212
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,540
Hey! Is this ship really
that big of a pushover?

213
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, yeah!

214
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,530
Guys, take in the sails!

215
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,920
We're bringing out the paddle!

216
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh, that?

217
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,640
I love how cool it is! Do it!

218
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,100
Are you all set?

219
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,350
The main sail is set, Nami-san!

220
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,310
I took in the foremast!

221
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,650
Franky, we're ready!

222
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,060
Great!

223
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,530
Soldier Dock System, Channel 0!

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,740
With its cola-powered engine,
it's the Paddle Ship Sunny!

225
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,910
Go!

226
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,460
Plow forward!

227
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,390
We survived!

228
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,490
Yeah. It's nice that we pulled through,
but what's with this sea?

229
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,900
It isn't night yet, but with this thick fog,

230
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,700
it's creepy how dark it is.

231
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,570
Do you think we stumbled into that one sea?

232
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,410
I'm not ready for this!

233
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,510
What? We're drawing up on Fishman Island?

234
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,760
Nope! First we have to cross haunted waters.

235
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,590
Yep! Don't let your guard down.

236
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,180
From the looks of it, we're already
caught in the infamous...

237
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,760
...Florian Triangle!

238
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,440
These are mysterious waters where
everything disappears without explanation.

239
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,320
I-It's h-ha-haunted...

240
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,450
These seas are haunted!

241
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,280
What the hell?! And you all knew about this?!

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,910
You never bothered to fill me in!

243
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,630
Zoro...

244
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,120
Granny Kokoro gave us the heads up.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,100
There's a living skeleton!

246
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,140
A-A l-living skeleton?

247
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
Only in your imagination.

248
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,640
Don't scare him more than he already is.

249
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,520
Listen, Usopp.

250
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,190
In this sea, over 100 ships
mysteriously vanish every year.

251
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,020
And to top it off, I've heard ghost ships
carrying the dead wander these waters.

252
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,540
No! You shoulda warned me about this sooner!

253
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,150
What good would it have done?

254
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,430
I-I coulda prepared! I've gotta
cover myself in anti-evil stuff!

255
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,660
Usopp, please let me borrow some!

256
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,040
♪ Yo ho ho ho ♪

257
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,900

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,810

259

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,450

What's with that song?!

267
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,060
It's an evil spirit's sailor song!

268
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,890
Don't listen! Plug your ears!

269
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,120
It'll curse you!

270
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,580
Pretend you can't hear it if
a ghost tries to talk to you!

271
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,790
It'll drag you into the sea if you respond!

272
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,630
Evil spirits wanna drag you down with them!

273
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,100
No!

274
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,510
♪ Yo ho ho ho ♪

275
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,260

276
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,560
If he's our foe, we'll take him out.

277
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,480

Did you see that just now?
A skeleton was singing!

282
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,100
S-Stupid! Skeletons don't sing.

283
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,150
You're just hearing things!

284
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,730
Yep, yep!

285
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,650
But didn't you hear him?

286
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,200
C'mon! Let's go! Like right now!

287
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,370
There really is a living skeleton! Sweet!

288
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,450
Hold your horses!

289
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,950
Not so fast, Luffy.

290
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,280
Go on. We're going to draw to see
who goes aboard that ship with Luffy.

291
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,420
What?!

292
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,330
Why?! Send whoever actually wants to go!

293
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,130
Right! That's what we should do!

294
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,920
Do that!

295
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,430
Are you sure you're okay with that?

296
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,730
Okay, let's go!

297
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,520
Yay!

298
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,190
I hate this...

299
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,180
Please let me draw!

300
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,390
Whoa, Zoro-kun! Wait, wait!

301
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,760
Does everyone except the
three of us plan on going?

302
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,200
I'll draw! I'll draw! I'll take my chances!

303
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,190
I can go by myself, you know!

304
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,150
If we don't hurry, the ship's going to leave.

305
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,990
That isn't an option.

306
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,330
Just draw your sticks already.

307
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,880
Two people will go with him.

308
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,970
It'll be their job to make sure
he doesn't do anything stupid.

309
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,950
Why'd it have to be me?

310
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,110
I wanna go back...

311
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,810
Nami, you ready yet? Hurry on up!

312
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,230
No, no, no, no!

313
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,850
I said I was cool with going by myself...

314
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,410
Forget it! What if you did something
stupid that got our whole ship cursed?

315
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,030
My luck bites!

316
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,670
Nami-san, never fear!
I'll protect you, Nami-san!

317
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,840
How are you supposed to protect me...?

318
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,790
Nami, weren't you eager
to find a treasure ship?

319
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,960
There's no way this is a treasure ship!

320
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,430
Didn't you see that skeleton move around?!

321
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,440
I bet he's the treasure's guardian!
Let's go look for him.

322
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,780
H-Huh?

323
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,130
No!

324
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,190
Evil be gone! Evil be gone!

325
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,010
Luffy, rest in peace!

326
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,130
Huh?

327
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,190
Good day to you!

328
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,630
Sorry for earlier! Our eyes locked, but I
wasn't able to give a proper greeting.

329
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,920
You gave me quite a start!

330
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,350
How many decades have passed
since I saw people in the flesh?

331
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,180
Every ship I run across seems
to be a ghost ship! It's dreadful!

332
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,740
Come along! Feel free to come right inside.

333
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,050
Why don't we enjoy a nice,
leisurely conversation?

334
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Look! He's talking!

335
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,790
The skeleton has an afro and he's talking!

336
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,010
I can't believe it...

337
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,890
My, my!

338
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,350
What a truly elegant lady! You're beautiful!

339
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,110
N-No, hardly!

340
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,390
My eyes follow the beautiful ladies.

341
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,520
But I'm a skeleton, so I don't have eyes!

342
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,120
May I see your panties?

343
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,210
No way!

344
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,260
My, my! You're harsh!

345
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,710
That made my bones rattle,
especially since I'm a skeleton!

346
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,870
Shut up!

347
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,220
How did a skeleton get a bump on his head?

348
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,700
Say, do you poop?

349
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,070
There are a boatload of questions
that should come before that!

350
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes, I poop.

351
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,040
Don't take so long to answer
his question! And who cares?!

352
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,580
For starters, why are you alive and
talking when you're nothing but bones?

353
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,950
What the heck are you?

354
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,660
What are you doing here?

355
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,790
What happened on this ship?

356
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,590
What's the story behind this sea?!

357
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,760
Answer all of my questions!

358
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,780
Wait.

359
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,310
Putting that aside...

360
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,190
...join my crew!

361
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,070
Yeah, okay.

362
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,690
Hey!

363
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,450
Hello, everyone! Good day to you.

364
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,050
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.

365
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,920
Who the heck is this, Luffy?

366
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,160
Isn't he funny? I added him to our crew.

367
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
No, you did not!

368
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,730
Really, don't get so worked up.
Let's have dinner.

369
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,270
That's not for you to decide!

370
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

371
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,650
"The Joy of Seeing People!
The Gentleman Skeleton's True Identity!"

372
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
