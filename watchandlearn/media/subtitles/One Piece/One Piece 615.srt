00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,670
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,250
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,130
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,650
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,600
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,520
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,980
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,110
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,260
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen

17
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,580
and learned about the ruler of the
island - Caesar Clown's motive.

18
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,910
All while trying to escape Shinokuni,

19
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,670
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

20
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,880
Luffy and the others are on
the move to kidnap Caesar,

21
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,210
-- save the children, and
escape from the island.

22
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,050
Give us the candy!

23
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,130
--No!
--Give it to us!

24
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,400
No, you can't have it!

25
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,930
Shut up!

26
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,180
Just give us the candy already!

27
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,390
What is she thinking?!

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,850
No, spit them all out!
Mocha, can you hear me?!

29
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,770
Mocha!!

30
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,890
I told you what kind of drug they are!

31
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,160
What?!

32
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,620
Straw Hat Luffy! Why are you here?!

33
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,460
Shoot! Shoot!

34
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,970
Where's Caesar?

35
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,430
I don't know! I-I don't know anything...

36
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,470
Where's Caesar?!

37
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,830
"Brownbeard in Grief! Luffy
Lands a Furious Blow!"

38
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,740
Shinokuni, the deadly gas, is
flowing into the Third Laboratory

39
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,450
and starting to fill up B
Building where the Straw Hats,

40
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,090
the Navy G-5, and the children are.

41
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,070
It's not this way! Go back, go back!

42
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,880
It's only gas - how is it outpacing me?!

43
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,840
Because you went the wrong way!

44
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,220
Keep still, you brats!

45
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,540
Sedate them already, G-5!

46
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,970
A few more to go, brother!

47
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,880
--Don't resist, children!
--Calm down!

48
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,820
Hey, hurry up, racoon! We don't have time...

49
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,530
Don’t give up, Mocha!

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,530
You can make it!

51
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,950
Mo... Momonosuke!

52
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,160
W-W-Wait, Kin'emon-san!

53
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
If you go that way, you'll run into the gas!

54
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,290
I don't even see any soldiers,
let alone my people!

55
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,280
What was that creepy room?!

56
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,050
What's this door?

57
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,830
I hear something...

58
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,080
...or not.

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
Master! Look!

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,940
That's Brownbeard!

61
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,880
I thought he was captured by Straw Hat.

62
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,090
--He looks okay.
--Good, good.

63
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,150
The Video Transponder Snail is running.

64
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,220
That means...

65
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Soldiers of Punk Hazard! Listen!

66
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,290
I know you're watching me somewhere!

67
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,750
You're all being fooled!

68
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,380
Caesar is telling you nothing but lies!

69
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,090
You're all gonna die if you stay here!

70
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,300
What is he talking about?

71
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,260
Has he gone crazy after being
captured by the Straw Hats?

72
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,310
Brownbeard is on the floor
below - R Building 1st floor.

73
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,320
But the Straw Hats and Navy
soldiers will arrive there

74
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,560
soon according to your plan.

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,660
Should we tell Brownbeard to come up here?

76
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,530
I'll tell you the truth about Caesar!

77
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,610
No, I'll go down.

78
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,370
We're coming with you then.

79
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,290
Caesar!

80
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,340
Oh, my dear underling - Brownbeard!

81
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm glad that you got away from Straw Hat!

82
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
Are you alright?

83
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,390
You look awful!

84
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Don't touch me!

85
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,310
Oh? Why are you in such a bad mood?

86
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,690
What's wrong?

87
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,410
I want my people back!

88
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,120
We got robbed at the center of
the island but they didn't die!

89
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,910
I'm sure they're back already!

90
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,370
Whoa-whoa, he's messing with the Master.

91
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,550
Huh? Your people?

92
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,540
Oh yeah...

93
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,340
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

94
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,550
Clank!

95
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,180
M-M-Master!

96
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,680
Master!

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,430
What's going on?

98
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,680
Oh, you must be one of Brownbeard's.

99
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,800
Master! There are Navy soldiers at
the main entrance and it's closed!

100
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,030
We can't get inside! Please guide us!

101
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,280
Oh no! That's serious!

102
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,580
Let me see what I can do! Wait there!

103
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,000
Th-Thank you very much, Master!

104
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,200
Master...

105
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,080
Master, how are you going to let them in?

106
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,360
Forget about it.

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,510
Shinokuni will be inescapable
out there soon enough.

108
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,580
I wonder what happened to them.

109
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,270
They don't even call me anymore.

110
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,600
If they're not here, they must be...

111
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,530
Are you worried? I think you are.

112
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,740
If they were out there, they're
definitely dead because of Shinokuni!

113
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,120
What'd you say?!

114
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,710
Screw you!

115
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,420
Hey, what're you doing, Brownbeard?!

116
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,510
Brownbeard?!

117
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,270
I can't trust your words anymore!

118
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,520
--What happened to him?!
--What is he doing to the Master?!

119
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll tell you guys this

120
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,670
because we spent the last two
years together on this island.

121
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,620
Leave the island now!

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,320
Do you wanna know what he
called you behind your back?!

123
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,410
This was his special name for you!

124
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,530
Guinoa pags.

125
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,400
Guinoo pah!

126
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,550
Guinoa poh...

127
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,130
Guinoh... Guinah...

128
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,640
What're you trying to say, Brownbeard?!

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,480
--Speak clearly!
--Is it some kind of spell?!

130
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,480
He's a funny guy!

131
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,690
Guinoh...

132
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,860
I don't know what you're saying!

133
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,530
They will keep following me
thinking I'm their savior!

134
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,740
They don't know that I kept them
alive because they're my guinea pigs!

135
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,000
I said "Guinea pigs"!

136
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,420
Why?! I got tongue-tied!

137
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,800
You did something, didn't you, Caesar?!

138
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,740
Oh, what is it this time?!

139
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,570
Are you putting on an act?!

140
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,040
Oh, are you okay? Huh?

141
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,330
It's a muscle relaxant.

142
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,860
You're losing strength around your mouth

143
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,440
and your whole body, aren't you?

144
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,040
Oh yeah, I remember now, Brownbeard.

145
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,500
About your former subordinates...

146
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,060
I let them die!

147
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,040
You asshole!

148
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,900
How dare you!

149
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,360
How dare you kill my people!

150
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,010
Oh, there is another thing
that I'd like to tell you.

151
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,430
The chemical weapon explosion
that nearly killed all

152
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,810
these soldiers four years ago?

153
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,070
I was the one who caused it!

154
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,250
It wasn't Vegapunk?!

155
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,670
This bastard did harm to everybody
and pretended that he saved them?!

156
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,940
Hey, stop! Stop it!

157
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,040
Help me! Brownbeard is going crazy!

158
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,270
Run, everybody!

159
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,370
Everything that's been going on this
island is all staged by Caesar!

160
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,120
Run, guys! He's a devil disguised as a human!

161
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,820
Hey, Brownbeard!

162
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,330
How could you do that to
a person who saved you?!

163
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,800
Oh no! He's really dangerous!

164
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,650
It's too late!

165
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,260
I guess Straw Hat did something to him!

166
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,310
Brownbeard!

167
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,520
Shoot! Shoot him! He's gonna attack you guys!

168
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,360
Shoot!

169
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,360
Now, let me finish him off.

170
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
Gastane...

171
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,090
Oh?

172
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,450
Did we make it out of that hole?

173
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,780
Yeah.

174
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,700
You climbed that wall to the top, huh?

175
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,850
Shoot!

176
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,390
Now, let me finish him off.

177
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,100
Momo, stay back!

178
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,980
Gastane...

179
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,490
Master!

180
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,410
Oh, that was close!

181
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,950
It grazed my body!

182
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,920
Dammit! Who is it?!

183
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,990
It's Straw Hat...

184
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,820
...Luffy!

185
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,210
His kindness saved my life
as it did to the others.

186
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,310
The Master was our warm-hearted savior!

187
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,000
Return to 2nd floor, everyone!

188
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,470
The Straw Hats and the
Navy will be here soon!

189
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,340
--Get ready for the experiment!
--Yes, sir!

190
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,570
Broadcast it for the brokers!

191
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,470
--Let's go!
--Hustle!

192
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,120
I assume they'll all be dead in five years.

193
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,480
So we need to find more kids.

194
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,390
Luffy! It was him!

195
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,810
He was the one who were talking about...

196
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,200
...harming those kindhearted children!

197
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,240
I know.

198
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,630
People on this island were tricked
into being here, weren't they?

199
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,340
What is this island?!

200
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,560
All right.

201
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,600
You don't know anything so let me
tell you the secret of this island.

202
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,830
--There's no sound!
--Hurry up!

203
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,770
--Checking the video!
--Pull the elevator up!

204
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,160
This island is like gas or air.

205
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,360
An island that doesn't seem to exist.

206
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,210
Do you get it?

207
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,010
Listen, this island shouldn't even exist.

208
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,090
That's why it's suitable to the
work of an underground community.

209
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,060
It's an epicenter of evil science.

210
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,810
We can do unlawful experiments or get
test subjects illegally as we like!

211
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,890
We have some powerful people backing us

212
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,070
and they'll cover up everything.

213
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,870
So no one out there would know a thing.

214
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,330
No matter how much you cry or scream,

215
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,870
no one will come to the rescue.

216
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,670
You don't know a damn thing
about this island, Straw Hat!

217
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,880
If you're getting involved without taking
it seriously, you'll end up dead!

218
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,590
Allying with Law is also not a good idea.

219
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,890
He wants to mess with SAD.

220
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,720
He is using you to kidnap me because I'm

221
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,380
the only person who can create SAD.

222
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,270
Let me tell you about SAD, Straw Hat.

223
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,110
The most dangerous Warlord - Don
Quixote Doflamingo owns this factory

224
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,540
and here, SAD is processed
into a fruit called "SMILE."

225
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,530
Do you know what SMILE is?

226
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,000
We successfully recreated a Devil Fruit!

227
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,240
SMILE is a Zoan type, man-made Devil Fruit.

228
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,680
Anyone who wants to become
powerful yearns for it.

229
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,340
Doflamingo is selling SMILEs
to big-timers in the New World.

230
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,870
I heard one of the Four Emperors
is already on the move...

231
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,840
...to form an army of hundreds
of Devil Fruit eaters with SMILE.

232
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,300
Doesn't it send a chill down your spine?

233
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,690
Do you understand what you're dealing with?

234
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:59,340
By interfering with Doflamingo's business,
you'll piss so many big names off.

235
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,570
When they start going into action,
it's gonna shake up the whole world.

236
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,550
And that's what Law wants.

237
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,090
What fools!

238
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,970
They're out of your league!

239
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,600
Catch me if you can! But I'm protected!

240
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,680
Doflamingo! The Four Emperors!

241
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,320
Do you even have balls to
pick a fight with them?

242
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,210
I don't think so!

243
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,030
If you wanna run, do it now!

244
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,540
Get out of my face!

245
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,750
A fight?

246
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,320
Wow!

247
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,280
I've been...

248
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,250
...picking fights all along!

249
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,630
Undaunted by the powerful Gas Gas Fruit attacks...

250
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,840
...Luffy corners Caesar with his fists of rage.

251
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,070
But elsewhere, Smoker,

252
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,390
facing another powerful Haki user,

253
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,600
is fighting an overwhelmingly losing battle...

254
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,890
...and lies on the verge of death and defeat.

255
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

256
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,330
"A Surprising Outcome!
White Chase vs. Vergo!"

257
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,490
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
