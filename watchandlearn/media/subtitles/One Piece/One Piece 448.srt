2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,810
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,840
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,820
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,160
While breaking out, Luffy and others
ran into the Warlord--Blackbeard...

53
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,080
...at the staircase in level 4!

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm gonna save Ace at any cost!

55
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah, I'm not gonna say that it's a waste!

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,690
Anything is possible in this world!

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,170
I told you that the Sky Island exists!

58
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,530
And so does the One Piece!
It certainly exists!

59
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,700
You all should look forward to this!

60
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,380
In a few hours, we're going to...

61
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,590
...put on a show that's
gonna shake the whole world!

62
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,090
Don't stop, Luffy-kun!

63
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,140
Keep going!

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,480
To level 3!

65
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
Are you Magellan?!

66
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,410
So you're Blackbeard?!

67
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,030
Yes, indeed!

68
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,200
Hydra!

69
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,510
Ouch! What is this?!

70
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,640
Straw Hat! How did you survive
after I poisoned you?!

71
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,860
He's probably the one who
caused this situation!

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,780
I must take his life for sure this time!

73
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,140
Straw Hat!

74
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,790
That poison bastard!

75
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,490
I will never let you get out of this prison!

76
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,830
"Stop Magellan! Ivan-san's
Esoteric Technique Explodes!"

77
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,790
Straw-chan! Don't look back! Keep running!

78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,640
I won't let you get away!

79
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,310
Hurry up!

80
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,690
Hurry! Magellan's right there!

81
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,610
Let's go all the way to level 2!

82
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,960
This is the last group!

83
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,610
Behind these ones, no one is...

84
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,010
...left standing!

85
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,750
Inazuma!

86
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,760
Alright!

87
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,480
Great Scissors!

88
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,210
Inazuma-san!

89
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,590
Why did you cut the staircase?!

90
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,170
Ivan-sama hasn't come up yet!

91
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,300
Don't worry! Just keep moving!

92
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,140
Ivan-san!

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,500
Please be safe!

94
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,190
What are you trying to do here?

95
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
What am I trying to do?

96
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,070
If you really can't tell
what I'm trying to do...

97
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,190
...you must be very...

98
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,650
...stupid!

99
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,440
Death Wink!

100
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,580
Heehaw!

101
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,150
Now things are getting serious!

102
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,360
Even if you buy yourself some time,

103
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,070
Straw Hat and others can't get out of here!

104
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,960
"Buy some time?"

105
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,660
So you think that you can beat me?

106
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,380
Kamabakka style - New Kama Kempo!

107
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,340
Feast your eyes on this!

108
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,280
Kama!

109
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,020
Heehaw!

110
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,180
Hey hey! Come on now!

111
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,960
Heehaw!

112
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,680
Long underpants!

113
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,640
Chemise!

114
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,590
It's odd! The poison bastard
was right behind us while ago!

115
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,360
I saw Ivan-san and Inazuma
stopped in the lower level!

116
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,480
What?!

117
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,150
So they're fighting the poison
bastard! Let's go back!

118
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,570
Gimme a break!

119
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,830
If they're fighting, we gotta keep moving!

120
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,240
You have to believe in the
power of the miracle-worker!

121
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,420
Spin, spin!

122
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,130
What's wrong with this floor?
They can't be this lax.

123
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,460
It's strange! I don't see
any prisoners in the cells!

124
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,040
And all the doors are open!

125
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,390
I wonder who released them!

126
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,110
Come on, get out! Let's
get back on the street!

127
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,040
Thank you, Captain Buggy!

128
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes! I'm so glad!

129
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,900
I'm out!

130
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,160
You gotta do your part!

131
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,300
--Here you go!
--Thanks!

132
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,600
Take this!

133
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,200
Shoot! Shoot!

134
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,090
Keep going! Keep it up!

135
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,320
Come on, get out! Let's
get back on the street!

136
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,190
Thank you, Captain Buggy!

137
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,860
Yes! I'm so glad!

138
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm out!

139
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,820
You gotta do your part!

140
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,410
--Here you go!
--Thanks!

141
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,410
Take this!

142
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,590
Keep going! Keep it up!

143
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,140
Luckily getting out of level 2
blocked by Magellan's poison,

144
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,390
Captain Buggy and merry prisoners
are heading to the main entrance.

145
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,930
They're on level 1.

146
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,870
Running through level 4--the Burning Heat
Hell and level 3--the Starving Hell,

147
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,780
the mob of New Kamas led by Straw Hat
Luffy and the assembled freed prisoners...

148
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,610
...are now running through
level 2 - the Wild Beast Hell.

149
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,260
And Warden Magellan who was on their tail...

150
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,080
...is fighting with the queen
of queers Ivankov in level 3!

151
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,960
M-My spine has... mmm... got hurt!

152
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,800
D-Damn Ivankov!

153
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,810
Heehaw!

154
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,850
That's unforgivable!

155
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,890
Get them right now!

156
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,280
How long... mmm... are
you gonna keep sleeping?!

157
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,340
And the 4 demon guards who have been
beaten but come back repeatedly...

158
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,840
...are heading to level 1 by elevator.

159
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,300
Jail Manager Shiryu who switched
sides cut all communication lines

160
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,930
so no one would find out the
situation inside the prison.

161
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,310
Those unprecedented dramatic events keep
expanding literally behind closed doors.

162
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,940
Navy ships and prison ships are
anchored around the prison!

163
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,620
If we're able to steal one of them, we can
get to Marineford before Ace-san's execution!

164
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,790
Great! Wait for me, Ace!

165
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,250
Ace's imminent public execution is...

166
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,540
...in 4 and a half hours!

167
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:20,140
My face... My face is gonna melt!

168
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,070
My face... My face...

169
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,650
My face... My face... My face is...

170
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,280
...gonna melt... melt... melt...

171
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,240
...Or not! Because I've
got so much make up on!

172
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,200
"It's not gonna melt?!" Heehaw!

173
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,680
"You got me there!" Heehaw!

174
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,170
Heehaw!

175
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,840
Death Wink!

176
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,510
Wink! Wink!

177
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,600
Death Wink! Wink! Wink!

178
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,640
Wink! Wink! Wink!

179
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,940
Wink! Wink! Wink!

180
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,750
Wink! Wink!

181
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,210
Venom Blowfish!

182
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,540
The lace... My bootlace...

183
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,780
...came loose... loose...

184
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,050
...loose... loose... loose...

185
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,720
...Or not! Because they're laceless!

186
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,020
Heehaw!

187
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,100
"There's no lace?!" Heehaw!

188
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,890
"You got me there!" Heehaw!

189
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,220
This is foolish.

190
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,230
What?

191
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,150
It's foolish of you trying to gain some time!

192
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,200
You think so? I'm having so much fun!

193
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,740
Alright then, let's get it over with.

194
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,960
Between you...

195
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,920
...and me!

196
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,920
New Kama Kempo: 44 - Aesthetic Technique!

197
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,640
Hair Removal Fist!

198
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,650
Ivan-san!

199
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,470
Venom Road!

200
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,650
Ivan-san!

201
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,780
Oh no...

202
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,660
Keep Out!

203
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,580
Are you here to stall me, too?

204
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,590
Here they are!

205
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,060
The 4 demon guards all
together after all this time!

206
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,350
Run!

207
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,330
It's over! Let's go back!
We can't fight them!

208
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,890
Let's just forget about breaking out!

209
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,530
What?!

210
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,520
Hey, are you okay?

211
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,990
You bastard! What are you...

212
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,610
...dile?!

213
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,680
B-B-B-B-Boss!

214
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,840
Huh?

215
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,170
Oh, it's you, Mr. 3.

216
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,420
What are you doing here, you useless trash?

217
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,180
W-Who released this pain in the butt?!

218
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,040
C-Captain Buggy!

219
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,000
They KO'd the demon guards!

220
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,690
What?!

221
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,620
S-S-Straw Hat?!

222
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,890
T-That's the Warlord Jimbei!

223
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,360
Good! You guys are okay!

224
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,330
GOOD! YOU GUYS ARE OKAY!

225
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,410
It breaks...

226
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,240
...My heart!

227
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,190
Captain Buggy!

228
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,000
A bunch of prisoners and perverts

229
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,920
are
coming up one after another from level 2!

230
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,090
Perverts, too?! What the hell?!

231
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,340
Who are you calling perverts?!

232
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,130
You two! This is for walking
out on us back there!

233
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,220
You're here, too, Mr. 2!

234
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,430
What're you doing to Captain Buggy?!

235
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,560
This is no good!

236
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,770
These level 4 prisoners
came all the way up here at last!

237
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,120
They managed to get away
from Warden Magellan?!

238
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,900
Jeez! We allowed two riots at the same time!

239
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,150
Where's Warden now?!

240
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,280
Hydra!

241
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,880
Magellan's here, too!

242
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
What's going on on this floor?!

243
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,300
What?! Then Ivan-chan and Crab-chan are...

244
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,960
Finally, Magellan catches up to Luffy and the others.

245
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,630
Luffy, in order to help the others off level 1,

246
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,740
holds Magellan at bay with the aid of Mr. 3.

247
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,810
Meanwhile, Jinbei makes it to the entrance with the prisoners,

248
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,560
but Magellan has one more thing up his sleeve!

249
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

250
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,360
"Magellan's Tricky Move!
A Foiled Escape Plan!"

251
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
