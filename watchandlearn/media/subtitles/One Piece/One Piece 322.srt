00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,980
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,760
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,250
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,380
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,400
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,220
If you really intend to take him with you...

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,230
...do whatever it takes.

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,480
Take him by force!

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,270
That's the only way to free him!

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,530
"Goodbye My Dear Underlings!
Franky Departs"

39
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,180
Put something on!

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,100
You perv!

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,640
How dare you destroy the town again?!

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,230
Leave town, you perv!

43
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,160
You good-for-nothing!

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,570
Give me my swimsuit back, Straw Hat.

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,370
Then join us!

46
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,160
Don't be silly! You think
you can make me join you

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,000
just by stealing my swimsuit?!

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,820
Yow!

49
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,420
"Nothing should phase men."

50
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,130
Nothing should phase men.

51
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,340
"A man should be resourceful,
even with only the skin on his back."

52
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,460
A man should be resourceful,
even with only the skin on his back.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,930
"He should be like a lion that
stands against the waves!"

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,990
He should be like a lion that
stands against the waves!

55
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,520
He struck a pose, completely
exposing his private parts!

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,110
Don't look at him!

57
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,650
He's the worst... He's the worst!

58
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,700
I underestimated him!
What a strong-willed guy he is!

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,240
He's a man among men!

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,620
He's just a total perv!

61
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,580
If it's okay to get rough
with him, I can help you.

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,060
What?

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,730
Come to think of it, Ice pops said that we
had no choice but to take him by force.

64
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,010
But how?

65
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,970
Dos Fleurs...

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,510
What?

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Grab!

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,870
What?! Hey, Robin!

69
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,710
You grabbed them! Ouch!

70
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,170
--You're gonna crush them, Robin!
--Ow, ow, ow...!

71
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,270
They're gonna come off!

72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,100
They're gonna be plucked off!

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,110
Just like tangerines!

74
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,420
Hey, Robin! I want him to still
be a man when he joins us!

75
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,820
Don't tear them off!

76
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,630
It hurts just to watch!

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,720
What's going on?! Franky's in pain!

78
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,180
What's this gut-wrenching cry?!
It sounds like he's on the verge of death!

79
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,260
I kinda feel sorry for him...

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,390
...even though he's a perv.

81
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,660
If you're telling us, pirates, to give up
the treasure right in front of us,

82
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,860
we can't back off unless
you give us a good reason.

83
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,230
L-Like I said...

84
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,720
...I-I wanna stay on this island!

85
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,840
I-I do appreciate you guys!
In fact, I can't thank you enough!

86
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,640
I wanna go with you and help you out,

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,410
but there's something I need to do here.

88
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,680
That's why I gave you the ship as a gift!

89
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,280
Besides, I'm not a shipwright
anymore in the first place!

90
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,990
So that ship is the last ship I'll ever build!

91
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,150
It was my long-cherished desire.

92
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,930
That, indeed, is a dream ship!

93
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,440
Hold it, Franky.

94
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,490
I don't think that ship has become
the dream ship you're referring to yet.

95
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,720
A dream ship?

96
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,210
That's right! Blueprints alone
can't complete that ship!

97
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,650
After setting sail, it has to cross many seas

98
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,170
and overcome many battles and hardships...

99
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,680
...before it reaches the end of the sea.
After doing all those things,

100
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,690
then you can finally call it a dream ship.

101
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,520
And when my best ship is completed one day,

102
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,810
I'll board that ship as a shipwright

103
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,840
in order to witness that fated day.

104
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,920
By that day, the ship will
probably be falling apart,

105
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,660
but I'm sure that it'll be
giving off a magnificent light!

106
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,210
What do you think? Isn't that great, Tom-san?

107
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,940
Yeah, that's great!

108
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,720
If you also become a sailor, you'll beat me.

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,130
I wonder if your pirate blood is affecting you.

110
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,530
Ha! Moron-ky, someone like
you can't surpass Tom-san!

111
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,470
What'd you say?!

112
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,450
What're you doing, you Moron-ky?!

113
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,430
Ribbit, ribbit.

114
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, if you're a man, do it resolutely!

115
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,440
What I wanna do has changed!

116
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,030
What you wanna do? That's not true.

117
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,280
Everything you're doing on
this island right now is...

118
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,040
...atonement.

119
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,470
You're still regretting that Tom-san
was taken that day because of you.

120
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,430
But Tom-san had already
forgiven you on that day...

121
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,520
...and tried to guide you.

122
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,590
Ships that would do something like that...
They're no longer my ships!

123
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,160
Tom-san... hit Franky for the first time...

124
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,120
What'd you do that for?!

125
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,530
"They're no longer my ships," you say?

126
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,760
You can say anything but that!

127
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,370
What's wrong with saying that?!
I'm regretting it!

128
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,310
If only those ships didn't exist,
no one would have had to get hurt!

129
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,700
No matter what kind of ship it is,
the act of building it...

130
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,910
...is neither an act of good nor evil!

131
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,660
I don't care what kind of
ships you choose to build,

132
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,830
but even if the ships you built hurt someone,

133
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,870
or even if they destroy the world,

134
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,580
at least the one who created
them must love them!

135
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,520
Their creator mustn't deny them!

136
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,300
Don't blame the ships!

137
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,460
A man should be resolutely proud...
of the ships he created!

138
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,740
That you brought the punks
on the backstreets together...

139
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,230
That you called yourself a bounty hunter
and protected this island from looters...

140
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,950
You did all that to protect this
city of water that Tom-san loved,

141
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,910
which was your way of atoning...

142
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,830
...though it doesn't appear that way to others.

143
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,910
Of course it doesn't.

144
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,460
That's not why I did what I did at all!

145
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,830
Ow, ow, ow...!

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,060
You quit building ships,
which was your favorite thing to do,

147
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,070
and have lived suppressing yourself.

148
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,930
Are you going to live like that
for the rest of your life?

149
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,410
Even if Tom-san forgives you,
or even if I forgive you,

150
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,940
nothing is gonna change, is it...?

151
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,230
Isn't it about time...

152
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,830
...for you to forgive yourself, Franky?

153
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,040
Isn't it about time for you to
start living for your own dream?

154
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,770
What the heck?!

155
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,770
A bag?!

156
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,330
It has what you'll need for your journey, Bro!

157
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,180
Out of the way, you bastards!

158
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,510
It's the Franky Family!

159
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,700
--Bro!
--Bro!

160
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,160
Those guys...

161
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,330
Bro! Please forgive us for all that
stuff we pulled! We're really sorry!

162
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,780
We're sorry!

163
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,270
We're prepared to receive
any kind of punishment!

164
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,840
Since we're fools, we racked what
little brains we have thinking about it!

165
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,060
Just what did you rack what little
brains you have thinking about?!

166
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,470
How to steal my swimsuit? Well?!

167
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,730
How to make me a pirate?!
Mind your own business!

168
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,190
It's my life! No one can decide it but me!

169
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,740
How can I, your boss, willingly walk
on the way paved by my underlings?!

170
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,380
That's shameful!

171
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,010
If your brains are so small, then don't
try to use them in the first place!

172
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,920
I-I'm sorry. But...

173
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,440
...aren't we even allowed to think a little?

174
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,630
We're deeply indebted to you
for taking in thugs like us.

175
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,220
Aren't we even allowed to
think about your happiness?!

176
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,560
Who's the fool here?

177
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,530
You guys are all...

178
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,880
Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

179
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,530
--B-Bro!
--Ow, ow, ow, ow...

180
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,740
--Ow, ow, ow, ow...!
--H-Hey, Robin!

181
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,460
Go easy on him! Please!
You're gonna make him a woman!

182
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,960
He's crying!

183
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,340
They're gonna come off!

184
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,800
They're gonna be plucked off!

185
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,260
Just like grapes!

186
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,470
Ow, grapes!

187
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,180
Damn you, Nico Robin!
You're not gonna get away with this!

188
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,690
They're gonna come off!

189
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,150
They're gonna be plucked off!

190
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,610
Just like apples!

191
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,110
Ah... pples...

192
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,610
My tears won't stop because of the pain!

193
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,420
Robin!

194
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,790
H-Huh? You aren't doing anything?

195
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,310
I only did it once, the very first time.

196
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,800
How sly of him to pretend
that he's crying out of pain.

197
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,710
--What?
--Just once?

198
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,160
Dammit! Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

199
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,310
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

200
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,370
It hurts so bad I can't stop the tears!

201
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,130
You still haven't found them yet?!

202
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,550
Don't let them get away no matter what!
Look far and wide for them!

203
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,510
It hurts! It hurts! I can't stop the tears!

204
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,910
Bro!

205
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,940
Are you okay?!

206
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,230
How could I be okay?!

207
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,700
I've never seen you around.
What's with you, bikini guy?

208
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,110
Don't be so stuck-up on these backstreets.

209
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,040
Get him!

210
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,890
Wh... What the hell?!

211
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,680
How dare you mock us?!

212
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,690
You're quite strong. You're just
wasting that strength by being a thug.

213
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,610
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

214
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,030
Zambai!

215
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,950
I'm Franky. I've decided to make the
backstreets of Water Seven my turf.

216
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,040
Nice meeting you!

217
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,000
Y-Yes, sir.

218
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,960
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

219
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,590
Bro!

220
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,050
I'm feeling great!

221
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,320
Let's go to one more bar!

222
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,030
Hey, you over there with the stylish bikini!

223
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,450
Let's have a drink together.

224
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,190
We'll take you to a bar.

225
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,420
Wh-What're you doing?!

226
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,740
Let go of us!

227
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,980
You young girls, don't sponge booze
from others in broad daylight!

228
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,960
I know a place that serves good cola!

229
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,790
Why don't you come with me?

230
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,760
Bro! Bro!

231
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,640
G-Give me something to eat.

232
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,190
Bring everyone who has nothing to eat!

233
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,560
Go as nuts as you want!

234
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,080
We're starting the Franky Family!

235
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,550
Yeah!

236
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,000
--It's our start!
--It's our start!

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,840
--We're the Franky Family!
--We're the Franky Family!

238
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,800
Yahoo!

239
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,870
Franky! Franky! Franky!

240
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:10,730
Franky! Franky! Franky!...

241
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,180
Can you... live without me?!

242
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,660
Bro...

243
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,590
The face of the Water Seven underworld...

244
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,730
We'll work together to take
over that role splendidly!

245
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,080
So don't worry!

246
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,670
Don't cry, Bro!

247
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,640
Bro!

248
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,610
No matter how far you go,

249
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,120
we're your underlings for the rest of our lives!

250
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
Bro!

251
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,270
Ow, ow, ow...

252
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,140
I can't stop the tears!

253
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,770
Hurry!

254
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,980
This isn't good.

255
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,900
Luffy!

256
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,360
Ah! Zoro! Sanji!

257
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,370
We've got trouble!

258
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,950
Your grandpa is back, Luffy!

259
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,350
They're at the opposite seashore.

260
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,080
They're looking for us now!
They're going to attack us!

261
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,040
What?! Why?! I thought he said
he wasn't gonna capture us.

262
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,920
How would we know?!
Hurry up and get ready to set sail!

263
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,180
Whoa!

264
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,140
Franky! You still haven't
put on your swimsuit yet?!

265
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,850
I'm giving this back!

266
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,530
Now, come on board, Franky...

267
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,820
Board my ship.

268
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,540
Don't be so cocky!

269
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,780
You guys are total amateurs who
could only manage makeshift repairs!

270
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,500
It'd be a pity for such a magnificent ship
not to have a shipwright on board.

271
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,590
I guess I don't have much choice
but to help you guys out!

272
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,220
I, Franky, will be the shipwright on your ship!

273
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,680
All right! We've got a new crew member!

274
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,220
Yay! All right!

275
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,940
Bro...!

276
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,940
Don't cry! Don't cry!

277
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,400
Straw Hat is a man we can trust!

278
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,930
Tom-san... I'm leaving this island.

279
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,830
Say, teach me how to draw
blueprints for a pirate ship!

280
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,670
What's so funny?

281
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,970
Aren't you going to bed yet, Tom-san?

282
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,930
What're you drawing?

283
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,390
Mm... It's this island's hope.

284
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,270
Hope?

285
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,730
I wasn't a good disciple. I always
caused you nothing but trouble, but...

286
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,510
Did you guys hear about the scrap heap island?!

287
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,030
Tom's Workers has finished
building the sea train, you say?!

288
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,990
Thank you for everything!

289
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,730
Galley-La's foremen...

290
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,690
Take good care of Iceberg!

291
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,650
I've caused you nothing
but trouble, too, Iceberg.

292
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,660
Old hag Kokoro, little one and bunny...

293
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,000
R-Ribbit...

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
Yokozuna...

295
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,490
Perv!

296
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,900
--Lively townspeople...
--Where're you going?!

297
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,080
You're coming back, aren't you?!

298
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,990
My little sisters...

299
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Sodom... Gomorrah...

300
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,470
And... my dear underlings...

301
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,770
I'm stepping out for a bit!

302
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,000
Put on your swimsuit.

303
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,380
What?! Usopp's coming back?!

304
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,050
Really?! All right!

305
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,100
Okay, then! Let's go get him right away!

306
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,280
Hold it, you guys!

307
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,980
--What?
--I won't allow any of us to go get him.

308
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

309
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,750
"Departing the City of Water!
Usopp Mans Up and Brings Closure to the Duel!"

310
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,340
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
