00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,710
Everyone, come here! This is bad!

22
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,910
Huh? What is it, Vivi?

23
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,940
It's Nami-san! She has a terrible fever!

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
I have a favor to ask of everyone.

25
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,470
I know it's not my place to ask
this as a passenger on your ship,

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,170
but my homeland is in a terrible
state now, so I'd like to hurry ahead!

27
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,370
We can't waste even a single minute!

28
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,610
So I want this ship to head for
Alabasta at its fastest speed!

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,870
Of course! That's what we promised!

30
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,800
So let's find an island with
a doctor on it right away!

31
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,290
Let's cure Nami-san as quickly as
possible and then go to Alabasta!

32
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,720
That's this ship's fastest speed, right?!

33
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,400
Yeah! We can't go any faster than that!

34
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,200
"A Raid! The Tin Tyrant
and Tin Plate Wapol"

35
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,880
She needs to see a doctor
as quickly as possible...

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,080
At this rate, Nami-san will...

37
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,860
Hey!

38
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you see a doctor?!

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,700
Do you expect him to, you idiot?

40
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,040
Hey, guys. Do you think...
people can stand on the ocean?

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,060
Can people stand on the ocean?

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,640
C'mon, Zoro! What kind
of question is that?

43
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,390
Then... what's that?!

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,530
Huh?

45
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,100
What's what?

46
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,260
Hi. It sure is chilly today.

47
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,070
Yeah! It is chilly today!

48
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,480
Y-yeah! Chilly, chilly!
Today's very chilly!

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,060
Really?

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,160
Increase buoyancy!

51
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,150
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,470
What is that?! A watermelon?!

53
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,950
Why are we shaking?!

54
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,670
Hold the rudder! If anything
happens to Nami, I'll gut you all!

55
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't tell me this... is a ship?!

56
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,330
Crap! A p-pirate ship!

57
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,200
W-wow!

58
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,920
Just when we're in a hurry...

59
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:41,130
Did our jumbo underwater raid ship,
the Tin Tyrant, surprise you?!

60
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,590
Vivi-chan! You're in charge here!

61
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,430
Okay!

62
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,280
Hey! What's going on?!

63
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,420
So? What's going on?

64
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,130
The ship's being attacked.

65
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,230
Well, I had figured as much,
from the looks of things.

66
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,110
Are you really pirates? You're strange.

67
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,510
Is it just you four?

68
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,410
I find it hard to believe...

69
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,860
that a pirate group
would only have four people.

70
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,550
What is that guy?!
He even ate the knife!

71
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,920
Just watching hurts!

72
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,020
Well, no matter.
I'll start by asking this...

73
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,770
We want to go to the Drum Kingdom.

74
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,430
Do you happen to have an
Eternal Pose or a Log Pose?

75
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,490
Nope. Never even heard of the place.

76
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,680
Okay, you're done, right?! So leave!

77
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,940
We're in a hurry! We don't
have time to mess with you!

78
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,880
Don't rush life like that.

79
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,850
But if you have neither, then oh well.

80
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,620
For now, I'll take your
treasure and this ship.

81
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,490
What?!

82
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,750
But first, I'm feeling a bit hungry!

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,260
What is this guy?!

84
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,900
Don't eat our ship!

85
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,150
Hold it right there!
Wapol-sama is currently eating!

86
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,960
Shut up!

87
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
Damn that bastard! Fire!

88
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,680
Should've done that
from the very start...

89
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,340
Oh? We can have at 'em?

90
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,340
No, wait! We can discuss this!

91
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,990
They started it themselves...

92
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,200
The fools! They're in a hurry to die!

93
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,310
Gunfire?!

94
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,770
Karoo! Watch Nami-san!
I'll be right back!

95
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,180
Don't do anything you can't handle!

96
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,460
Reception!

97
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,770
All bark and no bite...

98
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,480
W- Wapol-sama! These guys're--!

99
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,230
Are you still eating it?!

100
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,060
Say, this ship doesn't taste half bad...

101
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,070
Hey, you!

102
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,310
Fool! You're no match for Wapol-sama!

103
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,620
Time to get eaten by the power
of the Munch-Munch Fruit!

104
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,870
Luffy!

105
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,080
W-what is this?!

106
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,350
Oh, hey, Vivi-chan.
Has something happened to Nami-san?

107
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,060
Eh?

108
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,430
What a hard-to-chew person!

109
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,420
Why, you--!

110
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,140
Go flying!

111
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Wapol-sama?

112
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,060
Hey, this is bad!
Wapol-sama was sent flying!

113
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,460
This is terrible!
Wapol-sama is unable to swim!

114
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,420
He will surely perish if we
don't rescue him before he sinks!

115
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,300
This isn't over, you!
We will make you pay for this!

116
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
Remember us!

117
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,400
We'll get you for this!

118
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,210
Please, remember us! Please!

119
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,560
W-what was that just now?
They seemed to call him Wapol, but...

120
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
Doesn't matter. Don't worry about it.

121
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,850
He's just a moron.
That's the only possible explanation.

122
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,970
Have I seen him somewhere before?

123
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:02,040
"Several days earlier..."

124
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,620
Captain Smoker! Captain Smoker!

125
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,010
I've just intercepted
an intriguing signal!

126
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,470
What?

127
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,930
What an incredible full temper!

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,220
The Ryo-Wazamono sword, Kashu!

129
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,010
Tashigi! Hey! Tashigi!

130
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,220
Only in the Grand Line could
I find a legendary sword so quickly!

131
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,550
Tashigi! Hey!

132
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,600
Are you deaf, you sword freak?!

133
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,520
Y-yes, sir! What is it,
Captain Smoker?! Is coffee--

134
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,450
Just get over here and listen with us!

135
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,610
That's a Black Transponder Snail,
a listening device!

136
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,750
Listen close. We just picked up
this conversation between two men.

137
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,950
Ready, Sergeant Major? Here we go.

138
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,080
Y-yes. Please play it back.

139
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,320
...me, Mr. 0...

140
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
...Princess Vivi and the Straw Hat...

141
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,260
Straw Hat? The Straw Hat Pirates!

142
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,370
Yeah, mission complete!

143
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,670
...further orders...
via letter, as usual...

144
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,450
That is all. Good luck...

145
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,580
The rest is undecipherable.

146
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,450
It's a faint signal, but there are
four keywords in their conversation.

147
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:29,040
Princess Vivi. Straw Hat.
Orders via letter. And Mr. 0.

148
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,200
Mr. 0? Could that be a codename?!

149
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,100
If so, could he be connected to
that suspicious swordsman we caught

150
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,510
in Runess the other day?

151
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,540
With him... Mr. 11?

152
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,170
Yeah.

153
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,510
A criminal organization that
uses numbers for codenames

154
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,610
and sends orders via letter to
get tasks done. Sound about right?

155
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,550
Mr. 0? Criminal organization?
Dunno what you're talking about.

156
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,990
Don't give me your guesswork.

157
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,280
Then what was that letter with
orders that we found in your pocket?

158
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,230
I thought I burned that letter!

159
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,010
T-that was, uhh...

160
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,920
Oh? But there wasn't
anything in your pocket.

161
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,480
Princess Vivi...

162
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,510
That's the name of the princess
of Alabasta, as I recall.

163
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,310
She's currently missing.

164
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,780
Isn't the Alabasta Kingdom
in the middle of coup, too?

165
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,820
Could this mysterious criminal
organization and the Straw Hat Pirates

166
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,720
be involved in the uproar somehow?

167
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,730
Don't know. But this is the only
clue to Straw Hat's whereabouts

168
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,360
that we have right now.

169
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,000
Does that mean we're going to--?

170
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,890
Yeah. Contact HQ and
get an Eternal Pose!

171
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,460
Yes, sir!

172
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,890
Let's pay a visit to Alabasta,
the sand kingdom!

173
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,840
Are you sure she's not just hungry?

174
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,670
If so, she should eat
enough meat for 100 people!

175
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,010
Eating meat makes sickness go away!

176
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,080
Look, you...

177
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,440
Come on! Cheer up! Look! Look!

178
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,500
She isn't laughing... Not one bit...

179
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,590
Won't her fever go down
if we dump water on her?

180
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,320
You idiot!

181
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,720
This isn't good. The sun's about
to set for today, Vivi-chan.

182
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,840
Yes, you're right.
Let's drop anchor somewhere.

183
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,270
We can't navigate at night
without Nami-san's instructions.

184
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,340
Yeah.

185
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,420
Oh! You want my autograph that badly?!

186
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,570
Whew, it's cold...

187
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,480
Almost a full moon...

188
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,080
Brr! Oh, crap, I fell asleep!

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,460
You're up early, Usopp!

190
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,870
I can't just sit around doing nothing!

191
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,160
We gotta get out of this
jam as quick as possible!

192
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,760
Yeah. Good point.

193
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,500
Blehhh!

194
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,920
C'mon, Nami! Look!

195
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,160
This is weird. She won't smile!
C'mon, smile, Nami!

196
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,220
What's goin' on, Luffy?

197
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,990
"Meat"

198
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,930
Quit that! You're creepin' me out!

199
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,700
Really? Thanks!

200
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,070
Say, doesn't this area
seem kind of calm and cold?

201
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,570
Yeah, sudden, strange calms...

202
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,050
I guess that's another thing that
happens in the erratic Grand Line.

203
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,870
That's not necessarily so.

204
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,260
It's probably proof
that an island is nearby.

205
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,970
Sanji-san! Could you look
carefully out at the horizon?

206
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,650
Vivi-chan?

207
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,100
A winter island is nearby.
I'm certain of it.

208
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,820
Winter island?

209
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,610
Oww!

210
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,060
Climatically, there are four basic
types of islands in the Grand Line.

211
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,080
Summer islands, spring islands,
autumn islands, winter islands...

212
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,760
And each one generally has
four seasons of its own.

213
00:17:51,310 --> 00:18:02,790
"Summery Summer ----------- Wintery Winter"
"Summer Is. Spring Is. Autumn Is. Winter Is."

214
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,090
In short, when on the Grand Line,
there are at least 16 seasonal levels

215
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:03,360
you must conquer, from summer island
summer to winter island winter.

216
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,100
Of course, there are many
exceptions and unknown climates.

217
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
I get it.

218
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,100
The Grand Line has all these
different islands one after the other,

219
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,510
and that's why the seas between
them have such unstable weather.

220
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:25,450
That's right. Which is why stable
weather means an island is nearby.

221
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,540
Yeah... I see it!

222
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,640
We found an island!

223
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,670
An island?!

224
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,430
Oh! An island! We found an island!

225
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,630
Hey, Nami! Good for you!
There's an island! You can get better!

226
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,140
There's an island! An island! Island!

227
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Island! Island! Island! Island!

228
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,330
Just go look. I got her covered.

229
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,980
An island!

230
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,160
White! It's so white! It must
be snow! A snow island, huh?!

231
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,530
Hey, Luffy! Just so you know,
we're not here to have an adventure!

232
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,000
We're dropping by to find a doctor!

233
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,730
We're leaving once
we get Nami-san looked at!

234
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,600
Hey! Hey, Luffy!

235
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,620
Snow is so nice and white!

236
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,440
It's no use. He doesn't hear me...

237
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,110
H-h-hold on! Is this a good idea?!

238
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,110
If there's snow, couldn't
there be snow monsters too?!

239
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,350
Besides, we're not even sure
if people live there or not!

240
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,950
Oh, no! My chronic
Can't-Go-to-the-Island disease!

241
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,990
Snow! I love snow! It's white!

242
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,550
Guess I'll get us ready to land.

243
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,130
All this snow! I'm so happy!

244
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,560
This is really somethin'.
What's with those mountains?

245
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
Say, Luffy. Aren't you cold,
dressed like that?

246
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,520
It's -10° C right now!
That's when bears get ready to hibernate!

247
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,770
Huh? Oh.

248
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,370
So cold!

249
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,400
Took you long enough!

250
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,450
It's a waterfall of melted snow.
We may be able to stop around here.

251
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,260
So, who's going doctor-hunting?

252
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,630
No, I guess people-hunting comes first...

253
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,940
I'm going!

254
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,860
Me too!

255
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,330
Okay! Have fun!

256
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,550
That's far enough, pirates!

257
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,050
Hey. I found people.

258
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,220
But... they don't seem too friendly...

259
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,840
Attention, pirates! Leave this
place at once! This instant!

260
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,370
We came to find a doctor!

261
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,550
We have a sick person onboard!

262
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,000
We won't fall for that trick,
you filthy pirates!

263
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,720
This is our island!
We won't let any pirates land here!

264
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,240
Raise anchor and leave now!
Or else we'll blow your whole ship up!

265
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,180
They really hate our guts.
And we've just met, too...

266
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,780
Don't talk back!

267
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,470
They're shooting!

268
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,220
You didn't just do that!

269
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,480
Stop, Sanji-san!

270
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,480
Bastard!

271
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,890
Vivi!

272
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

273
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

274
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

275
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

276
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even,

277
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

278
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

279
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

280
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

281
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool,
but I gotta go

282
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

283
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool,
but I'm gonna fight

284
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

285
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,630
Do everything you can,

286
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,640
and you'll get a little nearer to any horizon

287
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,080
Okay! We're going up that mountain!
To see the witch!

288
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,790
Don't be crazy! That'd be fine
for you, but not for Nami!

289
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,250
We should treat her soon, right?

290
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,290
But look at how steep and high up it is!

291
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,110
We can make it!

292
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm counting on you, Captain...

293
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,430
Okay! Let's go! Before Nami dies!

294
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,660
Don't say things that could jinx us!

295
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,830
On the next episode of One Piece!

296
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,170
"An Island Without Doctors?
Adventure in a Nameless Land!"

297
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
