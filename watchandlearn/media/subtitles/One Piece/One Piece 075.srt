00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,610
Broggy-san!

22
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,580
Now, then! Accelerate, Candle Service!

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,690
Turn these people into wax figures!

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,820
My hands won't move!

25
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,130
I don't wanna die this way!
Can't we do something?!

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,530
Hey, old man.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,740
Whadya say we crush
these guys together?

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,910
I'll fight alongside you
and your fighting spirit!

29
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,010
Don't be stupid!
What can you possibly do?!

30
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm gonna kick your asses,
just so you know!

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,960
What?

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,560
These guys spoiled
the old giant guys' duel!

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,430
Master Broggy!
We've taken on your frustration!

34
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,570
Usopp...

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,800
For now, could you bust
this pillar for us, Luffy?

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,110
I leave the rest to you.

37
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,580
Alright, no problem!

38
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,540
I wouldn't be so sure.

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,450
Break the pillar, Luffy!

40
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,460
"A Hex on Luffy! Colors Trap"

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,790
Zoro! What are you doing?!

42
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,690
If I'm gonna be solidified,
I prefer this pose.

43
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,360
This is no time to be playing around!

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,230
I'm not playing.

45
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,400
Anyways, do something about your leg!
It's painful just looking at it!

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,470
Then quit looking at it.

47
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,970
You're the idiot who suggested
cutting our legs off in this situation

48
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,370
so we could escape!

49
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,080
That ain't true!

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,410
I was gonna cut 'em off
so we could fight.

51
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,380
That's even stupider! Get serious!

52
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,580
Just shut up!

53
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,020
Honestly! You have no common sense!

54
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,460
We still haven't even escaped
from this situation,

55
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,260
yet neither of them seems
to sense the danger at all...

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,740
Hey, runt. Is that all
the struggling you got?

57
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,340
Yeah. Looks like it's
someone else's turn now.

58
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,340
I see...

59
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,680
Mr. 3. Those people don't
seem concerned at all.

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,220
I could say the same about you,
Miss Golden Week!

61
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,020
Urgh!

62
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
Hey. If you're gonna do a pose,
now's your chance.

63
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Don't put me on your level.

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,630
Mr. Bushido! Please be
more serious about this!

65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,430
I'm always serious.

66
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,300
More like stupid.

67
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,410
--Like you're one to talk!
--It seems we're being mocked!

68
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,810
This is truly displeasing!

69
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,980
Ever since he showed up, they've been--

70
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,680
It couldn't be!

71
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,250
Alright!

72
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,190
He hardly seems to be
that reliable of a man.

73
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,260
Mr. 3!

74
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,990
We'll finish him off.

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,330
Finish him off?

76
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,760
Don't be silly.

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,270
Just look!

78
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,470
He showed up here alive and well
because your attacks don't work.

79
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,910
At the very least, he's at a level
that's too much for you to handle.

80
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,280
You two can take care of the others!

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,360
I think I'll add Straw Hat Luffy
to my wax figure collection...

82
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,860
You guys are too damn annoying!

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,770
You've gone a bit too far!
Give yourselves up!

84
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,670
Small fry.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,410
Let's do it!

86
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,180
Alright! Preparations are complete!
We got your back, Luffy!

87
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,450
Did you say something?

88
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,150
Now you're mine!

89
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,260
Candle Lock!

90
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,230
What is that?!

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,430
--Luffy-san!
--Damn. He's already gotten caught?!

92
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,670
Idiot!

93
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,540
What's this? It's heavy, like a mallet!

94
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,880
How simple.

95
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,550
Now for your hands!

96
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,680
Oh! This is perfect!

97
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,190
Candle Lock!

98
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,360
Whoa!

99
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,560
Old giant guy!

100
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,730
Sorry to bother you!

101
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,840
What?! What's he up to?!

102
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,380
Gum-Gum...

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,780
...Mallet!

104
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,320
He did it!

105
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,460
Yahoo!

106
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,550
Lucky! The mallet on my legs broke, too!

107
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
Huh? Huh?!

108
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,260
I'm alive...

109
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,000
We survived...

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
That didn't help things at all!

111
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Whew, that was dangerous!
Why didn't you guys run?

112
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,310
We can't move! Isn't it obvious?!

113
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,880
Oh? Really?

114
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,050
But you guys told me to break the pillar!

115
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,180
Were you lying?

116
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,750
Is it really a good idea to put our
lives in his hands, Mr. Bushido?!

117
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,790
Don't look at me.
That's the only choice we got here.

118
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,520
Plus it looks like my arms are stuck now.

119
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,190
Please be serious about this!

120
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,600
Hold on... It feels like my body
is hardening more and more now...

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,070
I can't move at all now...

122
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,790
Fools! With the candles closer,
your hardening has sped up!

123
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,020
Now you can become
wax figures even quicker!

124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,960
That guy thinks he can act
all smug and arrogant!

125
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,800
Hey! You guys are gonna be wax figures?

126
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,940
That's what we've been trying to tell you!

127
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,040
Just destroy this set, Luffy-san!

128
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,870
R-Right! Okay!

129
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,110
I told you, I won't let you interfere!

130
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,310
Wax-Wax Arts! Harpoon!

131
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,510
Exploding Star!

132
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,010
That was rather bland.
You don't use very good gunpowder.

133
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,040
He ate the Exploding Star!

134
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,790
This is bad. It really is fast.

135
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,520
--Good thing I posed beforehand.
--You idiot!

136
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,760
Luffy-san! Please, hurry!

137
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,860
Alright! That pumpkin's
the bad thing, right?!

138
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,700
Hang on! Gum-Gum...

139
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,500
It's no use!

140
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,270
Candle Wall!

141
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,410
...Bazooka!

142
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,140
Hey, you! Don't get in my way!

143
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,710
That would be my line.

144
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,080
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
interfere with my creative activities.

145
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,550
Candle Lock!

146
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,220
I got a mallet!

147
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,330
Gum-Gum...

148
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,800
Oh no! Candle Wall!

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,130
...Mallet!

150
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,120
Hurray! Hurray!

151
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,390
--Mr. 3...
--Impossible!

152
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,290
Luffy! Hurry and break this
set while there's still time!

153
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,470
--No.
--Quit joking around and hurry!

154
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,870
No.

155
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,040
This is no time to be acting stupid!

156
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,300
Luffy-san! Please!

157
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,380
What should I do?

158
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,180
I don't feel like saving you guys.

159
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,660
What are you saying?

160
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
Colors Trap.

161
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Hey! Luffy!

162
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,900
There's no time! Do something
about this thing already!

163
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah... I know.

164
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,770
--Then hurry!
--Yeah, Luffy!

165
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,410
I know, but...

166
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,080
But I don't feel like saving you...

167
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,180
Why do you keep saying that?!

168
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,120
We're the ones who're
about to be wax figures!

169
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,390
Understand?! We're about to die!

170
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,760
Yeah. But for some reason,
I just can't get motivated.

171
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,690
This isn't a motivation problem!

172
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,770
D-Dammit! What's happened to him?!

173
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,470
Our friends're gonna die
if he doesn't hurry!

174
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,010
I'll bring him back to his senses!

175
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,340
Let's go, Karoo!

176
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,580
W-When did you...?!

177
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,450
Give it up. He's already
fallen into a trap.

178
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,760
That's right. See where he's standing?

179
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,260
Where he's standing?

180
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,100
Let's see here...

181
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,800
What's that?
There's a strange black pattern...

182
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,570
What's so important about that?!

183
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,110
You're right. It's nothing.
It's just paint.

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,510
Paint?

185
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:39,520
In other words,
both you and them are goners!

186
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,040
Karoo! Let's just run for now!

187
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,810
He's planning to escape on the bird!

188
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,140
Let's get 'em.

189
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Sprint at full speed!

190
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Hey, you! Wait!
I haven't gotten on yet! Karoo!

191
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,500
Hey! Alright! Stop! Let me get on!

192
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,610
What's the point in being scared of me?!

193
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,750
Miss Golden Week!

194
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,680
This is your doing!

195
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,090
Colors Trap: Betrayal Black.

196
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,130
Touch the black paint,

197
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,030
and you'll want to betray your friends,
no matter what they say.

198
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,470
What does she mean?!
What happened?! Explain!

199
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,940
She's a "realist painter" who can
even create real colors of emotion!

200
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,010
Eh?!

201
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,810
Her refined sense of color
can manipulate people's minds

202
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,780
through the use of her paints.

203
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,120
Manipulate?! That's not good!

204
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,860
That simpleminded idiot is
already easy enough to manipulate!

205
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,230
Then doesn't he just need
to get away from that paint?

206
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,500
Luffy! Get away from there!

207
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,560
No, don't!

208
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,400
Luffy-san! Whatever you do,
do not move from that black circle!

209
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,070
I'm begging you!

210
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,370
Vivi! Why?!

211
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,840
We don't want you to save us at all!

212
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,250
No.

213
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,850
I get it.

214
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,290
You made him do the exact
opposite of what you said...

215
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,790
Huh?

216
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,200
I-I was kind of weird just now!

217
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,260
Luffy-san! Hurry!

218
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,200
Alright! I'll save you right now!

219
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,680
But never mind you guys!
I just wanna laugh!

220
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,250
--Why?!
--Why, you...!

221
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,720
Now what?!

222
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Colors Trap: Laughter Yellow.

223
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,100
You know you're not supposed to move.

224
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Now it's on his clothes!

225
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,500
Luffy! Hurry and take off that clothing!

226
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,770
N-Never mind that!

227
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,310
I just feel like laughing!

228
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,080
Not good!

229
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,350
If it keeps raining down at this pace,
we won't last one more minute!

230
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,800
Did you guys come here to play?!

231
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,270
Look! When Usopp ran into him,
the paint on his back smudged!

232
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,240
Did I wind up doing something again?

233
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,420
Hey, you! Knock it off, you jerk!

234
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,490
Was Laughter Yellow funny?

235
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,290
Shut up! Are you stupid?! Stupid!

236
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,630
Anyways, I gotta break that pumpkin!

237
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,700
Gum-Gum...

238
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,930
Colors Trap: Bullfight Red.

239
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,900
...Bazooka!

240
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,700
Where are you aiming?!

241
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,240
You're not allowed to break it!
You'll make Mr. 3 angry!

242
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,910
What is this?!

243
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,510
Just as bulls rush at red capes,

244
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,420
you feel the urge to attack
that Bullfight Red mark.

245
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,750
Too bad.

246
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,420
I can't stand you anymore!
Get out of here!

247
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,430
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

248
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,930
Having fun?

249
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,600
It's no good.

250
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,100
This isn't his kind of fight.

251
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,570
All his power is useless!

252
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,670
Now to finish it with this!

253
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,070
I'll mix the Laughter Yellow on
your back with Sadness Blue...

254
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,710
Colors Trap: Tranquil Green!

255
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,220
Such nice tea...

256
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,890
You idiot!

257
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,290
So... What happens now?

258
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,690
See? I told you you should've posed!

259
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,430
Too bad for you!

260
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,900
How can you still be so calm about this?!

261
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Damn, they run away fast!

262
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,820
Nose Fancy Double Cannon!

263
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,760
You missed! Way to go, Karoo!

264
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,240
My turn! Special Attack: Lead Star!

265
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,640
We gotta go back to Luffy
and the others again!

266
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,010
We're getting nowhere,
chasing them all around.

267
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,320
Yeah.

268
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,690
I didn't want to use it
on such small fries,

269
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,630
but there's no dodging this.

270
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,700
A .44-caliber,
six-shot flintlock revolver.

271
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,970
A new South Blue model.

272
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,870
It can fire continuously,

273
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,710
and if I use it, the bullets are invisible.

274
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,050
Luffy's acting that way because of
that paint the bad guys mentioned!

275
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,050
They're related somehow!

276
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,390
There was also some on his back
when I crashed into him earlier!

277
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,820
No doubt about it!

278
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,360
If I can just do something
about the paint...!

279
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,760
Hurry!

280
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,010
Ahh. Such nice tea...

281
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Such nice...

282
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,860
Luffy! What are you doing?!

283
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,430
Such... nice... tea...

284
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,930
What are you doing, you idiot?!

285
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,240
The world is awfully big

286
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
so even if there is treasure somewhere,

287
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,950
the odds are astronomical

288
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,190
So relying on dumb luck
won't get you anywhere

289
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,420
So even...

290
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,630
...if someone stops me or
laughs at me from the shadows

291
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,840
the ship will continue forward

292
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,940
Bon voyage!

293
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget about them!

294
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,950
I know I'm a fool, but I gotta go

295
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,620
The crazier the dream,
the cooler the ambition

296
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,290
I know I'm a fool, but I'm gonna fight

297
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,300
The farther the sea,
the more heavenly it surely is

298
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,570
Do everything you can, and you'll
get a little nearer to any horizon

299
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,320
Luffy! They've only just hardened!
There's still time to save them!

300
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,720
--Really?!
--We're gonna save you now, guys!

301
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,450
I'm counting on you, Karoo! Run around!

302
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,390
I refuse to let anyone else die!

303
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,590
--It'll be hot, but endure it!
--Wake up, everyone!

304
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,730
It's damn strange.
Why hasn't anyone come back?

305
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

306
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,270
"Time to Fight Back!
Usopp's Quick Thinking and Fire Star!"

307
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
