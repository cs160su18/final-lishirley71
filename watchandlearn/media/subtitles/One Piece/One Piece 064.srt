Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,060
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,960
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,470
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,230
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,400
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,150
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,010
"A Town That Welcomes Pirates?
Setting Foot On Whisky Peak"

22
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,480
What in the world is with this snow?

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,040
It was warm just a little while ago.

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,180
All right! Done!

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,940
This is the man that fell
from the sky, Mr. Snow Barrel!

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,330
That's such a crude snowman...

27
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,980
What?!

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,190
Look at my soulful artwork,
the Snow Queen!

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Whoa! That's incredible!

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,150
Okay then! Snow Barrel Punch!

31
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,750
What the hell are you doing?!

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,950
Ahh! Mr. Snow Barrel!

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,260
How dare you...?!

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,080
Damn you! Damn you!
Damn you! Damn you!

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,160
How is this?!

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,380
You bastard! Hold it, Luffy!

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,180
How come they're so energetic
when it's this cold?

38
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,480
Nami-san! How much snow shoveling
of love would you like me to do?!

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,100
Please continue until
it stops snowing, Sanji-kun!

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,810
Yaay! Nami-san!

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,150
Hey, you. Doesn't this ship have a heater?

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,650
I'm cold.

43
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,120
Shut up! You guys aren't guests!
Go help shovel snow or something!

44
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,910
Lightning?!

45
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,870
What on earth is going on
with the weather around here?!

46
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,310
It was sunny up until recently.

47
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,460
The next moment, it started snowing,
and now lightning...

48
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,360
The seasons, as well as the weather,
go around randomly.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,300
It's just like what Crocus-san said.

50
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,300
That's how it is in the Grand Line.

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,810
It seems that you guys're
clueless about the Grand Line.

52
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,650
You haven't been steering for
a while now. Is that really okay?

53
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,230
I just checked the direction.

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,070
Ahhhh!

55
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,970
Wh... What?

56
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,060
What's the matter?

57
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,910
What's wrong, Nami-san?!

58
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,200
Ahhh... No way!

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,290
Turn the ship around 180 degrees! Hurry!

60
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,250
180 degrees?! Why're we going back?!

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,420
Did you forget something?

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,920
The ship has turned around and
is going in the opposite direction!

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,740
When I looked away from
the log pose for a second...!

64
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,050
The waves were calm earlier...

65
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,180
Are you really a navigator?

66
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,880
In this sea, you can't trust the winds,
sky, waves, clouds... anything...

67
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,100
The only thing that doesn't change is
the direction that the log pose points.

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,650
Do you understand that?

69
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,610
Stop bossing me around in those
cozy blankets and go help already!

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,510
Brace the yard!

71
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,920
Receive the wind from the starboard!
Turn the ship 180 degrees to the left!

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,360
--Usopp! Take care of the lateen sail!
--Got it!

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,330
--Sanji-kun! Take the helm!
--Leave it to me, Nami-san!

74
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,100
You guys! I'm counting on you!

75
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,290
She's such a slave driver.

76
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,060
Hey, wait! The wind has changed.

77
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,030
No way!

78
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,330
It's the first spring gale!

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,140
Why?!

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,330
Don't just sleep there while
the snow accumulates on you!

81
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,930
Hey! I saw a dolphin jump
over there! Let's go there.

82
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,440
You keep quiet!

83
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,450
The waves are getting high!

84
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,240
I see an iceberg in the
10 o'clock direction!

85
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,070
Nami-san! It's getting foggy!

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,330
What the hell's with this sea?!

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,910
W-W... We're gonna crash!!

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,310
Hey! Water's leaking
at the bottom of the ship!

89
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,430
We have to patch it right away!

90
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,100
Got it!

91
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,730
The clouds are moving fast!

92
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,820
W-Wind's coming!

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,490
It's strong!

94
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,110
It's coming!

95
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,520
Unfurl the sails!
That wind is too strong!

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,540
If we take it directly, we'll overturn!

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,660
Everyone! Eat this!
Let's gather our strength!

98
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,130
You're eating too much!

99
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,420
Oh, crap! The sail is gonna be torn!

100
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,610
Forget about things up here.
Go fix the bottom of the ship!

101
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,360
There's another part of the
bottom of the ship damaged!

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,520
Dammit!

103
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,750
Ahhh, that felt good.

104
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,510
Hey, no matter how nice the weather is,
you guys shouldn't be so lazy.

105
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,520
We'd better be on the right track.

106
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,190
You...

107
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,110
Hm?

108
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,550
Why're you guys on this ship?

109
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,740
You're slow!

110
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,650
We're heading to their town right now.
It's called Whisky Peak.

111
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,500
You mean we're taking them back?
We don't owe them anything.

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,120
Right, we don't.

113
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,500
Well, not like it matters to me...

114
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,460
Yeah, your faces say that
you're thinking bad thoughts.

115
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,720
What were your names again?

116
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,090
I-I'm Mr. 9.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,420
I'm Miss Wednesday.

118
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,010
Right... Something has been bothering
me ever since I first heard your names...

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,220
I feel like I've heard them
somewhere before, or maybe not...

120
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,280
Well, either way...

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,160
How dare you sleep
comfortably all this time...?

122
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,250
You kept sleeping no matter how
many times we tried to wake you up...

123
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,490
What?!

124
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,580
Don't let your guard down, everyone!
We don't know what else might happen.

125
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,420
I was finally able to realize
the danger of this sea just now.

126
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,340
I was able to understand the
reason why it's called the Grand Line.

127
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,590
There's no doubt about it, since my
navigation skills don't work at all.

128
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,930
How blunt... Are we gonna be okay?

129
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,850
We'll be fine! Things will
still work out for sure.

130
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,960
In fact...

131
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,420
Look! Our first journey is over.

132
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
It's an island!

133
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,540
So this is Whisky Peak...

134
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,540
But it's really a funny looking island.

135
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,820
Those cacti are huge!

136
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,930
Hm?

137
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,960
Well then, we'll be leaving now.

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,230
Thanks for taking us home, honeys.

139
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,890
If we're linked by fate, we'll meet again!

140
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,350
Bye bye, baby!

141
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,380
Huh?

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,320
They're gone...

143
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,640
Who on earth were they?

144
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,750
Who cares? We're landing!

145
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,580
There's a river at the front.
Looks like we can go inland by ship.

146
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,630
I-Isn't it possible that there're
monsters or things like that?

147
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,670
It's definitely possible.
This is the Grand Line.

148
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,670
If we come across monsters,
we can just leave the island.

149
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,720
Hold on a sec.

150
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't forget that we have to stay
on this island for a certain period of time.

151
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,350
Why?

152
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,350
Unless we store the magnetism
of this island in the log pose,

153
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,730
we can't go to the next island.

154
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,850
Since each island requires a different
amount of time to store the log,

155
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,820
some islands require only several
hours while others require days.

156
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,230
Th-Then even if this is a monster island
that we want to escape from right away,

157
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,260
it's possible that we have to stay
here for days until the log is stored?

158
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,660
That's right.

159
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,880
Well, we can think about that
when it happens. Let's go already!

160
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,180
Luffy's right. Let's go.
It's not worth thinking about it.

161
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,890
No matter what happens,
I'll protect Nami-san.

162
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,340
H-Hey, wait. Listen, everyone.
My chronic illness is suddenly...

163
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,320
My "do not go to the island" disease is...

164
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,560
Then we're going in.

165
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,790
--Listen. Make sure you're
prepared to run as well as fight.
--No...

166
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,540
Ah, well... like I said,
my chronic illness is...

167
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,240
Well, I guess you're not listening...

168
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,740
I wonder what'll appear...

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,130
P-Please...

170
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,470
Hey, it's a pirate ship.

171
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,170
Pirates are here!

172
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,420
Huh? Something's moving.

173
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
Humans? Humans are there!

174
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,670
Everyone, be careful.

175
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,380
Ahhh, dammit! Since it's come
to this, I've prepared myself.

176
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,450
Monsters or whatever you are,
come on out!

177
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,780
Welcome to the Grand Line!

178
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,520
Welcome to our town!

179
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,740
To the welcoming town, Whisky Peak!

180
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,310
F... Far from monsters,
we're being welcomed!

181
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,500
What's going on?

182
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,250
Pirates! Welcome to our town!

183
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,560
Hurray for the heroes on the sea!

184
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,840
Whoa! There're lots of cute girls!

185
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,900
Ahh! Look this way! They're handsome!

186
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,390
Maybe pirates are
people's heroes after all.

187
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,560
Heeeey!

188
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,890
Welco...

189
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,160
Ma-ma-ma...

190
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,530
Welcome.

191
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,750
My name is Igarappoi.
I'm the mayor of Whisky Peak.

192
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,340
Okay. I'm Luffy. Nice to meet you.

193
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,590
Pops, you went overboard
on curling your hair.

194
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,660
Whisky Peak is a town that thrives
on making liquor and music.

195
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,050
Hospitality is the pride of our town.

196
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,700
As for our proud liquor,
it's as bountiful as the seawater.

197
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,640
Would you allow us
to throw a party for you

198
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,060
so that we may hear your tales of...

199
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,620
Ma-ma-ma...

200
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,770
...your tales of adventure?

201
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,900
We'll be glad to!

202
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,020
All right!

203
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,570
Three idiots...

204
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,570
Say, by the way,

205
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,030
how long will it take for the log
of this island to be stored?

206
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,890
Log? Forget such boring stuff.

207
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,790
Please just rest after such a long journey.

208
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,050
Now, everyone! Prepare for the party!
Sing to entertain the adventurers!

209
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,160
Party time!!

210
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,130
Then I said with utter coolness,
"Sea Kings, don't you touch my friends."

211
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,800
--Wow...
--Captain Usopp!
--You're so amazing!

212
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,130
Well, regarding the Calm Belt,
even I trembled a bit, though.

213
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,670
--A tremble of excitement, that is.
--Whoa!

214
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,060
--Amazing!
--Cheers to Usopp-san!

215
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,040
Now, please don't hold back, drink up.

216
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,190
No, thank you.
I'd rather not drink alcohol.

217
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,680
Don't worr...

218
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,570
Ma-ma-ma...

219
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,060
Don't worry.

220
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,160
It's a special drink made of prime grapes
that are used to make prime wine.

221
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,510
Its flavor is wine itself,
but it doesn't contain alcohol.

222
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,160
I see...

223
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,330
You're right! This is delicious!

224
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,940
We had a good grape
harvest again this year.

225
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,340
Now, to celebrate the harvest,
we'll have our usual toast competition!

226
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,230
That is, you continue to toast and
the last one standing is the winner.

227
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,540
Please join in on our competition.

228
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,930
No thanks. I can't drink that much.

229
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,600
The prize money for the winner
is 100,000 Berries!

230
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,020
Another cup, please!

231
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,560
Zoro! You participate, too!
You don't have money, do you?

232
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,320
What?!

233
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,650
Cheers!

234
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,770
Whoa! Amazing! He finished his 10th cup!

235
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,320
This is it. I can't drink any more.

236
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,050
This girl's downing her 12th cup!

237
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,170
Take that!

238
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,770
More food!

239
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,230
Whoa! The captain finished
a meal for 20 people!

240
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,790
The cook is down!

241
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,890
Please, I can't go on...

242
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,030
Whoa! This young man is trying
to hit on 20 girls at the same time!

243
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,890
What's with this gang?!

244
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,210
It's really a fu...

245
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,340
Ma-ma-ma...

246
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,840
...a fun night!

247
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,360
I'm glad that you all
seem to be having fun.

248
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,710
Yes, indeed, I'm very glad...

249
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,300
For that reason, we failed
our mission of securing food...

250
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,890
However, we'd like to
report that we succeeded

251
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,270
in leading the gang
to Cactus Island. Baby.

252
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,850
All right! If we submit this, we somehow
should be able to clear our names.

253
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,810
Right. I'll drop it in the
Unluckies Box immediately.

254
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,370
They'll deliver it for us...

255
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,940
...to the boss...

256
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,860
This is it. I quit. I'm gonna sleep.

257
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,810
Whoa! The young man is finally
down after his 13th cup.

258
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,140
What?! You're hopeless, Zoro!

259
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,610
There're only two left.

260
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,800
They're at the 15th cup.
She's competing against the sister.

261
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,350
You should quit soon,
too, for your own sake.

262
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't be silly! I definitely won't
quit until I get the prize money.

263
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,540
Ahhh! Thanks for the food.
I can't eat any more.

264
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,750
Three cooks are also down!

265
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,320
Glad you enjoyed it.

266
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,830
I can't drink any more.

267
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,940
I won!!

268
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,750
Ahh, what fun!

269
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,330
She's finally down.

270
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,630
What a nice town...

271
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,180
This is a paradise.

272
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,230
So they wore themselves out
partying and fell asleep...

273
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,140
Sweet dreams...

274
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,690
...adventurers...

275
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,630
Again tonight the
Cactus Rocks look beautiful,

276
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,290
dancing under the moonlight.

277
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,880
You're such a poet, Igarappoi-- no, Mr. 8.

278
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,480
Oh, it's you guys...

279
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,380
What happened to them?

280
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,170
They've fallen...

281
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,580
...to hell...

282
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,650
Geez... Since they were so stubborn,
I added a little alcohol in their drinks.

283
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,230
Otherwise they might still be
up and having a good time.

284
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,390
But was it really necessary
to put on an elaborate act...

285
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,060
...for just five weak-looking brats?

286
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,370
We should've beat them at the harbor.
This town is already short of food.

287
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,310
Also, we didn't have our hopes up
for the whale meat anyway.

288
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,710
You didn't have to say it like that!
We did try our best!

289
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,680
Calm down. Look at this.
I've checked them out beforehand.

290
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,040
Th-Thirty million Berries?!

291
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,390
Them?!

292
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,480
It's foolish to judge a pirate's ability
based on their looks, Miss Mon...

293
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,640
Ma-ma-ma...

294
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,260
Miss Monday.

295
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,610
S-Sorry.

296
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,750
But we've already settled.

297
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,920
Looks like we can send
a good report to the boss.

298
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,000
Confiscate all the money and other
valuables on the ship immediately.

299
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,810
So what about them?

300
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,710
What do we do?

301
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,170
If we kill them, the bounty drops by 30%.

302
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,880
The Government wants
to hold public executions.

303
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,880
Go! Capture them alive!

304
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,350
Hey... Sorry, but...

305
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,120
...do you mind letting them sleep?

306
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,540
They're all exhausted from
the journey this afternoon.

307
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,180
Mr. 8! Miss Monday!

308
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,570
The guy with the bellyband escaped
from the room when we weren't looking!

309
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,740
He's over there.

310
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,450
You bastard...! I thought
you were completely asleep!

311
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,920
Swordsmen never make the mistake
of letting their guard down that much.

312
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,380
So, let's see if I've got this right.
This is a nest of bounty hunters.

313
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,140
You dupe pirates who are in high spirits
after having just entered the Grand Line.

314
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,280
Looks like there're about
100 bounty hunters here.

315
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,480
I'll fight you all... Baroque Works!

316
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,440
You bastard! How is it that
you know our company's name?!

317
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,580
When I used to be in a similar line of work,
I was recruited by your company once.

318
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,410
Naturally, I rejected it.

319
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,320
Employees don't know each other's
identity and are called by code names.

320
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Of course, the boss' whereabouts and his
identity are also a mystery, even to them.

321
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,130
Baroque Works is a criminal group that
just faithfully carries out their orders.

322
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,960
Humph...! Was it a secret?

323
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,360
This is surprising...

324
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,430
If you know our secrets, then we have
no other choice but to kill you.

325
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,990
Another gravestone...

326
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,940
...will be added to the Cactus Rocks...

327
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,880
Kill him!

328
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,010
H... He disappeared...!

329
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,760
You've got me!

330
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,450
Ah, gentle song

331
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,800
Make it there for us

332
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:31,880
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

333
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:40,740
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

334
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:48,740
If you find the world is full of enemies,

335
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,400
I've got your back

336
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:00,830
Don't lose faith

337
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,700
You've got me!

338
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,410
Ah, my love

339
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,620
I'll hold you in my arms forever

340
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,100
You've got me!

341
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,610
The welcoming town is
a nest of bounty hunters.

342
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,570
Are you sure that you need
to add only one gravestone?

343
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,990
No one's eating that meat?
I wanna eat it.

344
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,530
It's a good chance to try out
the Kitetsu III and Yubashiri

345
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,870
I got in Loguetown.

346
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,930
Ladies, please come closer.

347
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm Captain Usopp!

348
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to go all-out!

349
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,710
On the next episode of One Piece!

350
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,400
"Explosion! The Three-Sword Style!
Zoro vs. Baroque Works!"

351
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
