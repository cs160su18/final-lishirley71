00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,740
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,060
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,960
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,470
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,230
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,990
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,500
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,020
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,370
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,340
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,150
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,940
Laboon isn't an ordinary whale.
He's a whale with a human heart.

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,430
"A Promise Between Men!
Luffy and the Whale Vow to Meet Again"

23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,960
Why does Laboon continue
to hit the Red Line?

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Why does he continue to
howl at Reverse Mountain?

25
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,890
I'll tell you... Laboon's story...

26
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,330
Huh?

27
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,580
One day, while I was on duty
as the lighthouse keeper as usual,

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,600
some good-natured pirates

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,670
came down Reverse Mountain
and entered the Grand Line.

30
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,390
And a small whale came in as well,
as if following them.

31
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,840
That was Laboon.

32
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,940
The Island Whale lives
only in the West Blue,

33
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,550
and it's the world's largest whale.

34
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,640
The pirates had been traveling
with Laboon all that time,

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,230
but they left him in the West Blue since
the Grand Line is extremely dangerous.

36
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,690
Although they thought they did,
he followed them.

37
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,660
Island Whales usually
travel together as a group,

38
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,080
but I suspect Laboon felt that
he was a member of that pirate group.

39
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,680
Since their ship had broken down,
they stayed at the cape for several months.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,260
So we became quite good friends.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,840
Because of that,
on the day of their departure...

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,690
I have a favor to ask, since I trust you.

43
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,100
Could you take care of him for 2-3 years?

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,190
We'll go around the world
and definitely come back here.

45
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,650
Listen up, Laboon.

46
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,590
We'll now go into the Grand Line
and travel around the world.

47
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,990
But you wait for us here.

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,780
It's a dangerous place.

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,570
We can't take you with us.

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,120
Don't worry. Three years
will pass by like a flash.

51
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,540
Don't forget... that we're
buddies even if we're far apart.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,510
Well then, we're setting off now...

53
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,020
Guys! We're setting sail! Hoist the anchor!

54
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,350
Yeah!

55
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,820
Laboon!

56
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,110
Laboon! Wait for us!

57
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,570
We'll come back here for sure...!

58
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,180
For sure!!

59
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,710
That was 50 long years ago...

60
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,960
50 years...!

61
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,340
Laboon has been waiting
for those guys for 50 years?

62
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,420
Is that why he continues to howl
at the wall, hitting himself on it?

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,180
Yeah...

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,550
This is an amazing canal.

65
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm surprised that he's still alive,
having a hole like this inside his body.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,090
Is this also your playful mind?

67
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,890
--A doctor's playful mind.
--Doctor?

68
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,100
I may not look one, but I'm a doctor.

69
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,350
I also ran a clinic on
the cape a long time ago.

70
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,000
It was just for a few years,
but I was also a ship's doctor.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,040
Really?

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,670
Then be our ship's doctor!

73
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,300
Don't be ridiculous.

74
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,590
I no longer have the energy to do
reckless things like you guys do.

75
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,950
A doctor, huh? That's why the inside
of the whale's body is like this...

76
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,590
Then these are from the treatment...

77
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,740
That's right.

78
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,270
When the whale is this big,
it's impossible to treat it from outside.

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,340
I'm gonna open the doors.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,490
There it is!! The real sky!!

81
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,310
Hm? Miss Wednesday, what on earth...

82
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,180
Shhh...

83
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,800
But 50 years....?

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,300
Those pirates sure are
making him wait a long time...

85
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,430
Idiot! This is the Grand Line.

86
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,220
They're dead.

87
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,060
No matter how long he waits,
they won't come back.

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,160
Yeah, it's true that 50 years ago

89
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,700
the Grand Line was an uncharted sea
more terrible and chaotic than it is now.

90
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,820
Why are you talking so hopeless?!

91
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,180
You don't know that for sure yet!

92
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,040
They might come back!

93
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,940
It's a very touching story!

94
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,110
A whale continues to believe
in the promise his friends made...

95
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,740
Right, pops?!

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,770
Yeah... But reality is cruel.

97
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,100
I confirmed it using reliable information.

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,140
They ran away... from the Grand Line.

99
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,790
Can't be... Don't tell me...
they left without him?!

100
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,300
Ran away from the Grand Line...

101
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,650
Does that mean they went
through the Calm Belt alive?

102
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,150
Even if they are alive,

103
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,650
they'll probably never come back here.

104
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,840
Seasons. Weather. Current. Wind direction.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,040
They are all random.

106
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,510
Common sense is useless in the Grand Line.

107
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,250
The terror of the Grand Line
takes over weak minds in an instant.

108
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,000
So having weak minds,
they ran away from this sea

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,760
without keeping their promise
in order to save their asses...

110
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,040
They abandoned this whale?!
When he's been waiting for 50 years...?!

111
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,140
That's cruel!

112
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,940
If you know that,
why haven't you told him?

113
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,070
That whale can understand
what people say, right?

114
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,140
I did tell him... everything.

115
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,070
Laboon! Listen up!

116
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,030
I heard that they left the Grand Line.

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,910
You were certainly friends,

118
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,920
and the promise they made
with you was certainly for real.

119
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,300
But they'll never come back here...

120
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,900
Listen to me, Laboon! They're not gonna...

121
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,640
I understand you don't wanna accept it.

122
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,880
But somehow you have to accept it...

123
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,260
Laboon!

124
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,310
Laboon!

125
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:59,450
It's since then that he started
howling at Reverse Mountain

126
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,050
and that he started slamming
his body against the Red Line...

127
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,040
It's as if he's insisting that

128
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,640
they'll come back from the other
side of that wall any time now...

129
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
What a whale...

130
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,460
When there's no point in waiting...

131
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,720
He refuses my words because if he accepts them,
it means that there is no point in waiting.

132
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,400
He's afraid of that more than anything.

133
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,130
He's from the West Blue.
There's no way of going back there now.

134
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,600
That's why those pirates he came here
with are his only buddies and hope.

135
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,310
But you know, it's true
that he is a poor whale,

136
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,990
but in a way you were
also betrayed, right?

137
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,950
Haven't you done
enough for him already?

138
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,660
Look at the scars on his forehead!

139
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,180
If he continues to hit his head hard
like that, he'll die without doubt.

140
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,410
It's a strange relationship, but
I've been with him for 50 long years.

141
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,380
I can't just stand by
and watch him die now.

142
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,340
Hmph!

143
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,400
Huh?

144
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,020
What's that idiot doing?

145
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,600
When we looked away for a second...

146
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Is he pretending he's mountain
climbing or something?

147
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,990
Gum-Gum...

148
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,020
...Flower Arrangement!

149
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,280
Isn't that a mast?

150
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,320
Yep. It's from our ship.

151
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,110
It's the main mast...
Hey! Don't break the ship!

152
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,080
What the hell are you doing?!

153
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Wha...?! Hey, kid!

154
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't worry. He doesn't
die even when he's crushed!

155
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,310
Ha! Dummy!

156
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,530
What does he think he's doing?!

157
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,740
Luffy! What the hell
are you trying to do?!

158
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,740
It's a draw!

159
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,750
I'm strong, aren't I?

160
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,260
You wanna defeat me, don't you?!

161
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,340
Our fight isn't over yet!
So we have to fight again.

162
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,810
Your buddies're dead,
but I'm your rival forever.

163
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,060
We definitely have to fight again
in order to decide who is stronger.

164
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,820
After going around the Grand Line,
we'll come back to see you again.

165
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,150
When I come back, let's fight again!

166
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,560
Hmmm. This is good.

167
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,500
This is the symbol of
our promise to fight again.

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,850
Until we come back,

169
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,340
don't remove that mark by
hitting your head. Got that?!

170
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,620
All right!

171
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,580
Hm? Where're those guys?

172
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,000
Those guys? Oh, those two weird people?

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,750
Maybe they ran away?
I wonder who they were after all...

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Miss Wednesday. What do we do now?

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,970
Hmmm.

176
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,080
In any case, we have to go back once
and at least report to the boss...

177
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,720
Our estimated mission
completion time has long passed.

178
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,690
Right. That's not good.
They'll make us out to be traitors.

179
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,470
Yes. Since we don't have
our weapons any more,

180
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,190
we'll go back to our
office and start over.

181
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,360
It can't be helped.
Well then, we... will...

182
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,660
Hm? Well...? What?!

183
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,990
What's the matter?

184
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,870
--It's gone...
--What?

185
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,080
Huh?

186
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,540
Hmmm? What the heck is this?

187
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,330
You dropped the log pose?!

188
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,110
I'm really sorry, Miss Wednesday!

189
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,300
We can't even go back
to our town without it.

190
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,500
As it stands...

191
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,250
Ah!

192
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,310
C... Could that be...?!

193
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,050
What?!

194
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,890
That's...

195
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,770
O-Oh, no...

196
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,480
--The Unluckies!!
--Darn it! Is it too late now, then?!

197
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,230
--Mr. 13!
--Miss Friday!

198
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,860
Please wait! We can explain!

199
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,140
We'll report to the boss immediately!

200
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,090
Okay then! I'm finally drawing up the
plans for the Grand Line journey now.

201
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,770
All right! I'm finally cooking
the Elephant Bluefin Tuna!

202
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,690
Damn...! How dare Luffy
break the ship?! Geez...

203
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,320
Hey, Zoro! Help me out here!
I'm not a shipwright!

204
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,820
What's going on? Quiet down.

205
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,830
What's the matter, Nami-san?!

206
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,150
If it's food you're
worried about, it's ready!

207
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,090
Oh? Meal time?

208
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,120
Th-The compass is broken!

209
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,330
It doesn't point in any direction...!

210
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,110
Ahh, you're right.

211
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,300
It's spinning.

212
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,800
Whoa! That's cool!

213
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,650
Looks like you guys came
here with no knowledge.

214
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,640
For heaven's sake!
Did you come here to die?

215
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,580
--What?
--Meal?

216
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,320
Feed, in your case!

217
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,750
I thought I told you...

218
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,250
...that common sense
is useless in this sea.

219
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,530
It's not that that compass is broken.

220
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,490
Hm? Then, could it be that
the magnetic fields are...

221
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,990
That's right. The islands in the Grand Line
contain lots of magnetic minerals.

222
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,800
Because of that, they are causing
abnormality throughout the Grand Line.

223
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,160
Furthermore, the current and
the winds don't have constancy.

224
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,960
If you're a navigator, you
should know how scary that is.

225
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,170
It's true that if we don't have a way
of knowing our direction, it's hopeless.

226
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,130
Yummy!

227
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,430
I-I didn't know! Oh, well...

228
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,890
Hey! That's bad! Are we gonna be okay?!

229
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,350
This isn't bad. It's yummy!

230
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,310
Hey, you guys! Please just be quiet!

231
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,940
The nose of the Elephant
Bluefin Tuna tastes good!

232
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,970
You need a log pose to
travel around the Grand Line.

233
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,370
Log pose? I've never heard of it.

234
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,310
It's a special compass
that can record magnetism.

235
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,860
Is it a strange-looking compass?

236
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah, its shape is unusual.

237
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,890
Is it something like this?

238
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,920
Yeah, that's it.

239
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,440
Without the log pose,

240
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,210
it's impossible to travel in the Grand Line.

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,270
I see... But hold on a sec.

242
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,180
--Luffy?
--Hm?

243
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,430
How come you have one?!

244
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,040
This is something that those
two weirdoes dropped on the ship.

245
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,210
They did?

246
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,620
Why did you hit me?

247
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,630
Just going with the flow.

248
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,410
Oh, the flow, huh?

249
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,810
So this is the log pose.
There's no dial face.

250
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:42,250
It's known that the magnetism of islands
in the Grand Line follow a certain rule.

251
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,340
That is, by recording the magnetism
of two islands pulling against each other,

252
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,830
you can find the route to the next island.

253
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,610
Since you can't even figure out
its location in this sea,

254
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,300
the magnetism record of the log pose
is the only thing you can depend on.

255
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:04,510
At first, you can pick one out of the seven
magnetisms produced by Reverse Mountain.

256
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,420
But no matter which island you start with,

257
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,370
those magnetisms will eventually pull against
each other and link themselves to one route.

258
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,790
And the name of the island
at the end of the route is... Raftel.

259
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,450
It's the last point on the Grand Line.

260
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,770
The only one in history who confirmed
that island is the King of the Pirates.

261
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,790
It's a legendary island.

262
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,280
Raftel...

263
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
Then, the One Piece is there?!

264
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,040
Who knows? That's the
most prominent theory,

265
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,760
but no one has been able to reach there.

266
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,930
We'll know once we get there.

267
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,560
Now that I'm done eating,
shall we get ready?

268
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,490
Did you eat this all by yourself?!

269
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,020
Whoa! Even the bones're gone.

270
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,370
Log pose, huh? We have
to take good care of this.

271
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,480
This is the key to our journey.

272
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,270
You damn rubber man!

273
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,900
I wanted Nami-san...
I wanted Nami-san to...

274
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,660
...eat more!!

275
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,800
Ouch! What're you doing?

276
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,120
--That'll show you, you damn rubber man.
--Sanji-kun...

277
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,550
Yes, Nami-san!

278
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,670
Both of you, go cool your heads off!!

279
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,850
Hey, hold on a sec...

280
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,820
Wasn't that something really important?!

281
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,410
Our precious log pose was...

282
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,490
Don't panic. I'll give you mine.

283
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,400
I wanna thank you guys for Laboon, too.

284
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,920
Ahhh... I thought I'd die. Hm?

285
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,680
Here, take my hand, honey.

286
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,920
--Oh, thank you.
--Nice day, isn't it?

287
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
Hey!

288
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,640
We have a favor to ask.

289
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,120
Whisky Peak? That's a weird name.

290
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,240
What's that?

291
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,000
That's where we live... uhm, sir.

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,140
What happened to your own ship?

293
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,520
It's busted.

294
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,280
Isn't that asking too much, Mr. 9,
after trying to kill the whale?

295
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,620
So what are you guys?

296
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,320
I'm a king.

297
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,600
Liar.

298
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,330
We can't say!

299
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,800
But we want to go back to the town.

300
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,000
We don't want to be
secretive, either, but...

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,570
The motto of our company
is "mystery," after all...

302
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,760
We just can't tell you anything about us.

303
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,620
Placing confidence in your character,
we're begging you.

304
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,810
We will definitely return the favor.

305
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,770
Don't do it.

306
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,810
No matter what they say,
they're dishonest people.

307
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,380
By the way, we don't have a
log pose because we broke it.

308
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,770
Do you still wanna ride with us?

309
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,040
What?! You broke it?!
That's mine, you know!

310
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,670
How dare you act stuck up
just because we're being humble?!

311
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,860
You guys can't go anywhere, either!

312
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,740
Oh, but actually, we have
one that Crocus-san gave us.

313
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,830
We beg you people of such character...

314
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,790
Dammit! This bitch tricked us!

315
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,670
You can ride with us.

316
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,030
What?!

317
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,740
Did you say Whisky Peak? Let's go there.

318
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,560
What?

319
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,220
Hey, are you serious?

320
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,640
We're troubling ourselves
to take these shadowy people?

321
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,160
What's the problem?
Don't worry about small things.

322
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,040
But you can only choose the
route here, the starting point.

323
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,860
If we don't like it, then we
can go around one more time.

324
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,860
I see...

325
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,170
Now, shall we get going?

326
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,610
Now I've made a promise with the whale.
Let's get ready to set sail.

327
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,450
Who on earth are you?

328
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,180
Me? I'm...

329
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,870
...the man who'll be King of the Pirates.

330
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,880
What a stupid pirate...

331
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,380
It should be okay by now.
The log must've been stored.

332
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,420
Is it pointing at the
same direction as the map?

333
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,850
Yep. It's pointing at Whisky Peak.

334
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,770
See ya, flower pops!
Thanks for the log pose!

335
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah. Have a safe trip!

336
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,320
See ya, whale! I'm leaving now!

337
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
To Whisky Peak...

338
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,620
...full speed ahead!!

339
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,630
Yeah!!

340
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,100
I wonder if they're the pirates that
we've been waiting for all this time...

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,600
That man has such
an uncanny air about him...

342
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,030
Don't you think, Roger?

343
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,950
My overflowing feelings don't connect

344
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,790
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

345
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,710
I'll set off by myself,

346
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,380
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

347
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,440
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

348
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,520
Why is it so hot?

349
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:55,830
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

350
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,830
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

351
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,630
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

352
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,340
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

353
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,990
With you, I can run there

354
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,980
Whoa!! What a feast!

355
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,820
Receiving this kind of treatment
as soon as we arrive?

356
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,360
I'm glad I'm a pirate!

357
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,020
Hey, don't you guys think it's weird?

358
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,260
There're many cute girls, too!

359
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,680
The entire town is welcoming us...
What do you think, Nami?

360
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,330
When it comes to a drinking game,
I won't lose! Bring it on!

361
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,700
You too?!

362
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

363
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,460
"A Town That Welcomes Pirates?
Setting Foot on Whisky Peak"

364
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
