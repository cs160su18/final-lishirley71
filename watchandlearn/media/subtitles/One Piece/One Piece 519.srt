Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

WE GO!

68
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,460
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

69
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,350
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

70
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,140
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago

71
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,740
to go on to the next stage - the New World.

72

"The Navy Has Set Out! The
Straw Hats in Danger!"

73
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,540
Sunny!

74
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,190
Sorry to keep you waiting for 2 years.

75
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm glad that you're fine!

76
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,310
What an attractive woman before me!

77
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,780
You're our super archaeologist -

78
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,050
Robin, aren't you?!

79
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,190
You haven't changed, Franky!

80
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,430
I've changed, silly!

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,610
Look at my body - it's full
of romantic masculinity!

82
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,780
Look upon this fantastic transformation
such as no one has ever seen before!

83
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm beyond human understanding now!

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,750
Yeah, it's probably hard to
see you as a mere human now.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,180
Hey, hey, you mean I'm a pervert?

86
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,490
You're good at praising people!

87
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,440
This is the coating?

88
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,980
It's like jelly.

89
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,810
That's right! Rayleigh is really skilled!

90
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,610
Now we can go into the depths of the sea!

91
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,970
What a technique!

92
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,010
I just saw Rayleigh and the others.

93
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,080
So you went to the bar.

94
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,660
What number were you?

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,970
8th.

96
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,170
Everybody's here except for Luffy.

97
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,510
I see. We'll begin a new journey soon.

98
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,630
I've got the ship in top condition.

99
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,510
A new weapon is ready, too!

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,710
I can't wait.

101
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,840
By the way, where are the others?

102
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,230
I saw Usopp and Sanji here
then Usopp went to get fuel

103
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,810
and Sanji went food shopping.

104
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,660
I see. Actually, on my way here,

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,700
I found this.

106
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,180
Did you know about this? What is Soul King?

107
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,540
Oh, about Brook.

108
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah, I knew about it.
I saw his TD everywhere.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,670
He's quite a shining star now.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,880
From the dark, silent, foggy sea,

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,010
he made it to the footlights,
where people cheer for him.

112
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,810
He might not...

113
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,700
...come back to do pirating again.

114
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,820
GROVE #33 SABAODY DOME

115
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,830
...King is mysterious

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,630
He's nothing but bones!

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,330
Afro on the skull! Girls love the contrast

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,680
If you wanna make out with her

119
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,640
Got milk! Got milk!

120
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,370
You need calcium more than protein

121
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,580
Captain!

122
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,200
Captain Luffy!

123
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,450
Damn!

124
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,870
Luffy!

125
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,330
I missed you guys!

126
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,540
Hey!

127
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,920
Luffy!

128
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,450
Franky!

129
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,340
Nami!

130
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,640
Sogeking?!

131
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
Cool!

132
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,810
You guys have changed in these 2 years!

133
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,700
I bet you got stronger!

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,140
Hmmm...

135
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,300
It's the Straw Hats.

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,900
What are they doing on the street?

137
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,360
What just happened was...

138
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,550
Don't look them in the
eye. You can't fight them.

139
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,380
Dammit!

140
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,490
What happened to you?

141
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,820
I don't know!

142
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,670
I felt chills all over my body!

143
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,710
What kind of trick did he use?

144
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,920
Oh yeah! We have another problem.

145
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,720
The thing is Cocoa got...

146
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,490
No, I mean... Nico Robin got...

147
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,270
What did you say, Zoro?!

148
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,670
Nico Robin has been abducted?!

149
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,850
I'm sorry. It happened in front of our eyes.

150
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,730
Yeah, that's right! This is serious, Luffy!

151
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,240
She could be kidnapped like Camie!

152
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Who did it?

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,150
I have no idea.

154
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,290
Captain.

155
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,910
I think people who have a
problem with the real Robin

156
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,000
have taken Cocoa by mistake.

157
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,920
That's possible.

158
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,300
She really looks like the real
Robin but that worked against us.

159
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,050
Hey, stop talking in whispers!

160
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,760
Oh well, let's leave it at that.

161
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,500
That's her fate.

162
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,190
--What?!
--What?! Okay, Captain.

163
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,280
Hey, Luffy! Robin has been abducted!

164
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,770
I've been thinking, what is this creature?

165
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,310
Is that a joke?!

166
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,050
Don't say that even if it's joke!

167
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,700
How can he speak? Is he a stuffed animal?

168
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,510
Take it back, Luffy!

169
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,540
Shut up!

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,340
More importantly, assemble the 100
members that we recruited here

171
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,850
on this island at Grove #46!

172
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,390
That man who has a long nose.

173
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,350
That woman with long orange hair.

174
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,590
That brat with a cape and a huge backpack...

175
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,690
Find those three

176
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,850
and make them regret that they
messed with Straw Hat Luffy!

177
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,490
--Roger!
--Roger!

178
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,230
We must try not to kill them
before we bring them here.

179
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,330
This is a good opportunity to
show them how formidable we are!

180
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,660
Okay, let's go!

181
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,080
Wait a minute, you guys!

182
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,050
The last 2 years changed your personalities?

183
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,430
Luffy!

184
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,380
I... I... feel sad...

185
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,250
and can't help crying!

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Again, what is this creature?

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
What about Robin?

188
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
Why don't you guys say something?!

189
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,430
Huh? How can he talk?

190
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,860
Toys today are pretty well-made!

191
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,900
Dammit! I'm disappointed in you guys!

192
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,620
I'm gonna go help her alone!

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,610
Wait for me, Robin!

194
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,830
What happened?

195
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
They had a fight among themselves?

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,960
That's...

197
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,710
There's no doubt!

198
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,330
Straw Hat Luffy and other

199
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,280
members may look radically
different from 2 years ago

200
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,800
but no one else has a weird pet like that!

201
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,560
They're...

202
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,730
...the Straw Hats! They're alive!

203
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,550
This is Grove #47. We identified
the pirate group - the Straw Hats!

204
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,200
It seems like the pirates
that Straw Hat recruited...

205
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,250
URGENT CREW NEEDED

206
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,250
...on this island are
assembling at the Grove #46!

207
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,080
Understood! Roger that!

208
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,930
Go now and help the locals evacuate!

209
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,560
Roger that!

210
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Pirates are gathering at Grove #46!

211
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,960
The target is the Straw Hats!

212
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,640
We'll make a raid on the lawless area!

213
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,430
Get ready for action!

214
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,230
Close in on them from Grove #40, 42, 44!

215
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,560
Backup from G1 will come soon!

216
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,150
S-Sentomaru-san!

217
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm gonna go first!

218
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,580
I'll take PX-5 and PX-7 with me!

219
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,500
Oh, you're deploying Pacifistas?!

220
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,310
Of course!

221
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
You are all underestimating the Straw Hats!

222
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,950
It's been 2 years since the war now.

223
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,340
They must have gotten stronger!

224
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,680
They're different from any of the other
rookies who have come to this island!

225
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,340
What was behind

226
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,360
the Kuma-kou's doing from 2
years ago is still a mystery...

227
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,430
But when I examined his eccentric behavior
carefully after he lost his personality,

228
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,860
I was able to deduce that the
Straw Hats would reunite one day!

229
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,040
Let's go!

230
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,740
Oh, it's reacting! So I think it's this way.

231
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,550
You got hurt because you messed with me.

232
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,550
Damn!

233
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,090
Run!

234
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,480
There are too many pirates...

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,780
Hmmm, maybe I should put it on.

236
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,410
I said, give me a better discount.

237
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,620
N-No way, ma'am!

238
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,470
You're asking me to sell these
many clothes for half price?

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,380
That's a bit...

240
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,250
Hey, Nami.

241
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,810
You can buy clothes at the Fish-Man Island!

242
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,210
We need to buy fuel...

243
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,560
No!

244
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,970
Here! I'll buy these too
so discount them by 90%!

245
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,950
No!!

246
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,360
Hey, hey, you got better at
bargaining after 2 years.

247
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,240
Hey, Moss Head!

248
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,570
You gotta stay with me!

249
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,370
I don't want you getting lost.

250
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,500
Huh? Who do you think you're
talking to, Mustache Eyebrow?

251
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,100
What did you just say?

252
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,380
Oh! Something smells good...

253
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,890
Oh, it looks good!

254
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,980
Hi!

255
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,640
Try some!

256
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,890
Oh, how dazzling! There's
a woman within my reach!

257
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,900
Oh? That bastard! Where did he go?!

258
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I need a fishing pole to fish.

259
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,100
Oh, a fishing store.

260
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
He's not here... That bastard!

261
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,560
Robin!

262
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Where did they take her?!

263
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,350
Damn! Damn! Damn!

264
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,090
Damn!

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,970
What happened to everybody?!

266
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Franky...

267
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,980
They used to be so compassionate!

268
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,400
Robin is abducted and he
says "leave it at that"?

269
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,960
How awful is that?!

270
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,830
What have I been working
for for the last 2 years?

271
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,960
For whom?!

272
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,970
Hey, Chopper!

273
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,710
Hey!

274
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,050
Here, here!

275
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,470
I knew it was Chopper!

276
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,340
Usopp!

277
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,180
Oh man, you got so big!

278
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,770
You must be comfortable to ride!

279
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,110
Doing okay?

280
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,080
Uh-huh!

281
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,190
He's right! You're much softer than before!

282
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,620
It's been a long time, Chopper!

283
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,490
Oh?

284
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,820
Nami?

285
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,790
Yes.

286
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,540
Oh yeah!

287
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm glad to see you guys but
this is no time for that!

288
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,420
Robin is in trouble!

289
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,770
Huh? You mean they're imposters?

290
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,120
That's why there are 2 Namis?

291
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,480
Oh please!

292
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,030
Robin's escaped the Government for 20 years!

293
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,830
It unthinkable to me that
she could be put into a bag

294
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,200
and taken so easily!

295
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,940
I got it!

296
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,990
I thought there was something wrong...

297
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,540
She didn't even smell familiar!

298
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,860
Now, I'm starting to get mad!

299
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,210
What's wrong with them? Posing like us?!

300
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,310
I won't allow them to imitate us!

301
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,720
As if we're...

302
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,370
...stars, those bastards!

303
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,010
Don't let it go to your head!

304
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,690
Well, it can't be helped if we have
imitators since our captain became famous.

305
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,950
I have to think about how
to sign my autograph.

306
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,950
I have one already!

307
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,610
We're famous in a bad way! Don't you get it?

308
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,050
Hey, Chopper!

309
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,630
Chopper!

310
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,950
Honestly! We got the real Straw Hats'
pet by luck and now we lost him...

311
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,930
Ouch! My side!

312
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,640
What did you say?!

313
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,350
That strange creature is a
survivor of the real Straw Hats?!

314
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,620
Why didn't you say so?

315
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,370
Bring him here again!

316
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,150
--What?!
--What?!

317
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,680
That's impossible! We don't
know where to look for him!

318
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,890
We lost him completely!
Sabaody Archipelago is big!

319
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,780
Ouch! My side! It hurts!

320
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,510
We can't run anymore! Let'
walk! Let's just walk!

321
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,210
Hancock was right. I need this mustache.

322
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,550
I shouldn't cause trouble.

323
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,760
Look!

324
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,110
Is that the brat with a cape and

325
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,840
a huge backpack that
Captain was talking about?

326
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,670
Is it some brat?

327
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,390
Looks like a happy old man.

328
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,770
Oh, you guys!

329
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,360
Hey, friend, we need you to come with us.

330
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,490
If you just come quietly,
we won't have any trouble.

331
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,450
Our captain is very angry.
Give up on living a long life.

332
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,290
What? Are you too scared to even talk?

333
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,280
So you're Sanji, aren't you?

334
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,150
And you must be Zoro! Long time no see!

335
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,090
H-Hey, it's been a while! Hasn't it?

336
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,700
Yeah! Let's go now!

337
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,470
Oh, everybody's here already?

338
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,500
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

339
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,140
Do you think he's mistaking us?

340
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,790
Who cares!

341
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,020
We just have to take him to Captain!

342
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,530
I wanna go to sea. I wanna fish.

343
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,410
No, you can't, shithead!

344
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,660
Why can't I?!

345
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,410
And why should I listen to you?!

346
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,100
Do you think I'm walking
with you because I want to?!

347
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,610
You'll cause me more trouble if you
wander about this island again!

348
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,010
You Stray Moss!

349
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,130
Everybody's coming soon so
just walk to the ship with me!

350
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,080
Dammit!

351
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,600
How could No. 7 talk bossily to No. 1?

352
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,380
Why are you ranking us in
the order of our arrival?!

353
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,670
You got here first by chance!
Don't get carried away!

354
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,740
Okay, I'm sorry... No. 7.

355
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
Alright, I'll fight you!

356
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,040
I trained my legs in hell for 2 years!

357
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,000
Bring it on! I'll cut you in half!

358
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,560

359
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,070

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,620

361
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,950

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,850

The Straw hats slowly gather on the Sunny,

378
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,760
but, attracted by the actions
of the Fake Straw Hats,

379
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,020
the Marines raid Brook's live performance.

380
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,410
Amongst the confusion, Brook starts

381
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,890
to sing his last song as the Soul King.

382
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

383
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,730
"Big Guns Assembled! The Danger
of the Fake Straw Hats!"

384
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,690
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
