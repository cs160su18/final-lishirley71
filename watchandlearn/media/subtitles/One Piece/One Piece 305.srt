00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,920
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,720
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,210
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,380
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,460
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,100
I won't take my focus off of you.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,070
No matter what they're going through
right now, they'll survive for sure!

36
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,530
But if I let you get away now,
you'll go kill my friends!

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,910
I won't take my focus off of you!

38
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,080
Can you really defeat me?!

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,040
I can't protect anyone unless I win!

40
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,010
Gum-Gum...

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,340
...Rifle!

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,670
Iron Body. Empty Tree.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,680
I thought I was able to meet a man
with some backbone. How disappointing.

44
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,830
Did you run out of strength from
your doping earlier after all?

45
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,030
If it's backbone you want, I'll show you...

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,070
...another tactic!

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Third... Gear!

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,420
Bone Balloon!

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,840
Bone?

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,470
The power that moves
from one bone to another...

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,050
Take a look! My left arm is...

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
...the arm of a giant!

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,730
If it's all show, don't even bother!

54
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,190
Gum-Gum...

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,150
Iron Body!

56
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,110
...Giant Pistol!

57
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,240
"Shivering Past! Dark Justice and Rob Lucci"

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,560
I feel like I'm about to pass out.
I can't fall into the sea like this...!

59
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,240
Oops...!

60
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,550
What was that?

61
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,330
Hurry up and help the injured!

62
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,500
Who are you?!

63
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,760
--A beast?!
--No, he's a power holder!

64
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,180
So I landed on the deck of
a battleship. That was close...

65
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,050
He flew from the direction of the bridge.

66
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,080
Is he a pirate?

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,690
I saw a huge hand, too!

68
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,400
Stop! Stop! I said stop!

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,630
It's dangerous ahead of here!
Water is rushing towards us!

70
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,960
C-Can't you guys hear the sound of water?!

71
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,040
Listen, if the water flows into
an underground passage like this,

72
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,080
we'll have no choice but to drown.

73
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,180
Zoro-kun, can't you hear the sound of water?!

74
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,540
Hmm, it's true that
something doesn't feel right.

75
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,500
Then let's stop, you guys!

76
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,210
There's no other passage. We have
no choice but to keep on this path!

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,970
I knew it!

78
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,390
Granny and the others
are being chased by water!

79
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,460
Ah! Pirate guys!

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,850
Guys! Do something about this water!

81
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,690
Do something?! What're we supposed to do?!

82
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,640
See, I told you! This passage is
gonna be flooded with water!

83
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,280
N-Nami-san is...

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,420
...rushing into my arms!

85
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,440
How positive!

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,280
This is bad! We're gonna be shut in here!

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't cut it! So this isn't iron or stone?!

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
This is an undersea passage.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,990
It must be made of some damn thick steel
that can bear the water pressure!

90
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,170
Then there's nowhere to escape!

91
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,630
Ahh! It's here!

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,880
It isn't safe here! We're gonna die!

93
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,450
Hurry!

94
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,460
This is no good! The sea train won't start!

95
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,330
Aren't there any engineers?!

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,480
The attacks will reach here soon! Hurry up!

97
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,020
Vice Admiral!

98
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,790
What do we do about capturing
Nico Robin on the Bridge of Hesitation?!

99
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,450
--Leave her alone.
--But...

100
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,680
As long as that man is on this island

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,730
and is given the mission
of escorting Nico Robin,

102
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,050
we don't have to get involved.

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,510
We'll just burn everything down
except the Bridge of Hesitation.

104
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,560
Yes, sir!

105
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,280
Vice Admiral...

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,290
Could this man you mentioned be...
Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9?

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,940
As we suspected, he's a power holder!

108
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,410
Who the hell are you?!

109
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,410
We're asking who you are! Answer us!

110
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,680
Stop it, you idiots!

111
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,580
Captain?!

112
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,090
Put down your guns!

113
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,250
Who do you think you're talking to?!

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,090
He is... Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9!

115
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,150
R-Rob Lucci-san...

116
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,710
Wha... That...

117
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,800
We're sorry! Please spare our lives!

118
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,350
Shut your mouths. Your whining hurts my ears.

119
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,050
I've heard a lot about Mr. Rob Lucci,

120
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,660
so he is really that good?

121
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,990
It was fifteen years ago...

122
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,050
In some kingdom,

123
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,830
there was an incident where 500
soldiers got captured by pirates.

124
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,630
"15 years ago"

125
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,300
Guys! Don't hold back! Go wild!

126
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,020
Kill anyone who resists! Show no mercy!

127
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't flinch! Protect this
country from the pirates!

128
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,410
The kingdom put up unrelenting
resistance against the pirates.

129
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,570
However...

130
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,450
Those damn pirates...!

131
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,310
Trench mortars...?!

132
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,480
This is it for you! If you don't wanna die,
just give up and surrender!

133
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,530
If you resist, we'll blow you away
with these trench mortars!

134
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,270
They're all our hostages!

135
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,830
Throw them all in a warehouse!

136
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,840
In exchange for the hostages' lives,
the pirate captain demanded the throne.

137
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,180
Your Majesty. For the sake of the citizens,

138
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,470
you should firmly refuse the
pirates' despicable demand!

139
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,970
He's right!

140
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,970
With the power of the kingdom's
main military and the Imperial Guards,

141
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,770
we don't have to fear those pirates!

142
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,600
Your Majesty!

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,030
But those soldiers who fought risking their lives

144
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,650
and ended up being taken
hostage are also my people.

145
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,680
I can't just sit back and let them die.

146
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,360
But...

147
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,060
Even if this throne is taken away,
it's possible to take it back.

148
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,410
But you can't take back people's lives!

149
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,810
Your Majesty...

150
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,990
But even if we accepted the pirates' demands,

151
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,340
I find it hard to believe that they'd
release the hostages as they promised!

152
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,140
Your Majesty!

153
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,600
Your Majesty! An emissary from the
World Government has just arrived!

154
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,250
Is that right?! From the World Government...

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,070
Show him in immediately.

156
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,690
Yes, your Majesty!

157
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,440
To the kingdom that was about
to surrender with its hands tied

158
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,370
over its concern for the hostages,
the World Government sent a boy.

159
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
A-A child?

160
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,630
Dammit! That blasted World
Government! How insulting!

161
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,350
Where's the prey?

162
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,720
Prey? You mean the pirates?

163
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,860
They're occupying the western
harbor and making it their hideout.

164
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,770
Okay.

165
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,970
Well then, I'd like you to leave the rest to me.

166
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,900
Wait!

167
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,690
Please give the highest priority
to the hostages' lives.

168
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,820
Are you trying to tell the
World Government what to do?

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,700
Wh-Why does this boy make me so intimidated?

170
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,710
The World Government...

171
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,390
Good work, guys!

172
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,300
Eat and drink to your heart's content
and have a good time tonight!

173
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,390
Yahoo!

174
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,660
A kingdom ain't actually a big deal!

175
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,140
No, it ain't!

176
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,420
Now the kingdom will be all ours!

177
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,880
Hooray for the boss!

178
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,490
Idiot! He's the new king!

179
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,620
Oh, that's right!

180
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,150
Booze! We're running out of booze!

181
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,400
Us, too! Someone, bring some more!

182
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,830
Today's booze is especially tasty!

183
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,510
--You guys...
--Huh?

184
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,370
Who's your captain?

185
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,660
Who are you?

186
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,500
In the name of the World Government,
I've come to arrest you all.

187
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,420
Arrest?! Me?! A brat like you will arrest me?

188
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,640
It seems like the Government
is really hard up for people.

189
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Seriously, don't make me laugh!

190
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,580
What can one little brat do?

191
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,270
If you wanna pretend to be some
government big shot, do it somewhere else!

192
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,320
Beat it! We got no time
to play games with a brat.

193
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,070
Beat it already!

194
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,970
Before you get hurt!

195
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,030
You're in my way. Move.

196
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,410
It's you who's gonna move!

197
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,190
Iron Body.

198
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,590
What's with him?!

199
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,640
He used a weird technique!

200
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,560
I see. Not too bad.

201
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,180
It might not be a total lie that
you're from the World Government.

202
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,690
But if you do any more weird stuff,
we can't guarantee the hostages' lives!

203
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,280
So long as you obey us,
we'll keep you alive for a while

204
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,530
as a hostage for the World Government.

205
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,750
Now no one can defeat us!

206
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,110
Throw that brat in the same
lockup where the others are!

207
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,500
Get in there!

208
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,670
We'll have you stay in here, too.

209
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,700
Wh-Who's that boy?

210
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,430
He's a "Great Emissary"
from the World Government.

211
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,460
He said he came to rescue you.

212
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,490
Now the Government will
do whatever we tell them to.

213
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,660
No one can defeat us!

214
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,470
Well, you guys are all hostages.
Try and get along in there!

215
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,110
I'd like to verify one thing.

216
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,670
Hm? What is it?

217
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,260
Are all of the hostages here?

218
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,190
Yeah.

219
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,690
I see.

220
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,500
Shave!

221
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,450
Tempest Kick!

222
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,020
Once the boy infiltrated the
pirates' hideout, right then and there,

223
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,940
he killed all 500 of the kingdom's
soldiers who were taken hostage.

224
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,190
K-Killed all of them?

225
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,360
Can't be...! Is something like that permissible?!

226
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,410
Even if it's the World Government...
Even if it's for justice...

227
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,620
P-Pardon me!

228
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,330
"Justice"

229
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,330
Listen up. Justice isn't all warm and fuzzy!

230
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,810
You guys, too, remember it!

231
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,750
Yes, sir!

232
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,470
Naturally, the pirates got
angry and rained bullets

233
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,260
upon the boy who was standing on the
mountain of bodies with his back turned.

234
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,170
But the boy stood up in the flame of explosions,
killed the boss of the pirates,

235
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,180
and settled that incident all by himself.

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,770
Boss!

237
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,680
Boss! Boss! Boss!...

238
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,770
Pipe down! What's the problem?!

239
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,590
Boss...!

240
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,980
That brat is going on a rampage in the lockup!

241
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,740
What?!

242
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,120
Wh-What the hell is this?!

243
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,960
How dare you... kill our important hostages...?!

244
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,710
They committed a crime.

245
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,170
So I executed them in the name of justice.

246
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,590
A crime?

247
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,260
As soldiers of the kingdom,
being weak is a crime.

248
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,710
They surrendered to evil and
plunged the kingdom into a crisis.

249
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,270
Soldiers like that don't have the right to live.

250
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,650
They deserve to die.

251
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,020
You bastard! And you call yourself
an official of the World Government?!

252
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,320
Justice would never surrender to evil.

253
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,280
Guys! Bring him down!

254
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,460
That serves you right, you damn brat.

255
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,130
Don't treat us like fools!

256
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,540
Dammit! After all the trouble we
went through, our plan got ruined!

257
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,180
H... How could he have survived that?!

258
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,650
Shave!

259
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,110
Finger Pistol.

260
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,420
Boss...

261
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,210
H-He's a monster!

262
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,480
Help!

263
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,810
The boy, who had several
bullet marks on his back,

264
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,140
was a CP9 intelligence agent at the age of 13.

265
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,780
People call him the strongest
and cruelest mass killing machine

266
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,850
in the history of CP9,
whose mission is dark justice.

267
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,450
To think that he was capable of
all that when he was only 13...

268
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,320
That's exactly why all we have
to do is fulfill our own duty.

269
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,030
Gum-Gum...

270
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,010
Rocket!

271
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,040
What is it this time?!

272
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,410
Something came out!

273
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,470
That's Straw Hat Luffy, whose
bounty is 100 million Berries!

274
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,670
I didn't think he'd be that fat.

275
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,980
There you are! Pigeon guy!

276
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,300
Shoot him down!

277
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,430
That won't work! The Bone Balloon is tough!

278
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,230
Gum-Gum... Giant Axe!

279
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,700
Ahhh!

280
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,530
What the hell?! Is it a giant?!

281
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,520
Gum-Gum... Giant Whip!

282
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,590
Whoa! Watch out!

283
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,820
The masts got broken!

284
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,900
They're falling down!

285
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,480
The fight between those two is just crazy!

286
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,330
Finger Pistol...! Pick!

287
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,120
It seems that as your power increases,
your speed decreases.

288
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,840
Tempest Kick... Victory Bird!

289
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,040
The iron outer shell got cracked...!

290
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,520
This ship won't last long!

291
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,780
That was close. I almost got split in two.

292
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,410
Did you see that, Cutty Flam?!

293
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,180
It's all over for you guys! Or rather,
it was all over from the start!

294
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,790
It's a bit early to say that
when the fight isn't over yet!

295
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,420
The one who is fighting Straw Hat is Lucci.

296
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,750
He's the strongest man in the history of CP9!

297
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,150
You might've been able to
get rid of the others okay,

298
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,380
but Lucci's another story entirely!

299
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,680
Once Straw Hat is taken out,
you're next, Cutty Flam!

300
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,930
I'm counting on you, Straw Hat!

301
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,400
What's going on? Give me a report.

302
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,580
Yes, sir, Vice Admiral!

303
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,040
We heard that Straw Hat Luffy and
Mr. Rob Lucci of CP9 are currently fighting.

304
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,030
As a result, the #4 ship got wrecked!

305
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,610
Rob Lucci isn't gonna die.

306
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,090
To the gunners on all ships, aim at the #4 ship!

307
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,870
Fire all cannons together in five seconds!

308
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,410
Wha... Vice Admiral, you must be kidding.

309
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,250
One thousand of our men are onboard!

310
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,180
A moment's indecision can allow
vicious criminals to slip away.

311
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,140
Can you protect our future from them?

312
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,110
Fire!

313
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,340
We were finally able to free Robin-chan,
but if we don't do anything, we'll drown!

314
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,490
I-I can't breathe... I can't hold my breath!

315
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh... Am I dreaming?

316
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,560
How beautiful... you are...!

317
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

318
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,270
"A Mystical Mermaid Appears?
As Consciousness Fades Away..."

319
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
