2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,550
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,040
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,510
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,140
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,850
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:25,230
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,910
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,740
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,940
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,510
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,060
We are!

24
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,420
"The Worst Man in the Eastern Seas!
Fishman Pirate Arlong!"

25
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,840
The weather's so great!

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,610
Is the Grand Line far,
far away that way?!

27
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,020
Or is it maybe this way?!

28
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,220
That way?! This way?!

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,000
This is so exciting!

30
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,490
You're annoying. Sit still, will ya?

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
Sorry! Sorry!

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,020
But we finally have a cook,
so now we just need to get Nami back

33
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,460
and then we're finally
going into the Grand Line!

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,440
Nami-san, huh?

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,890
Just remembering her beautiful
visage makes me happy!

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,680
How I can't wait to see her again!

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,640
Hey, Yosaku. We're almost
to where Nami is, right?

38
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,760
You guys're soft-minded!
Too soft-minded!

39
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
Don't you get it?!

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,540
Minute by minute, we're heading
right for the infamous Arlong!

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,370
Big Sis's eyes were glued to
Arlong's picture when she saw it!

42
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,400
She wasn't her normal self!

43
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,180
Big Sis Nami plans to take down Arlong

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,170
and collect his
20 million-Berry bounty!

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,350
She may already be inside
his compound as we speak!

46
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,750
Well, let's have some food!

47
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,480
Yeah.

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,820
Gahh!

49
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,440
Don't tell me you guys've
never heard of Arlong?!

50
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,490
Arlong? Who's that?

51
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,410
Never heard of him.

52
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,860
Alright, listen up!

53
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,660
I guess I'll just have to
fill you in about everything!

54
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,650
Arlong is a fishman who used to
rampage throughout the Grand Line!

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,990
Fishman?

56
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,620
A fishman, huh? I haven't met one yet.

57
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,660
Say, I hear the mermaids on
Fishman Island in the Grand Line

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,590
are absolutely beautiful!

59
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,120
Are fishmen...

60
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,190
...like this?

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,100
--That's a masterpiece!
--Can't you guys stay focused?!

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,270
Alright, then. I'll explain
from the very beginning.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
The reason the Grand Line's called
a pirate graveyard in the first place

64
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,780
is because of the three
powers that reign over it.

65
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,920
One of which is the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!

66
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,490
Seven Warlords?

67
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,960
Simply put, they're
government-authorized pirates.

68
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,330
What?

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,720
Why would pirates get
a government's approval?

70
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,910
By paying the government a cut
of the loot they take from pirates,

71
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,140
the Seven Warlords
are allowed to exist!

72
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,540
In other pirates' eyes, they're
no more than "government dogs,"

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,480
but they're strong!

74
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,910
Even Hawk-Eye Mihawk, the guy
Big Bro Zoro lost to, is a Warlord!

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,000
That's awesome!
There's seven of those guys?!

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,880
The Seven Warlords are awesome!

77
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,840
So, one of the Seven Warlords
is Jimbei, a fishman pirate boss.

78
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,280
And the fishman Arlong is
a pirate right on par with him

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,880
who used to commit atrocity
after atrocity in the Grand Line!

80
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,090
Like this?

81
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,050
That's just your last picture standing up!

82
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,840
Arlong has rule over 20 towns
since coming to the East Blue!

83
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,030
His strength is
far superior to Don Krieg's!

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,660
But why would Nami-san
go to this guy all by herself?

85
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,540
I told you, she's after
the bounty on his head!

86
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,330
No, who knows? Maybe Nami-san
is actually a mermaid!

87
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,510
Especially given how lovely she is!

88
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,470
"Nami"

89
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,060
Like this?!

90
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,470
I'll kill you!

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,290
Do you guys even understand
what I've told you?!

92
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,430
Yeah, there's a strong
fishman, right? We get it!

93
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,890
No, you don't get it!

94
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,390
You don't know how strong fishmen are!

95
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,390
We'll find out when we
get there. Quit worrying.

96
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,130
Anyways, let's have some food.

97
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Yeah! Food!

98
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,160
Eh? Food?

99
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,820
What do you want?

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Meat things with bones in it!

101
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,010
I want sautéed bean sprouts!

102
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,740
Alright! Leave it to me!

103
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,710
I'll be done in no time!

104
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,580
Meat and bean sprouts...

105
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,240
Having a cook really is great!

106
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,590
Y-Yeah!

107
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Meat! A jumbo serving of meat!

108
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,730
And bean sprouts for me!
A jumbo serving!

109
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm back here again...

110
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,030
My... hometown...

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,280
All right. Here is this
month's amount. Accept it.

112
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,010
Arlong-kun.

113
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,570
You're on a completely different level
of intellect than ordinary pirates.

114
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,020
You truly know how
to get ahead in the world.

115
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,620
Likewise!

116
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,980
Befriending me means you can
milk the East Blue all you want!

117
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,990
For a navy colonel,
you're wise to realize that!

118
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,770
Thanks as always.

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,230
Now you say that?

120
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,950
A good world is one in
which money flows well!

121
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,880
Money is good. You can
trust it more than anything.

122
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,840
Wouldn't you agree?

123
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,760
I-Indeed...

124
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,970
I hate humans, but good sports
like you are an exception.

125
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,220
Well, I should be going...

126
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,180
Come drink with us sometime!
Let's have fun!

127
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,180
It's not good for a navy ship on patrol
to be stopped at a pirate island.

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,840
I'll kill anyone for you
who tells headquarters.

129
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,960
No, I'll be leaving.

130
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,460
Hey! The colonel's heading back!

131
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,390
Take him to his ship!

132
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,160
Right!

133
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,130
Get in the octopus pot!
I'll take you there!

134
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,430
Right. Thanks.

135
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,090
But you always have such a funny face!

136
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,220
It looks just like a rat's!

137
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,140
Hey! Hachi! Watch your mouth!

138
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,020
The colonel is a valued guest!

139
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,520
Oh, right! Sorry!

140
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,490
No, it's all right.

141
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,140
Okay! Here we go!

142
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,160
You damn fishmen. You're creepy as hell.

143
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,730
But you're great as pay dirt!

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Hey, you! Out of the way!

145
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,250
I'm here to kill Arlong!

146
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,250
Arlong killed my daddy!

147
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,310
Move, or I'll kill you, too!

148
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,770
Hey!

149
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,080
Arlong doesn't have time to
bother with little brats like you!

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,820
Now go home!

151
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,940
Use that to at least keep yourself safe.

152
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,690
Darn it!

153
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,130
Oh! You're back, Nami!
That was a long trip!

154
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,740
Well? How was your haul this time?

155
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,300
Couldn't have gone better!
I earned a ton!

156
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,730
I found so many suckers who are
fooled so easily! As you can see!

157
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,690
Betrayal is your forte!

158
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,150
I guess.

159
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,880
Hey! Brothers! Our friend has returned!

160
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,410
Prepare a party!

161
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,370
It's Nami!

162
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,360
Nami's back!

163
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,810
W-W-We're finally here! Arlong Park!

164
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,110
So this is the hideout
of the fishman Arlong,

165
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,080
who came from the Grand Line?!

166
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,010
Is Nami really here?!

167
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,140
Big Sis Nami was on the Going Merry,

168
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,510
so let's first see if it's
stopped on this island or not!

169
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,770
G-Good idea!

170
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,510
We're busting in.

171
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,150
W-Why are we suddenly doing that?!

172
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,070
Are you stupid?!
We haven't even found any clues yet!

173
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,530
We're dealing with
those fishmen, you know!

174
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,610
We gotta have a strategy first!

175
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,450
Forget that tedious stuff.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,450
Luffy told me to bring her back.

177
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm gonna do just that,
no matter who we're dealing with!

178
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
Not good...

179
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,210
Let's go!

180
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,810
There it is! I found it!

181
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,770
It's the Going Merry! It's over there!

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
So Big Sis Nami is here!

183
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,770
Hey, you! What's the big idea?!

184
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,730
Untie me!

185
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,290
We're farther east of Arlong Park...
Cocoyashi Village.

186
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,860
But it's strange.

187
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,200
Why's the ship stopped
so far from the village?

188
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,030
Untie me!

189
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,980
You've been hurt so bad
you're nearly dead!

190
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,710
Just take it easy!

191
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,670
Just leave this all to me!

192
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,300
I am so going to chop him up someday!

193
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,500
I'll bring the girl back!

194
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,320
You're in high spirits, now that
you know she's not in Arlong Park...

195
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,280
Right rudder, full!
Pull the boat up to the Going Merry!

196
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,750
Right!

197
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,750
All right! I hereby title
this brave image of me

198
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,700
about to tread unknown soil,
"Captain Usopp's Grand Adventure"!

199
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,770
Are you alright?!

200
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,130
There! There!

201
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,840
Fishmen!

202
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,120
Full speed ahead!

203
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,370
Right!

204
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,010
Why did you just pass by it?!

205
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,480
Did you see that?!
There were fishmen there!

206
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,800
They're Arlong's crew! They're scary!
Somethin' wrong with that?!

207
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,350
Don't you snap at me!

208
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,850
I guess this whole area is
seriously under Arlong's control!

209
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,250
What now?

210
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,020
Alright! We'll just say we
couldn't bring Nami back!

211
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,900
Untie me, you idiots!

212
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,740
Never seen that boat before.

213
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,960
It's suspicious.

214
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,540
Escape!

215
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,300
Agreed!

216
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,710
Hold it, you two!

217
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,640
Bye!

218
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,890
Hey! At least untie me!

219
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,740
Huh? It's just him?

220
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,900
Were you banished from
somewhere or somethin'?

221
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,570
I-I guess...

222
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm gonna kill those guys!

223
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Ah! So you got these injuries
from being tortured!

224
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Alright! Let's take him
back to Arlong-san for now!

225
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,250
Forgive us, Zoro! I'll tell Luffy
you were a truly brave man!

226
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,420
What an unlucky person!
I'll never forget about you, Big Bro!

227
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,640
All right, then!
Let's get on dry land for now!

228
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Right!

229
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,730
There should be a town
called Gosa up here!

230
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,900
W-What happened to this town?!

231
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,000
I heard Arlong ravaged it
a few weeks back, but...

232
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,970
A-All the houses have been flipped over!

233
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,950
I hear fishmen generally have
ten times the strength of humans!

234
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,930
In short, could this be how strong
people from the Grand Line are?!

235
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,290
But how'd even the street get like this?

236
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,450
That was the doing
of a monster called Momoo.

237
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,990
Monster?

238
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,490
This place even has monsters?

239
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,990
We brought him from the Grand Line.

240
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,510
From the Grand Line, huh?

241
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,450
"We"?

242
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,320
You're with that guy who
got banished, aren't you?!

243
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,300
Bye!

244
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Get back here!

245
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,730
Escaped by a hair...

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,110
Please stay safe, Big Bro Usopp!

247
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,210
I'm going to wait here for
Yosaku and Big Bro Luffy!

248
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,180
As if a fishman can possibly
catch me on dry land!

249
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,350
I'm used to this!
Just try and catch up to me!

250
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,870
W-What the...

251
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,470
I found you, fishman!

252
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,110
You killed my daddy!
And I'm gonna kill you!

253
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,310
Don't mess with the fishmen!

254
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,470
Have you forgotten?!

255
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,540
Everyone here in Gosa

256
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,320
was slaughtered because just
one villager defied them!

257
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,700
Huh?

258
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,080
You look like a fishman,
but you're human. Just barely.

259
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,720
Just barely?!

260
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,100
Where are you?! Over there?!

261
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,010
He's coming!

262
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,980
A fishman!

263
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,610
There was a real one, too?

264
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
Get back!

265
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,000
I, Captain Usopp, will protect you!

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
I can handle one easily enough!

267
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,030
Take this! Special Attack: Lead Star!

268
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,180
No one ever listens!

269
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,090
I told you, the fishmen'll
kill us if we mess with them!

270
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,470
What is it?!

271
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,310
There was a long-nosed man!

272
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,310
Where'd he go?!

273
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,230
That way!

274
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,130
That way, huh?!

275
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,310
Hurry! We'll carry him to my house!

276
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,470
That looks great!

277
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,570
Lemme see, lemme see!

278
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,070
Guess that's good enough.

279
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,850
Momoo!

280
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,330
Time to eat! Momoo!

281
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,330
That's strange.

282
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,670
He should be starving by now...

283
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,290
Where could he have gone?

284
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,350
You're great, Big Bro Sanji!
This is topnotch seasoning!

285
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,680
I want to make dinner for Nami-san
more than I do for you guys.

286
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,240
I hope you manage to get
Big Sis Nami to join again!

287
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,620
We will! She's our navigator!

288
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,200
She's going to the Grand Line with us!

289
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,520
That's mine!

290
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,700
You just ate one! Let me have one, too!

291
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,310
--But it's mine!
--C'mon, just one!

292
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,150
--No! Give it back!
--C'mon! Let me have it!

293
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,250
Quit rockin' the damn boat!

294
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,250
You're going to make me
spill this fine alcohol!

295
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,680
Open the gate!

296
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,390
We've brought someone suspicious!

297
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,450
I'll ask again.

298
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,560
Just why have you come here?

299
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,960
I told you already-- I'm looking
for a girl! Half-fish bastard!

300
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,090
You've got a big mouth
for a lowly human.

301
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,930
I'll excuse you this time,
but never say "half-fish" again.

302
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,990
We fishmen are "evolved humans"

303
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,930
who've gained the ability
to breathe underwater.

304
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,210
Those fish abilities result
in us being superior to you.

305
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,100
As proof, we possess numerous
abilities that surpass those of humans!

306
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,860
Get it through your head that
fishmen are the lord of all things!

307
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Humans defying fishmen is basically
defying the laws of nature!

308
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sick of those ridiculous
opinions of yours, Arlong.

309
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,860
Don't look so stern, Nami.

310
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,020
You may be human,
but you're an exception.

311
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,890
You're a skilled surveyor and prized
member of the Arlong Pirates!

312
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,020
You make truly accurate
sea charts for us!

313
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,290
I have far more smarts than you guys.

314
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,850
It's only natural.

315
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,810
Hey! Nami! What does
he mean, "surveyor"?!

316
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,790
Why are you acting all
friendly-like with this guy?!

317
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,750
Oh? He's an acquaintance of yours?

318
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,820
Don't be ridiculous.
He was just my prey.

319
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I swiped a whole load of treasure
from this guy this time around.

320
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,260
To think he'd follow me here,
without any idea he'd been tricked...

321
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,790
Talk about unbelievably stupid.

322
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,420
So these are your true colors, huh?

323
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,240
After you hated pirates so much before.

324
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,430
Surprised? It was all an act.

325
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,380
Does this make it clear enough?

326
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,510
T-That's...

327
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,220
I'm a pirate, plain and simple!

328
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,690
And a leader of the Arlong Pirates!

329
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,870
My overflowing feelings don't connect

330
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,700
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

331
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,580
I'll set off by myself,

332
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,560
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

333
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,310
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

334
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,410
Why is it so hot?

335
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:55,410
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

336
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,710
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

337
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,550
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

338
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

339
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,650
With you, I can run there

340
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,640
Apparently Arlong and the
fishmen rule this village,

341
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,750
and no one can oppose them!

342
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,280
Eh? Don't tell me
fish cuisine isn't allowed.

343
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,500
I prefer meat with a bone in it!
Sanji! More meat!

344
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,150
To think she'd team up
with the fishmen...

345
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,540
Wasn't Nami one of us?!

346
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

347
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,450
"Witch of Cocoyashi Village!
Arlong's Female Leader"

348
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
