00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,210
W-What the hell...
are you guys doing?!

25
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,800
What do you mean?
We're here to get Nami.

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,170
Oh, yeah. Where are Usopp and Johnny?

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,160
Usopp! T-That's right!

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,030
There's no time to be
loafing around here!

29
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,990
What's wrong?!

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,770
That bastard's been caught by Arlong!

31
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,770
We gotta hurry before he's killed!

32
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,970
He was killed!

33
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,890
What?!

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,460
Big Bro Usopp is dead!

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,830
He was killed!

36
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,650
By Big Sis Nami!

37
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,400
"Everyone's Gathered!
Usopp Speaks the Truth About Nami"

38
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,130
Are you serious?!

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,940
Yeah. It's terrible!

40
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,040
She was a witch all along!

41
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,210
She's been winning Arlong's favor

42
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,380
so she could have the treasure buried
in Cocoyashi Village all to herself!

43
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,100
She'll calmly kill people for it, too!

44
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,660
She's scum, rotten to the core!

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,010
She had us all fooled the entire--

46
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,890
You!

47
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,950
Try saying that again! I'll kick your ass!

48
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,030
Stop, Luffy. This has
nothing to do with Johnny.

49
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,200
If you don't wanna
believe me, then don't!

50
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,370
But I saw it with my own two eyes!

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,070
She killed Big Bro Usopp--

52
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,340
Quit spouting nonsense!
Nami would never kill Usopp!

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,040
We're friends!

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,560
B-But, I...

55
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,470
Who're friends, Luffy?

56
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,690
Nami!

57
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,470
Why are you here?

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,210
What're you talking about?

59
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,910
You're our friend! We came to get you!

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,790
You're a big problem.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,640
Nami?

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,460
Friends? Don't make me laugh!

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,150
You're just a pathetic bunch of
people cooperating with each other.

64
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,070
Damn you! You killed him!
I saw it with my own eyes!

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,110
How dare... How dare
you kill Big Bro Usopp?!

66
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,080
So what? Why not kill me
as revenge, then?

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
What?!

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,130
I'll tell you this much.

69
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,310
Right now, Arlong wants to kill
Roronoa Zoro and his men.

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,090
Because Zoro just had to be stupid.

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,770
No matter how monstrously
strong you guys are,

72
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,060
you're no match for real monsters.

73
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,810
If you hang around this island,
you will wind up being killed.

74
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,760
Not that it matters to me, though.

75
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,020
Her cool look is so enchanting, too!

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,690
Hi, Nami-san! It's me!
Do you remember me?!

77
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,640
Let's set sail together!

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,750
Shut up, you!
You're just complicating things!

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,690
Say what?! Love is always a hurricane!

80
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,550
Hey! Listen when people are talking!

81
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,660
Where's Usopp?

82
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,560
Bottom of the ocean.

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
Damn it! Cut the crap!

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,500
A swordsman would even
strike a lady, Roronoa Zoro?

85
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,300
What?! You don't even know
what's going on here! Back off!

86
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,020
I guess I'd be irritated too,
coming right off an insulting defeat.

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,050
Huh?!

88
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,140
Hey! Watch that mouth of yours!

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,740
Mind your own business,
you damn bastard!

90
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,230
Bros! This is no time for
you two to be going at it!

91
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,570
That's right!

92
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,360
If you're going to fight,
could you do it off the island?!

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,640
Don't butt any more into this
land's affairs, you outsiders!

94
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,760
Do you still not get it?

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,430
The one and only reason I got
close to you was for the money!

96
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,740
Now that you're flat broke,
you have no charm whatsoever!

97
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,940
You can have your ship back,

98
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,900
so just go find a navigator somewhere
and go into the Grand Line!

99
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,420
Go look for your One Piece or whatever!

100
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,220
Just get the hell out of here!
You're an eyesore!

101
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,720
Goodbye.

102
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,020
Nami...

103
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,780
Big Bro Luffy?!

104
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm going to sleep.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,870
Sleep?!

106
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,290
In this situation?! And right
in the middle of the road?!

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't plan on leaving the island,

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,870
and I'm not interested in
what's happening on the island.

109
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,290
And I'm a little sleepy.

110
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,960
--I'm going to sleep.
--Huh?!

111
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,620
B-Big Bro...

112
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,270
Fine...

113
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,480
Fine, whatever!
Go ahead and die!

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,300
Na--

115
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,360
Hurry! Hurry!

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,640
What's the big deal?!

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,410
It's the navy! The navy's here!

118
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,010
Some survivors from Gosa
managed to contact the government!

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,560
The navy's come here to pick us up!

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
See?

121
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,320
We're saved!

122
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,200
We can finally escape this island!

123
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,030
So that's the infamous Arlong Park...

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,720
The world's on its last legs if
pirates can settle down so blatantly.

125
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,340
Listen, men!

126
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,580
Our mission today is to
successfully extract from the island

127
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,460
the survivors of the town of Gosa,

128
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,450
which was destroyed
by the Arlong Pirates!

129
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,690
But I am left to wonder...

130
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,420
Would our brand of justice
allow us to overlook the castle

131
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,370
of this unchecked pirate?!

132
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,290
It would not!

133
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,620
Our unit will now annihilate
Arlong and his men!

134
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,070
Prepare for battle at once!

135
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,880
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,640
Navy Branch #77?

137
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,670
Yes. That's what it said.

138
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,970
A newcomer.

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,940
Someone go there and negotiate
with the head honcho.

140
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,510
If two million isn't enough

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,280
to keep them from trying
anything funny, get rid of 'em!

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,950
They're suddenly opening fire!

143
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,580
Arlong-san! Look out!

144
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,360
H-He crunched a cannonball!

145
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,460
What terrifying jaws and teeth!

146
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,090
Arlong-san. The negotiations?

147
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,670
Canceled.

148
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,670
Alright! Let's go!

149
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,580
Time to fight!

150
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,350
It'll be a navy bloodbath!

151
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,190
Not so fast, guys.

152
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,980
There's no need to expend so much
energy just to take out the trash.

153
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,670
We'll go!

154
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,370
What foolish humans they are to pick
a fight with us in these waters.

155
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,840
Three of our leaders'll
make for a grand fight!

156
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,720
That ship won't last even three minutes!

157
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,340
That's odd...

158
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,450
Commodore! The cannonball
appears to have been a dud!

159
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,430
Fire another! This is a
signal of open hostility!

160
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,750
We're dealing with fishmen!
Don't let your guard down, men!

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,640
Yes, sir!

162
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,030
He's been hit!
It's one of Arlong's men!

163
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,440
Get him! Commence attack!

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,630
Stop! Remain calm!

165
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,740
One of Arlong's men, yes?

166
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,740
I am Commodore Purinpurin
of Navy Branch #77.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,070
We are a somewhat
well-known elite naval unit!

168
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,500
If you do not wish for death,
I suggest you dutifully surrender--

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,950
Commodore!

170
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,530
How dare you?!

171
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,710
Kill him!

172
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,440
W-What's this shock?!

173
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,460
Don't tell me there's
fishmen under the ship?!

174
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,590
I'm sorry to bother you like this,

175
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,270
but we just took the liberty
of removing your ship's rudder.

176
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,020
--W-What?!
--Commodore! Are you all right?!

177
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,500
Don't worry.
I didn't hit any vital spots.

178
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,010
This is just hypothetical, Commodore,

179
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,690
but if one were to move a large reef
directly into a strong current,

180
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,330
what do you suppose
would happen to the ocean?

181
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
What?!

182
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,380
M-Moving a reef?!

183
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,800
That can't possibly be done!

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,030
Alright! Right around there, Hachi!

185
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,140
Right!

186
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,970
C-Commodore!

187
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,000
A giant whirlpool has
suddenly appeared ahead!

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,430
The rudder's not working!

189
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,310
What?!

190
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,300
I told you. We removed the rudder.

191
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,460
This rudderless ship is now headed...

192
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,280
...into the depths of the sea.

193
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,760
This can't be happening...

194
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,510
This is reality.

195
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,920
There's no way we can escape
from Arlong's control.

196
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,970
Sorry to make you work so hard!

197
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,280
Not at all. We know
everything about these waters,

198
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,870
from the winds to the
depths. It was a cinch.

199
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,540
With our top skills, we have
no one to fear in these seas!

200
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,510
And let's not forget Nami's sea charts.

201
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,950
I moved the reef after checking that!

202
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,350
It even tells the flow of
the currents and everything!

203
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,780
Those are some excellent
charts, all right!

204
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,440
If we have Nami draw up charts
of all the world's oceans,

205
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,050
we'll be the eternal kings of the sea!

206
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,000
Nami's definitely vital to have for
the creation of the Arlong Empire!

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,100
It's a real shame!

208
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,200
A shame?

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
He promised to let Nami
and Cocoyashi Village go

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,280
once she saves up 100 million Berries.

211
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,530
For reals, Arlong-san?!

212
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,630
You're really going to let Nami go?!

213
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,080
For reals, for reals?! That's a big waste!

214
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,890
It can't be helped.

215
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,710
That's what we agreed
to eight years ago.

216
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,190
I'm a man who'd die to keep
my money-related promises.

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,810
Hey, Big Bro Zoro!

218
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,180
What on earth are you thinking?!

219
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,080
Arlong is out to kill us!

220
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,840
So why aren't we running away?!

221
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,970
Now that we know
what Nami's really like,

222
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,860
there should be no reason
at all to stay on this island!

223
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,990
A reason for staying on
this island? There is one.

224
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,170
He's staying here.

225
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,380
Don't tell us you're still gonna try
to get her back too, Big Bro Zoro!

226
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,350
I have nothing to do with it.

227
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,540
He decides who we have as navigator.

228
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,210
Big Bro...

229
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,430
A-All right! Understood!

230
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,860
It was a short reunion,
but our role as guides ends here!

231
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,640
Same for me! I don't wanna
deliberately wind up killed!

232
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,520
Yeah. Take care.

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,010
Well, until we meet again!

234
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,780
Stay well, you guys!

235
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,900
You, too!

236
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,010
Hey.

237
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah?

238
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,760
Why do you suppose
Nami-san was crying?

239
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,280
She was crying?

240
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
Inside her heart.

241
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,110
You sure they weren't tears
of grief for killing Usopp?

242
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,220
Yeah, right. Are you serious?

243
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,700
Do you honestly believe
Nami-san killed Long-nose?

244
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,630
When she did that...!

245
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,340
It's for my business!

246
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
This was my only choice!

247
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,150
When she did that,

248
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,040
Nami stabbed her own hand to
make it look like she stabbed me!

249
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,040
If Nami hadn't done that for me,
Arlong would've killed me for sure!

250
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,070
What now?!

251
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,950
Manly Usopp can't just turn tail
after being saved!

252
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,160
For now, I gotta hurry and find Zoro!

253
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,610
Is that... Zoro?!

254
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,260
It is! Yes!

255
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,450
Nami didn't kill him.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

256
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,880
Am I wrong?

257
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,880
I wonder.

258
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,010
I did make her out to be a small fry
who can't even watch a guy die.

259
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,470
She might've done it out of frustration.

260
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,930
Whadya mean, "small fry"?!

261
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,100
What's so small about
Nami-san's chest?!

262
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,860
Is that all you can think--

263
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,600
He's alive!

264
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,410
No, I think he's dead now...

265
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,820
Usopp!

266
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,100
Did Nami do this to you?!

267
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,170
Sorry. Me and him did that.

268
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,400
You did it!

269
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,680
L-Luffy! You're here?!

270
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,080
Yeah. Just got here.

271
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,300
Oh, I came too!
Good to work with you!

272
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,230
Someday I'm gonna kill you!

273
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,420
Oh! You're pretty alright after all!

274
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,300
Shut up!

275
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,730
Speaking of which,
we heard Nami killed you.

276
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,430
Eh?!

277
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,040
That damn Johnny!
He was talking nonsense after all!

278
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,630
No... In a way, it's not a lie...

279
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,740
But it's actually the opposite! Nami saved my life!

280
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
You really know how to trash a place.

281
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,270
What's wrong, Nami?

282
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,200
Nothing. I'm just here to rest a little.

283
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,590
Breaking glass and furniture
just to rest is a bit much.

284
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,950
You have that treasure map open
even though nothing's wrong?

285
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,660
Something happened to
make me mad, that's all!

286
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,870
Them, huh? Who are they?

287
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,240
You met them?!

288
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,130
Yeah. Some Captain
Something-or-Other.

289
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,470
He seemed kind of liar-ish, though.

290
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,950
I hear you smiled happily when
you were traveling with them.

291
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,840
Even though I haven't
seen you like that in years.

292
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,470
Talk to me! Who are those guys?

293
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,640
We agreed you could tell me
anything, remember?

294
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,520
I had planned to forget about them...

295
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,090
I thought I had erased
them from my mind.

296
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,380
Yes! I'm out!

297
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,710
Darn it! You win all
by yourself again?!

298
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,960
Wait, hold on, Luffy!
Why do you have so many cards?!

299
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,260
I get the feeling having more is better!

300
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
You idiot!

301
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,430
Learn the rules already!

302
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,630
Alright! Then let's say
the one with the most wins!

303
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,860
Alright, it's decided!

304
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,730
But the more I tried to erase them,
the more I remembered...

305
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,410
Quit deciding on your own!

306
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,020
Oh, crap! We sprung a leak!

307
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,330
Hurry! Stop it!

308
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,230
Alright! Leave it to me!

309
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,480
Quit thrashing around!

310
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,370
The truth is, I once forgot
the fate I bear for a short while...

311
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,440
Who do you take your friends for?!

312
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:49,230
I honestly felt like always being
with them, if it were possible.

313
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,380
Now I see...

314
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,730
Yeah, that'd hit you hard.

315
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,920
To think that someone
really showed up for her...

316
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,110
Friends, huh?

317
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,540
The most painful word for her...

318
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,800
So that's how Nami pretended
to kill me and let me escape!

319
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,420
It looks to me like there's a reason
she's in a fishman pirate group!

320
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,880
Obviously.

321
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,750
So, what do we do?
Do we storm Arlong Park?

322
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,070
H-Hold on! We gotta find out what
the story with Nami is first!

323
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,720
It's no use, either way.

324
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,080
No matter what you guys do,
Arlong's rule won't come to an end.

325
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,100
Nojiko!

326
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,450
Who's she?

327
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,560
Nami's big sister.

328
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,260
N-Nami-san's older sister?!
No wonder she's so beautiful!

329
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,060
What do you mean it's no use?

330
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,950
Please, don't get any more
involved with this village.

331
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,940
Leave Nami alone.

332
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,780
I'll explain the circumstances.

333
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,910
Circumstances?

334
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,040
You mean why she
joined Arlong's group?

335
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,760
Yes. You'll feel like leaving
the island once you hear it.

336
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,880
Alright. Let's hear this
reason or whatever, then.

337
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,820
I'll pass.

338
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,670
H-Hey!

339
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,850
I don't care about her past.

340
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,440
Where are you going, Luffy?

341
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,530
For a walk.

342
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,820
A-A walk?! You're not
gonna listen to this?!

343
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,130
No. I'll pass.

344
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,600
Who's he?

345
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,670
Don't mind him.
That's just how he is.

346
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,150
We'll hear you out.

347
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,570
Though I don't think
it's gonna change anything.

348
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,840
Yeah! I'll listen, too!

349
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,530
I wanna know what's
happening on this island!

350
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,500
Me, too! I want to know
everything about Nami-san!

351
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,720
And now he's sleeping.

352
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,620
Don't sleep right after you say that!

353
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,030
I see. This is why Nami
had such a hard time.

354
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,980
There's a navy ship at the shore?!

355
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,320
It's Branch #16's ship!

356
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,300
Maybe Headquarters is taking action

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,140
after what happened to Branch #77?!

358
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,730
I am Colonel Nezumi of Navy Branch #16!

359
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,190
Bring me Genzo, the
representative of Cocoyashi Village!

360
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,690
I'm Genzo, Colonel.

361
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,490
You, huh? Lead me to the
house of the girl named Nami.

362
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,410
Nami? But what on earth for?!

363
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,400
You simply need to lead the way.

364
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,600
It all goes back to eight years ago...

365
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,290
To that day, when we
were still little children...

366
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,170
She was in this village.

367
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,650
Me and Nami will never forget
her as long as we live...

368
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,390
Her name was Bellemere.

369
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

370
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

371
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,620
I'll set off by myself,

372
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,600
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

373
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,350
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

374
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,450
Why is it so hot?

375
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:55,450
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

376
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,750
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

377
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

378
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

379
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

380
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,100
Bellemere! What a beautiful girl's name!

381
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,620
How I'd love to meet her!

382
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,150
Hey, are Bellemeres yummy?

383
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,740
It's not food! It's the person
Nami-san will never forget!

384
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,910
Meaning she could be Nami-san's...
Nami-san's... Nami-san's...!

385
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,490
Shut up! I can't sleep, Sanji!

386
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,720
Are you guys even serious
about listening to Nojiko?

387
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

388
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,790
"Untold Past! Female Warrior Bellemere!"

389
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
