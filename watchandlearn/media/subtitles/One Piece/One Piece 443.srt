2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,640
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,640
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,170
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,770
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,270
The crew, on its way to the New World,

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,770
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,030
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,960
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,200
who has been captured by the Navy.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,330
Luffy got to level 6 along with
the queen of New Kama Land Ivankov

53
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,290
but Ace was already gone!

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,330
You better not resist because it's useless!

55
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,560
Luffy!

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,010
Your brother is also a pirate! There's
no way that he'll walk out of here alive.

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,890
I wished that she was lying!
Why did you come, Luffy?!

58
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,810
It's simple but their plan defeated us!

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,900
We're confined to level 6! There's
no way for us to get out!

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,530
They'll hand over Ace boy to the
Navy Headquarters at any cost!

61
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,520
You need to give up on him!

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,700
I mean, you need to trust Whitebeard.

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,120
He's not gonna give up on one of his
own! He'll definitely do something!

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
--I'm going!
--Huh?!

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,380
I'm gonna go to Navy Headquarters!

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,340
If I give up now...

67
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,210
...I'm gonna regret it!

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,530
But first of all, how can
you get off of this floor?!

69
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,190
If you wanna get out of here, set me free!

70
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,830
I can create a hole on the ceiling!

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
What do you think?

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,950
Crocodile!

73
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,420
It's been a while!

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,860
Straw Hat!

75
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,830
"The Ultimate Team Has
Formed! Shaking Impel Down!"

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,280
I thought that there was no
reason to get back on the street

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,510
but Whitebeard and the Navy
are gonna start a war?

78
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,500
It's my chance to finally
bring down that old man!

79
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,480
This war has piqued my interest.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,380
And with my power, you and
I could get out of here.

81
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,590
It's not bad, huh? We both get what we want.

82
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,330
Screw you!

83
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,340
--You're the man who messed up Vivi's country!
--That was a long time ago.

84
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,540
I lost interest in that country.

85
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,920
Let's release him, Straw boy.

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,130
His power will aid us greatly.

87
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,090
What?! Ivan-chan! If you
knew what he's done...

88
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,250
You wanna keep going, right?!

89
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,510
If you wanna make it to
Navy HQ,  you need him!

90
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,850
Ivankov!

91
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,310
Long time no see, Croco boy!

92
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,270
Y-You know him?

93
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,610
Just a passing acquaintance! I met
him when he was just a rookie!

94
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,190
Don't worry!

95
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,250
I can bring him under control
in case he tries to betray us.

96
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,620
I can't trust him at all!

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,920
But I know one of his weaknesses!

98
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,290
Hey, if you so much as say it...

99
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,670
Oh? Do you wanna take that tone?

100
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,240
If you like, I can just
reveal your past here.

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,640
But, if you just shut up and help
us, I keep the secret for Y-O-U!

102
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,930
Heehaw!

103
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,230
You bastard!

104
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,630
Why don't you release me, too?!

105
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,570
Me, too! I have something against Whitebeard!

106
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,280
Let me out, too!

107
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,040
Shut up!

108
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,910
Death Wink!

109
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,090
Have mercy on me!

110
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,390
Take me with you! I can help you for sure!

111
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,650
I have known Ace-san ever since
he joined the Whitebeards!

112
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,320
He always told me about his brother!

113
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,570
I was arrested because I objected to the war!

114
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,910
I wanna save Ace-san, too! So please!

115
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,120
Let me die for him!

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,890
Such a strong bond between a Warlord
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei and...

117
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,130
...the second division commander
of the Whitebeards--Portgaz D. Ace!

118
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,130
I never would have guessed!

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,110
-- Alright.
-- Are you sure?!

120
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,190
We don't know about him
and how dangerous he is!

121
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,780
It's okay! Let him out!

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,450
Thank you!

123
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,200
--Hey, I'll thank you, too!
--Have mercy on me, too!

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,830
Shut up! Death Wink!

125
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,810
A Warlord and a former
Warlord both on our team.

126
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,140
Two of them? Who is the other one?

127
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,980
I appreciate this! Now I can be of some help.

128
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,030
Maybe you can stop the war between
the Whitebeards and the Navy

129
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,450
but it's a waste of time.

130
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,040
Because I'm gonna get that old man anyway.

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,460
I won't let you even touch good
old Whitebeard, Crocodile!

132
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,750
Then, do you wanna just fight me here?

133
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,220
Croco boy--your secret past?

134
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,010
Alright, we don't have much time!

135
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,640
We're gonna just break out by force!

136
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,600
Heehaw!

137
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,230
Straw Hat, Ivankov, Inazuma,
they're all Devil Fruit eaters!

138
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,150
Don't forget the Prison Bullets!

139
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,370
We've reached level 6!

140
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,740
Move in!

141
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,300
What's this stone thing?

142
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,880
N-No way!

143
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,340
Are they still here?! Go look!

144
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,430
Do you really think that they stayed
here after making that hole, stupid?

145
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,110
S-Shiryu, the Jail Manager!

146
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,530
See, you guys? You can't do
anything right without me.

147
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,990
You're doing your job so poorly!

148
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,250
This is a huge mess and the
embarrassment of Impel Down!

149
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,880
The three that you're looking for
released Crocodile and Jimbei and...

150
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
...climbed up through the hole to level 5!

151
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,800
Tell Magellan now  that I
can help him if he wants!

152
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,430
No, that's...

153
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,310
W-What?!

154
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,980
They took Crocodile and Jimbei?!

155
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,730
Yes, they're not in their cells!

156
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,110
No! Does it mean that I thought
that I confined them to level 6

157
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,440
but that I've been outsmarted?

158
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,990
There're now five of them and
they're on level 5, right?

159
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,070
That's right!

160
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,540
Do you think that  I'm
responsible for any of this?

161
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,200
Warden Magellan is
convoying Portgaz D. Ace

162
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,590
so I think that you're
responsible for all of this!

163
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,050
I'm responsible for all of this?!

164
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,390
Alright, I'm gonna fight, too!

165
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,260
All jailers must go back to level 4!

166
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,470
Sadie-chan, Saldeath!

167
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,100
Go to level 4 with all of your people now!

168
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,940
I'd risk my own life to become Warden!

169
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,020
I mean, risk your own lives to stop them!

170
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,540
Are you ready, Bon boy?

171
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Y-Yes, Ivan-san!

172
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,500
You sure?

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,710
Emporio Energy Hormone is just
for you to recover for today.

174
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,630
There'll be after effects!

175
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,970
I know! Go ahead!

176
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I mean if you don't, I can barely move!

177
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,430
Oh yeah! You're right!

178
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,980
You got me there!

179
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,810
Emporio Energy...

180
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,650
...Hormone!

181
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh! I injected it into
your crotch by mistake!

182
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,990
New Kama Land!

183
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,740
Bon-chan! Don't die!

184
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,160
Are you ready?

185
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,750
Even if we manage to get to
the  front door of the prison,

186
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,830
we'll still be in for a fight!

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,120
There's the Calm Belt all
around us which is impassable!

188
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,000
We have to steal a Navy ship
to go to the Navy Headquarters!

189
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,050
We just need to get more
people to fight with us!

190
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,010
To be honest, we already have a lot but...

191
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,520
...only a few of you can
make it  to the top floor!

192
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,730
If you are captured, you'll
be tortured to death!

193
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,030
So if you wanna survive,

194
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,910
you need to set free as many prisoners
as you can from levels 1 through 5!

195
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,700
If we can start a riot,
we'll keep our foes busy!

196
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,000
We have to steal the keys and set
as many as we can free on our way!

197
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,260
Let's unleash mayhem in Impel Down
such as has never been seen before!

198
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,630
Heehaw!

199
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's go, Straw boy!

200
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,810
Oh?

201
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,600
He went ahead.

202
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,730
What a free spirit! Heehaw!

203
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,460
Let's catch up with him, candies!

204
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,440
Wait! Please somebody stop me!

205
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,740
I'm going way too fast!
It's faster than usual!

206
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,040
The hormone is working overtime!

207
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,620
Yeah, but it must be  nice to move like that.

208
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,520
It's not always nice!

209
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,950
The biggest trouble in the history
of Impel Down is now gone!

210
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,290
Back to your posts and
clean up the mess inside!

211
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,630
It's before 10 in the morning!

212
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,170
The execution is at 3 in the afternoon.

213
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,800
They'll definitely do it on time!

214
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,060
If Whitebeard is going to do something,
he'll do it hours before that!

215
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,140
Ace should already be on the ship!

216
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,110
The war could begin anytime now!

217
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,190
But he's not gonna get killed until 3!

218
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,760
Which means that we still have a chance!

219
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,700
Doors can't stop me!

220
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,460
I'll turn it into sand with my right hand.

221
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,500
Let's see how Crocodile's
Sand-Sand Fruit power works!

222
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,090
He can turn into sand and control it.

223
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,800
With his right hand, he can
suck any type of moisture

224
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,260
so people and plants will wither
and rocks and land turn to sand!

225
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,280
T-They're coming!

226
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
T-This is level 4!

227
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,660
The prisoner who escaped from
level 6 - is a Warlord Jimbei!

228
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,460
This is the Burning Heat Hell!

229
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,240
The intruder--Monkey D. Luffy!

230
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,340
It's hot!

231
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,590
A former Warlord Crocodile!
They're here! So we will fight!

232
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,840
Shoot!

233
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Stupid! Use the Prison Bullets!

234
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,500
Crescent Cutlass!

235
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,720
Shoot the Prison Bullets!

236
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,230
Gum-Gum...

237
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,450
...Rain!

238
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,150
Fish-Man Karate!

239
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,080
W-What was it?!

240
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,480
What's happening?!

241
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
Arabesque Brick Fist!

242
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,820
We're no match for them - an
infamous rookie and two Warlords!

243
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,070
D-Don't stop!

244
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,660
Hold out until backups will get
here! We're outnumbering them!

245
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,160
Get out of our way! We're in hurry!

246
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,830
Let's just go!

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,730
You fools! Shoot them up!

248
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,060
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank!

249
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,940
What's up?!

250
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,730
--Vice Warden, this is level 4!
--You did it?!

251
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,610
No, actually...

252
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,570
Please come help us!

253
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,160
H-Hurry up! Damn it! Dash!

254
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,540
Camisole!

255
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,410
Long johns!

256
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,460
T-back!

257
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,690
--Pantyhose!
--Briefs!

258
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,550
--Leggings!
--Briefs!

259
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,710
Bra!

260
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,080
Bloomers!

261
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,720
Bloomers! Briefs!

262
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,600
Briefs!

263
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,430
Briefs!

264
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,310
Sorry to keep you waiting!

265
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,440
Here comes the funny part!

266
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,530
Damn! Why're they hanging out
here? Those underwear fetishists!

267
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,530
They're so relaxed!

268
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,560
Finally we got to level 2!

269
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,780
If they find us, all of our efforts will come to nothing!

270
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,620
But their farts really stink!

271
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,950
Oh yeah!

272
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,300
You!

273
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,100
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,810
--S-Smells like burdock...
--Sorry...

275
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,840
Wow, the key! We can get out!

276
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
Thank you very much!

277
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,580
Oh, you're C-Crocodile!

278
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,250
I'm thinking about breaking out
but I need some assistants.

279
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,630
Do you wanna come with me?

280
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,130
Mr. 1!

281
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,200
I'll come with you because you asked me.

282
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,950
I was just starting to get bored.

283
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,600
Trying to break through level 4, Luffy and the others rush forward.

284
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,670
And the prisoners on level 2 begin to riot.

285
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,540
Impel Down is engulfed in chaos.

286
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,140
And to make things even more crazy,

287
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,390
an unknown ship shows up.

288
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,220
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,060
"Even More Chaos! Here Comes Blackbeard Teech!"

290
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
