00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,770
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,740
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:06,490
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,420
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,560
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,360
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,110
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

78
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,910
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

79
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,040
But they have yet to gather and are
stirring things up as a fragmented crew!

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,290
We're gonna restore his dream!

81
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,630
We're the New Fish-Man Pirates!

82
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,380
Shark Grip!

83
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,680
--No! I tell you this is no good!
--What should we do?!

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,850
Nami-chin?

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,480
Camie, do me a favor!

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,650
What?

87
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,860
Zoro! The water is rising!

88
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,320
I have a favor to ask!
Let those two get out of here!

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,410
What about you?

90
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,160
No one can get away with
that guy chasing after them!

91
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,250
Don't stand in my way of
conquering this country!

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,430
Um... Well, uh...

93
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,260
You found me!

94
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,180
She's big! Don't tell me that that is...

95
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,060
Oh, no.

96
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,060
They kidnapped the Mermaid Princess!

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,070
No, Sanji! Don't turn around at any cost!

98
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,240
Huh? What's going on?

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,450
If you do, you're gonna die, Sanji!

100
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:16,580
"Keep Shirahoshi Safe!
Decken Close Behind!"

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,390
I'm coming! To wherever my Shirahoshi is!

102
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,060
It's dead or marriage!

103
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,120
P-Princess Shirahoshi has...

104
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,000
...really been...

105
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,670
...kidnapped!

106
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,170
Hey, Coward! Why did you come out of Shark?!

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,770
I-I'm sorry! Luffy-sama,
please don't get mad at me!

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,980
He made Princess-sama cry!
What an evil pirate!

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,070
I feel terrible... Princess Shirahoshi-sama!

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,700
Princess...

111
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,370
He said "Princess"! Don't tell me that's...

112
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,670
No, Sanji!

113
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,550
Don't turn around at any cost!

114
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,890
Hey, could it be that the
Mermaid Princess is behind me...

115
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,310
...if I turn around?

116
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,890
Yes, she's there! That's why I don't
want you to turn around, Sanji!

117
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,690
You almost died after seeing
some average Mermaids!

118
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,780
So if you see the Mermaid Princess,

119
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,910
you'll lose all of your blood
and it's curtains for you!

120
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,710
Mermaid Princess...

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,460
They say even the most beautiful woman

122
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,050
in the world - Pirate Empress Boa
Hancock's looks pale in comparison.

123
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,930
She is the most gorgeous of all Mermaids.
And now, she's behind my back...

124
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,730
No! I beg you! Don't turn around!

125
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,320
Chopper.

126
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,780
Rather than live a day longer without
grasping at a dream within reach,

127
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,080
I will live out my dream...

128
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,080
...and choose to die!

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,790
What?! I thought your dream
was to go to the All Blue!

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,180
No!

131
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,810
Sanji!

132
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,900
Huh?

133
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,270
Th-Th-That is...

134
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,610
Now I know how poor my imagination is!

135
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,280
She's magnificent!

136
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,540
That's quite simply...

137
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,040
...a beauty that you can't even draw!

138
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,340
He turned to stone!

139
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,130
Princess Shirahoshi-sama!

140
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,050
We gotta rescue her!

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,470
But they're the Straw Hats who are
strong enough to occupy the palace!

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,190
I thought he'd die from a nosebleed.

143
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,570
But he turned to stone! That's new.

144
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,530
Maybe because of his blood donors!

145
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,870
L-Luffy-sama, I don't know... what to do...

146
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,920
Hey, are you okay?!

147
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,090
In any case, Hachi, who did this to you?!

148
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,520
Hey, what do you guys want?!

149
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,320
--We caught them!
--The Straw Hats! We did it!

150
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,780
We are sea hunters who risk our lives
to catch the Sea Kings everyday!

151
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,740
Pirates are no match for us!

152
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,490
Don't mess with the sea hunters!

153
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,750
--The Sea hunters did it!
--Great!

154
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,210
You guys are fishermen?! We're not fish!

155
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,170
I remember you, too! You're the punk
who used to be in Arlong's group!

156
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,300
You're safe now, Princess-sama!

157
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,850
Turn them over to the Ammo Knights
so they can cut their heads off!

158
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,350
Um... It's not like that, everybody.
Luffy-sama was not...

159
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,110
Hey guys!
Something's flying towards us! There!

160
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,440
Huh? It's no use--we're not gonna be fooled!

161
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,820
What?! Hey, something's really flying!

162
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,500
Is it just some coral?

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,290
No, somebody's on it.

164
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,420
Oh no! That's...

165
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,250
...Vander Decken!

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,550
I found you! I suspect!

167
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,350
Shirahoshi!

168
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,020
Vander Decken-sama!

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,100
He must've been hiding for a long time
and now he's finally showed himself!

170
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,190
Princess-sama, run! We'll handle this!

171
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,490
I want your answer, Shirahoshi!
If it's "Yes," you can escape death!

172
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,370
You have to...

173
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,670
...marry me!

174
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,760
You've been throwing weapons
at her for 10 years to kill her

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,220
and now you wanna marry her?!

176
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,100
Stop messing around, Vander Decken!

177
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,600
The Princess must have feared
death for 10 years because of you!

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,730
How dare you propose to her!

179
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,570
I want your answer, Shirahoshi!
I suspect it's "Yes"!

180
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,880
Um...

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,590
What do you wanna say?! "Yes"?!

182
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Y...

183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:30,720
You're not my type!

184
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,440
What?

185
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,110
No!

186
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,700
What?! Is that the reason?!

187
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,000
Y... Y... Y... Y...

188
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,290
You bitch!

189
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,340
You trampled on my feelings of 10
years and now who will you marry?!

190
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,340
If you don't love me,
your very existence irritates me!

191
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,850
Drop dead, Shirahoshi!

192
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,100
Run, Princess Shirahoshi!

193
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,810
Hurry up! We'll stop him here with our lives!

194
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,270
Don't go anywhere! Stay there, Coward!

195
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,570
What are you saying?!
We can't trust you pirates!

196
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,950
You're Decken's accomplice,
aren't you? You want her to die?!

197
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,450
If you run somewhere, I can't keep you safe!

198
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,950
O-Okay, I'll stay!

199
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,870
Princess-sama!

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
--How dare you scare her!
--You evil pirate!

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,300
Sorry guys. I have nothing
against you but you're...

202
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,170
...in my way!

203
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,140
Second Gear!

204
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,850
Luffy!

205
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,070
He did it with his hands tied!

206
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,160
Why do you wanna interfere with
my business with Shirahoshi?!

207
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,580
Are you the one who took Shirahoshi out?

208
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,130
Are you the one...

209
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,250
...that's been throwing things at Coward?!

210
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,720
I'll kill you both! Let me put you two
together and cut you into quarters!

211
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,220
Try it!

212
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,770
L-Let me go!

213
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,640
Gum-Gum...

214
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,480
...Jet...

215
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,440
...Hammer!

216
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,060
Th...

217
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,560
That guy...

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,270
...beat Vander Decken!

219
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,740
He's still moving but we can catch him now!

220
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,500
Shark! Wake up!

221
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,830
Sanji!

222
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,290
You alright?!

223
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,430
He turned to stone a while ago but
he looks happy now. He's conscious!

224
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,550
Okay, got it.

225
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,060
Mermaid Princess... Am
I in heaven or paradise?

226
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,850
My dream came true! I can die now!

227
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,650
Again, your dream was to go
to the All Blue, wasn't it?

228
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,820
Hurry up, Coward!

229
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,780
O-Okay!

230
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,250
Please don't yell at me.
It makes my heart race.

231
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,710
The people on this island
don't like us for some reason.

232
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,710
We've got to get away from here!

233
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,510
Thank you! Coward! Let's go!

234
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,550
Okay!

235
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,010
P-Princess-sama, why did you untie him?

236
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,810
That evil pirate must've scared her again!

237
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,060
I am sorry, everybody! I
will be back by dinner!

238
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,230
What?

239
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,860
Go Shark!

240
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,330
Get away, you shits!

241
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't let them get away!

242
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,880
Wadatsumi!

243
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,350
He looks familiar.

244
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,020
He's the Sea Bonze who attacked
the Sunny! He works for Decken!

245
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,230
--I-It's the Great Monk!
--Wadatsumi!

246
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,200
Stop them!

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,280
I got it!

248
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,040
Second Gear!

249
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,460
Gum-Gum...

250
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,710
...Jet...

251
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,510
...Pistol!

252
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,480
My front tooth...

253
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,810
It cracked!

254
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,900
It hurts! It hurts!

255
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,900
He's good for nothing!

256
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Alright!

257
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,200
Coward, let's get to the Sea Forest!

258
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,120
Yes!

259
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,710
DRAGON

260
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,840
Boss Hordy! A pirate girl and a Mermaid
just exited the Ryugu Palace!

261
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,670
Who cares?

262
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,220
If I can get rid of him,

263
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,020
there will be only an old
fool and a mob to take care of!

264
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,150
Shark Arrows!

265
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,160
Nami-chin, was it okay to leave
Zoro-chin and the others behind?

266
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,620
We couldn't escape with everyone.

267
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,000
That's true, but...

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Don't worry! They always make it through!

269
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,380
I know they're all tough.

270
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,430
But Hatchin said that Hordy is not only
strong but has dangerous thoughts, too.

271
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,140
They've gotten much
stronger in last 2 years.

272
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,060
That aside, what kind of person
is Jimbei, the former Warlord?

273
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Huh?

274
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,320
Although he is a pirate,

275
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,910
people on the island trust him so he's
allowed to enter the Ryugu Palace.

276
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,000
I see. But he was in the same pirate
group with Arlong, wasn't he?

277
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,080
That guy--Hordy is a follower of Arlong.

278
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,460
Jimbei's message to Luffy was
"Don't fight against Hordy."

279
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,470
I know what he meant.

280
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,590
Isn't it because it's dangerous?

281
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,350
I hope Zoro and the others won't make
Hordy mad as they get more involved.

282
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,480
In any event, I wanna see Jimbei!

283
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,440
He'll be waiting for Luffy
at the Sea Forest, right?

284
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,650
The events happening now
have deep roots in history.

285
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,490
They could shake up the whole kingdom!

286
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,620
I think he knows everything
about what's going on.

287
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,410
Boss Jimbei does?

288
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,530
Camie.

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,250
Take me to the Sea Forest!

290
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,040
Uh-huh!

291
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,010
Listen, soldiers!

292
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,020
Yes, sir! We'll get rid of Hordy
and his crew immediately!

293
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,310
No-jamon!

294
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,610
Since I can't fight at full power,
you'd be sacrificing your lives for nothing.

295
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,740
We shall give up the palace for now and
meet up with Fukaboshi and the others

296
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,780
and wait for a chance to fight back!

297
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,870
Give up the palace?
Are you serious, Neptune-sama?!

298
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,790
Damn Zoro! He thinks he can
beat a Fish-Man in the water?

299
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,340
Usopp-san, I keep losing my
strength and I'm going to drown soon...

300
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,630
You're dead already.

301
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
That's true...

302
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,270
Are you starting to suffer?

303
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,480
Humans are so disadvantaged under water!

304
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,820
Zoro's gonna pass out!

305
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,580
Is that what Hordy's up to?

306
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,630
I'm passing out!

307
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,300
Zoro...

308
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,980
That swordsman's dead!

309
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,440
How stupid is he? Thinking that a human
can fight against a Fish-Man in the water!

310
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,570
What a pain in the ass. But this is it!

311
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,870
Drop dead, you lowly creature!

312
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,550
Zoro!

313
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,230
Boss!

314
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,690
One-Sword Style...

315
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,530
...Lion Strike!

316
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,550
Zoro's group must escape Ryugu Palace
before it fills with water,

317
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,250
but the Fish-Men take Energy
Steroids to enhance their strength

318
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,300
and gain the upper hand again.

319
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,060
Meanwhile, Luffy's group has finally
reached Jimbei in the Sea Forest

320
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,390
and he tells them of shocking past events
involving Nami and Arlong.

321
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,650
