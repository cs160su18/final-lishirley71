00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,100
This smell is...

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,580
It's him!

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,440
Huh?

24
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,910
Doctorine! There's a problem!

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,070
He's... Wapol is back!

26
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,160
Is that so...

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,910
Ahh! That bastard!

28
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,790
That annoying mouth!

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,520
Look! Everything is as it
used to be! This is my castle.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,180
We're restoring the Drum Kingdom!

31
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,350
Just a moment, Wapol-sama!
On top of the castle...

32
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,060
Hmm?

33
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,530
What's that strange flag?

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,110
What happened to the
Drum Kingdom's flag?!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
I burned that thing.

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,650
So you show yourself, Dr. Kureha!
The last survivor of the doctor hunt!

37
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,630
This castle is no longer yours!

38
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,420
This isn't a place for rotten brats like you!

39
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,130
Leave this country!
The Drum Kingdom has already died out!

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,840
What'd you say?!

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,470
Wait!

42
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,770
I'm gonna beat the crap outta him!

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,340
"Vs. Wapol's Corps!
The Power Of The Munch Munch Fruit!"

44
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,780
Gum-Gum...

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,040
W-Wapol-sama! It's Straw Hat!

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,570
Ah!

47
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,490
...Pistol!

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,290
--Wapol-sama!
--Wapol-sama!

49
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,740
That was close...

50
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,230
How dare you bastards...

51
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,650
Over and over again... How many
times do you have to be in our way?!

52
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,860
Hmm? Why are they here?

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,780
Ah!

54
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,090
Since I had someone injured with me then,
I ran, as there was no other choice.

55
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,950
But this time... I don't
have to hold back any more!

56
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,480
Hmm, you bastard!

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,820
How dare you suddenly attack Wapol-sama,
the king of the Drum Kingdom!

58
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,500
That's right! He's the king!

59
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,670
How dare you do such a
thing to his Excellency,

60
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,950
the most excellent ruler of all
the citizens on this island!

61
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,030
Who cares! You guys tick me off!

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,120
Hey young man. You know them?

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,870
Yeah, I do! He's that annoying mouth!
The annoying mouth pirate!

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,780
That annoying mouth?

65
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,300
He keeps getting in my way! He ate part
of our ship and attacked my friends!

66
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,110
I won't let him get away
with it any more!

67
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,300
Before that, aren't you
cold in that getup?

68
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,840
Huh?

69
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,100
See?

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,390
Didn't they say he was the king?
He isn't a pirate?!

71
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,510
That's what you just realized?!

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,760
Humph! What an idiot! It seems
he finally realized his rudeness.

73
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,480
Wapol-sama is the king
of the Drum Kingdom.

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,530
When he met you before, he was temporarily
a pirate for his own reasons. That's all.

75
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,480
He's done being a pirate

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,490
and is going back to being the king
of this castle and country.

77
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,320
Hey, this place is cold!

78
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,760
That's what I've been saying!

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,490
It's 50 degrees below, you know!

80
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,250
They're making light of us!

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,710
Wapol-sama!

82
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,050
I'm really mad now... Straw Hat!

83
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,170
I'll bite you off!

84
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,720
Um, could you hold on a minute?
Luffy went to get some clothes.

85
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
He's gone?!

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,220
Let me ask you a question.

87
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,190
He... stretched earlier... His arm...

88
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,120
Yeah, he stretches...
it's because he's a rubber man.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Wh... What's that?

90
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,070
It's a monster!

91
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,250
To sum up, the rebel old hag and some
of the Straw Hats are in this castle.

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,020
Once we eliminate all of them, there won't
be anyone else impudent enough to defy me.

93
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,780
Precisely.

94
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,000
This will become the bright day
of the Drum Kingdom's restoration.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,230
I'll start with you, Dr. Kureha!

96
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,220
You've got quite the nerve settling
in the castle during our absence...

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
and even flying a strange flag!

98
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,640
I made this castle Hiriluk's grave.

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,550
I wasn't really interested
in such a run-down castle,

100
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,940
but this reindeer insisted on
flying Hiriluk's flag up there.

101
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,410
I raised this skull towards
all the diseases!

102
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,490
Skull...

103
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,170
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible!

104
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,630
I will save this country as a doctor!

105
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,760
By raising this,
I'll fight just like pirates do!

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,760
Doctor fought to save this country...
by raising that flag...

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,650
Take me to the patients!
I came to save the Twenty MDs!

108
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,020
You still don't get it?!
It was a trap!

109
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,380
As you can see,
the Twenty MDs are just fine!

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,950
So that was all...

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,880
Good... So none of them are sick?

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,600
I was convinced...
that this was a national crisis...

113
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,680
So it was just a trick...

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,640
Hey... when do you think a person dies?

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,100
Doctor!!

116
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,890
When a bullet from a
pistol pierces his heart?

117
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,130
No... When he's attacked
by an incurable disease?

118
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,530
No... When he eats a deadly
poisonous mushroom soup?

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,510
No!

120
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,420
A man dies when people forget him...

121
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,390
Even if I disappear,
my dream will come true.

122
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,250
The citizens' sickness of the
heart will be cured as well...

123
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,730
Why're you crying... Dalton-kun?

124
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,640
I wonder... if it's
the same for a country...

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,610
Yeah, if there's someone
to pass it on to...

126
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,740
Don't worry, Chopper.
Your mushroom can't kill me.

127
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,210
I had... such a good life!

128
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,750
Good-bye, quack...

129
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,900
Thank you, Chopper!

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,330
This castle is where Doctor died...

131
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,490
He died trying...
to save this country...

132
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,210
So this place is...
this place is Doctor's grave!

133
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,650
Grave?! That stupid doctor's?!

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,100
How dare you violate my sacred castle
with that scum doctor's flag!

135
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,060
Burn down that flag already!

136
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,360
I won't let you make it
inside this castle...

137
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,690
Hmm?!

138
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,540
Never!

139
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,420
Wapol-sama... he is...

140
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,990
That's right! From that time...

141
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,540
The monster...
that followed the stupid doctor!

142
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,670
That flag... is Doctor's faith!

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,630
So I won't let you take it down!

144
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,960
Never!

145
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,350
Show them no mercy!
We're going into the castle!

146
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,430
Take down every single one of them!

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,140
Are you gonna fight, too, old lady?

148
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Old lady?

149
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,100
Ugh!

150
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,040
If they're more than you guys
can handle, I'll give you a hand.

151
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,060
Appreciate that...

152
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,170
Wapol-sama! Please leave them to us!

153
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,690
We'll clean up the small fries right away!

154
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,700
Doctorine!

155
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,160
Hey hey hey, you with the afro.

156
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,580
What kind of brother are you,
throwing an afro at a lady?

157
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,090
Hey, you're getting it now.

158
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,710
You fell for it...

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,550
Huh?

160
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,010
Ah! What?! I can't shake it off!

161
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,890
What's this afro?! Static electricity?!

162
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Exactly!

163
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,230
Ahh! Dammit! Come off! Dammit!

164
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,540
Ohhhhh... it's cold! It's cold!

165
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,720
Clothes! Clothes!

166
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,300
Clothes! Clothes! Clothes!

167
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,260
Where're the clothes?!

168
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,950
What's going on outside?
It seems noisy...

169
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,590
It's cold outside! Where're my clothes?

170
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,830
I didn't ask that. I asked
what was happening outside.

171
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,480
Ahh, it's a fight.

172
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,510
I see... You guys're okay, right?

173
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,040
Yeah, so stay in bed.

174
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,050
You can use my clothes.

175
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,660
What? Your clothes're ugly.

176
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,360
They're cooler than yours.

177
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,680
Really? Well, I guess it's
all right if they're warm.

178
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,150
Alrighty!

179
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,180
Oh... I wondered what
the fuss was about...

180
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,060
That bastard! I'll beat up
that annoying mouth!

181
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,060
Dammit!

182
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,250
What's with this afro? It doesn't
come off! It doesn't come off!

183
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,860
There're lots more coming!

184
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,340
Marimo's Static Cling!

185
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,000
What the hell are these things?!
They're damn gross!

186
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,080
Hey, reindeer! Don't just watch! Help me!

187
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,060
Okay!

188
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,950
Take these off quick!
They're really gross!

189
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,690
On top of that, they're plain! Too plain!

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Ahh! They're now stuck on me!
I'm giving them back to you!

191
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,480
Ah! Don't give them back to me!
Keep at least one!

192
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
No! They're gross!

193
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,220
They're gross to me, too!

194
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,620
Stop it!
Don't give them to me!

195
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,990
--What the heck are you guys doing?

196
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,030
--Ahh! Stop it!
--What the heck are you guys doing?

197
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,520
Humph! They know nothing about teamwork.

198
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,690
I'll tell you one thing.

199
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,000
Despite their plain look,
those Static Marimos burn flashily.

200
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,050
Hmm?! Oh no!
He's going to burn these afros!

201
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,730
Here you go!

202
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay... Hey! Where're you going?!

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,140
Decoy plan!

204
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,760
D-Decoy plan? Am I the decoy?!

205
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,390
Check mate!

206
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,810
Ah! Ow! Ow! Snow! Snow! Snow!

207
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,850
Move!

208
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,520
Wapol-sama!

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,230
Darn it!

210
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,860
Chopper!

211
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,570
Whoa... This is really warm!

212
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,360
Luffy!

213
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,790
Huh?

214
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,330
Grab my leg from there!

215
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,570
Your leg? Sure!

216
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,330
Like this?

217
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,220
Okay then! Don't let your hands go!

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,290
Hmm? Got it!

219
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,790
Armée de l'Air Assault... Gum Shoot!

220
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
That was okay I guess...

221
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,130
Th... Thank you. You guys're amazing...

222
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,570
Ah! Hey Luffy! You jerk!
Isn't that Nami-san's jacket?!

223
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,040
Yeah... Look! He's still alive,
though the hippo flew away.

224
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,710
Take it off! You jerk!

225
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,750
Wapol-sama, are you all right?

226
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,670
They're stronger than we thought.
We underestimated them!

227
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,640
I can no longer let them live!
Those bastards!

228
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,030
What?!

229
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll show them... the true power
of the Munch Munch Fruit!

230
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,140
Wapol-sama!

231
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,230
I'll show them... Munch Munch Factory!

232
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,750
Oh, he stood up!

233
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,670
Would a normal person stand
up after taking that attack?

234
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,450
His body's made tough!

235
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,520
Chess! Call out what I ate today!

236
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,260
Yes sir!

237
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,290
Well... you ate one butter-sautéed
cannon and one raw cannon on the ship.

238
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,050
Also cannonball and gunpowder salad as
well as a toasted house in the village.

239
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,960
What kind of stuff do you eat?!

240
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,760
When it comes to omnivores,
this guy takes the cake.

241
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,290
Wait and see... Food soon
becomes my blood and flesh...

242
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,690
He's gonna do something!

243
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,640
Huh?

244
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,690
What's that?

245
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,530
Munch Munch Shock!

246
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,340
Wapol House!

247
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,760
A house?!

248
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,370
Sweet!

249
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,830
It's too soon to be surprised.
Now this is the king's technique!

250
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,540
--Ahh!
--Ahh!

251
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,710
Munch Munch Factory!

252
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,420
Ahh!

253
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,120
--Ahhhh!
--Ahhhh!

254
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,590
What the...

255
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,400
H... He's eating his own men!

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,010
He's eating his own people!

257
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,190
He stopped moving...

258
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,750
Feast your eyes on this!
Come out, miraculous union!

259
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,700
--Huh?!
--What?! Union?!

260
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,340
I am the strongest warrior
of the Drum Kingdom...

261
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,520
Chessmarimo!

262
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,470
Well... isn't that just one
riding on the other's shoulders?

263
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,310
Sweet!

264
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,650
What's sweet about it?!

265
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,130
Don't let your guard down.

266
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,860
Hmm?

267
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,270
If they were really weak,
a stupid act like exiling doctors...

268
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,830
would've been stopped by the citizens.

269
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,570
The Drum Kingdom's Constitution, Article 1!

270
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,880
"Those who don't do as the
king wishes should die."

271
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,010
That sums up this country!

272
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,190
It's because this country is my country...
and this castle is my castle.

273
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,600
Of all the flags,
don't fly that quack's flag!

274
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,860
It will ruin the castle!

275
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,550
A pirate flag...
Hey, reindeer. That flag...

276
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,070
Nothing is impossible for the man
who raised a flag with a skull!

277
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,420
That's what I told you, right, Chopper?!

278
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,660
You bastard... you attacked Doctor's flag!

279
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,410
Doctor... tried to save even you!

280
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,530
Chopper...

281
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,880
Don't hold a grudge against humans.

282
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,680
This country is sick right now.

283
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,090
The king also suffers from
a sickness of the heart.

284
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,470
Hmm?

285
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,690
Why? Doctor, a guy like
him isn't worth saving!

286
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,820
Hmm?

287
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:49,250
I... I won't hit you...
so leave this country!

288
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,420
What're you saying, Chopper?!
You think he'll just listen to you?!

289
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,920
But... after all...

290
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,590
Humph!

291
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,090
Ah!

292
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,720
Chopper!

293
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,680
Hey, annoying mouth!

294
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,310
Huh?!

295
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,270
Straw Hat!

296
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,520
You were a fake pirate, right?

297
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,440
You don't know what
this pirate flag means

298
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,660
because you were fake pirates
who didn't even risk your lives!

299
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,420
That guy...

300
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,710
What that flag means, Straw Hat?

301
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,610
Stupid pirate flags have no meaning!

302
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,820
That's why you're hopeless!

303
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,830
What'd you say?!

304
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,800
A pirate flag isn't something
that you can raise as a joke!

305
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,650
What an idiot! If it weren't for a joke,
there's no way I, the king, would raise it!

306
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,270
Don't put that stupid flag
back up when I take it down!

307
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,020
Dodge it! Watch out!

308
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,190
You can't break this flag!

309
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,000
Luffy!

310
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,730
It's a direct hit!

311
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,560
He must've been blown away!
Such an idiot!

312
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,900
See? It didn't break...

313
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,090
C... Can't be! He's stupid!

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,300
I don't know who the heck
this pirate flag belongs to...

315
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,060
but since this flag is a person's
pledge to risk his life...

316
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,510
it's not raised as a joke!

317
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,440
This flag isn't something you can
just break while laughing foolishly!

318
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,540
Incredible...

319
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,300
So this is... a pirate!

320
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,150
It won't break... Never...

321
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,510
The skull is a mark of faith!

322
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:24,170
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

323
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:36,910
From today forth,
something's going to change

324
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:46,620
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

325
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:57,360
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

326
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:08,110
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

327
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:16,460
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

328
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,120
Before dawn

329
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,710
That reindeer is amazing.
He transforms one form after another!

330
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,980
He can really jump.

331
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,720
A beam's next! He's gonna shoot a beam!

332
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,420
He won't, you idiot! H-hey, hold on a sec!

333
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,650
Where did that tin bastard go?

334
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,680
What? He's not here!
When on earth did he...

335
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,650
While you were fascinated by
the transformations, of course!

336
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,500
Where're you, annoying mouth?!

337
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

338
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,130
"Zoan-Type Devil Fruit!
Chopper's Seven-Form Transformation"

339
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
