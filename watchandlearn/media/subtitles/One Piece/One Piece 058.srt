00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,490
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,030
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,940
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,520
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,170
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,070
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,580
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,590
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,090
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:21,010
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,310
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:31,320
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,450
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,460
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,540
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,880
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,320
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,970
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,530
Awesome! Nami! Check it out!

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
The pirate ship!

23
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,140
Hey! I see an island below that light!

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,630
We're going to land there!

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,970
Why've you not reported to me after
finding the Millennial Dragon?!

26
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,640
Our main forces will now
head for Warship Island!

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,460
All ships, move out!

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,100
Stupid Nami makes the
men do all the work...

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,660
Hey, you! Less complaining
and more pushing!

30
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,850
Don't start getting cocky, you!

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,200
Finally made it...

32
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,870
We're alive... right?

33
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,600
Yeah, it seems that way...

34
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,680
What's that?

35
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,860
What is this?

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,110
"Showdown in the Ruins!
Tense Zoro vs. Eric!"

37
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,790
Wow! What a huge picture!

38
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,180
What's it of?

39
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,970
It looks like some
sort of map... Oww...

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,120
But it's too worn out
to make any sense of.

41
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,190
But what is this place, anyways?!

42
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,020
Wasn't this supposed
to be the dragons' nest?

43
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,140
Dunno.

44
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,840
Well, Apis?

45
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,090
I don't know.

46
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,810
Grandpa Ryu says he doesn't
know what this place is, either...

47
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,630
Man! He's always just a useless old guy!

48
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,810
He's what?!

49
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,450
But it's the truth!

50
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,170
Then how exactly are you being useful?!

51
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,030
Me?!

52
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,790
Hey, guys! Look at this!

53
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,000
The ceiling picture's fallen down!

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,450
Yikes!

55
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,340
It's huge!

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,120
Whoa, talk about dangerous!

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,610
This whole building's ready to fall apart!

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,200
If we dilly-dally around here,
we'll be in danger, too!

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,130
Let's get the heck outta this place!

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,530
But this might be the dragons' nest!

61
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,700
I don't see any dragons
around here, do you?!

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,840
Hold on a second!

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,210
What is it, Nami-san?

64
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,000
This might not be Lost Island...

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,570
See!

66
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,400
You don't even know the reason why!
Quit making stuff up!

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,150
How can you tell that, Nami?

68
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,480
Look up.

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Up?

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,980
At the ceiling picture?

71
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,160
Look closely.

72
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,740
It's a map that marks
the location of Lost Island.

73
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,710
That island with a
dome-shaped building on it...

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,710
That's this island.

75
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,260
That dome is this building.

76
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,170
It does look just like it...

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,880
And the people around the island
are the people who once lived here.

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,070
I'd wager they're probably Apis' ancestors.

79
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,680
Our ancestors?

80
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,820
Say, do you remember what
old man Bokuden told us?

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,180
Nope! I was asleep!

82
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,460
Come on, now! He said
the people of Warship Island

83
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,410
had traveled there from another island.

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,980
He did?

85
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,800
Come to think of it,
he did say something like that...

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
Then does that mean the dynasty
he kept blabbing on about

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,580
was on this island?

88
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,040
Probably.

89
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,900
So what had me wondering

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,580
were all the dragon statues
and paintings on the way here.

91
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,010
I think they might've been used
by the people living on this island

92
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,870
to worship the Millennial Dragon as a god.

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,440
I bet the Millennial Dragon used
to fly over this island long ago.

94
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,790
I see!

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,570
That would lower the chance of the
dragons' nest being on this island.

96
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,610
But...! If so, then where's the real one?!

97
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,150
Wouldn't it be that island
with the dragon drawn on it?

98
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,240
That's right!

99
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,960
There's an island ahead of where
this island's people are praying.

100
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,850
That's the real Lost Island!

101
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,200
The dragons' nest must be there, too!

102
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,340
But...

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,330
Wait a minute!
That island is shaped like...!

104
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,390
Yeah.

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,090
Assuming the map is correct,

106
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,300
the dragons' nest is on Warship Island.

107
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,150
But I thought there were no places
on Warship Island that fit the bill?!

108
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,010
But that's what the map says!

109
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,990
Or are you saying the people
long ago just drew random nonsense?!

110
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,530
Yeah, you guys!

111
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,960
Nami-san'd never say
anything that's wrong!

112
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,760
This means it's somewhere on that island!

113
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,530
We'll figure it out if we go check it out!

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,040
But... It could also have sunk
to the bottom of the ocean...

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,990
No, that's actually much more likely.

116
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,140
That would explain why
nobody's ever found it yet.

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,460
Apis?

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,130
Grandpa Ryu!

119
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,100
Think back, Grandpa Ryu!
Where is the dragons' nest?!

120
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,500
We thought it was this place,
but there's nothing here!

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,680
There's only a painting, Grandpa Ryu!

122
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,180
Does the painting bring
back any memories?!

123
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,010
Our only hope now is that you
remember something, Grandpa Ryu!

124
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,700
Come on! Please!
Remember, Grandpa Ryu!

125
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,190
Grandpa Ryu!

126
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,530
Alright! So the dragons' nest
really is on Warship Island, then?!

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,070
Eh?! How did you know
what he said, Luffy?!

128
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,500
I just did!

129
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,500
You're right.
Grandpa Ryu said he remembered!

130
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,580
He says the dragons' nest

131
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,160
is on an island east of a peak
that looks like a warship...

132
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,380
Man! Why does he say that

133
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,200
only after we went through
all that hardship to get here?!

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm sorry...

135
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,010
I'm sorry for dragging
you all the way out here

136
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,410
for something that might've
already sunk into the ocean...

137
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,330
It was all for nothing...

138
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,880
Not necessarily!

139
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,120
Who knows? The dragons' nest
could be somewhere unexpected!

140
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,660
And there's no telling for sure
without checking it out, right?!

141
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,040
That's right!

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,620
Being discouraged this
easily isn't like you, Apis!

143
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,700
You'll never get anything done
if you're afraid of failure.

144
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,040
There's nothing wrong with
living a roundabout life...

145
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,300
Everyone...

146
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,970
So, let's go! Grandpa Ryu won't
get any better if we just stay here!

147
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,010
Right?!

148
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,170
Yeah!

149
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,740
Thank you!

150
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,810
Is something wrong, Zoro?!

151
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,690
Someone's here.

152
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,500
With bloodlust.

153
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,490
Thanks for the explanation.

154
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,700
Now I know where to find
Dragonite and the dragons' nest...

155
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,170
You again?!

156
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,560
But there's no point if it's
at the bottom of the ocean...

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
So it would seem my only option
is to take your Millennial Dragon.

158
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,700
No!

159
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,340
Besides, we don't know if their
nest is on the ocean bottom or not!

160
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,350
He said he had Sickle-Sickle
Fruit powers, if I recall...

161
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,920
That's one nasty guy we got here...

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,070
Sickle-Sickle Fruit?!
He has Devil Fruit powers?!

163
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,610
Hey...

164
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,800
Luffy.

165
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,570
You go on ahead and take
Grandpa Ryu to the ship!

166
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,740
I'll catch up with you later.

167
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,120
Got it!

168
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,080
W-W-Whoa, now! The ship?!

169
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,730
We don't even know
where the exit here is!

170
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,920
Then we can just... make one!

171
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,080
You're not seriously gonna--!

172
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,650
Huh? I thought that would
bust it open, but...

173
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,560
Oh, geez...

174
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,730
It's open! It's open!

175
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,660
It worked out! It worked out!

176
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,220
Let's go, Apis!

177
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,010
He's less than a caveman...

178
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,760
Oh, no, you don't!

179
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,920
Dammit, Luffy! Get going already!

180
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,320
Oh! My bad!

181
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,260
So fast! So fast!

182
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,920
W-We always make it out alive, don't we?!

183
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,640
It's not for certain that we'll
live through this! That idiot!

184
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,610
This makes going back a cinch!

185
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,460
Damn you! Get in my way
and you'll pay!

186
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,470
So let's see how you plan
on making me pay!

187
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm pretty confident that right now

188
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
we're the fastest moving
things in this world!

189
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,080
What kind of thing is that to brag about?!

190
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,570
Luffy! Do something!

191
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,870
We're gonna wind up in pieces
before we get to the ship!

192
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,250
It's okay! It's okay!

193
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,430
How are we okay?!

194
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,930
Sickle-Sickle Wind Slash!

195
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,400
What was that?!

196
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,620
You can't run away from me!

197
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,090
I have no time to be playing with you.

198
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,590
My only goal is that Millennial Dragon!

199
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,360
Get back here!

200
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,170
Are they alright?!

201
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,380
Hey! Will Zoro really be alright?!

202
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,220
Yeah! He'll be fine!

203
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,720
But he's up against a guy
with Devil Fruit powers!

204
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,850
He doesn't stand a chance,
no matter how strong he is!

205
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,500
He'll still be alright!

206
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,940
Luffy! Ahead! Ahead!

207
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,930
This isn't good...

208
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,400
Don't give us that!

209
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,350
Do something!

210
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
Over there, eh?

211
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,220
Sorry. I can't let you pass here.

212
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,180
Whatever. It's up to me
whether I pass or not!

213
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,910
Out of the way!

214
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,700
Damn! That nimble bastard!

215
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,050
I told you I'm not letting you pass.

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,700
Just stay right there!

217
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,500
Luffy! There's another dead-end!

218
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,020
Wanna bust it down?

219
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,000
No!

220
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm pretty sure that up ahead is
the cliff we followed on our way up!

221
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,750
If we do that, we'll fall over it
head-first and then we're goners!

222
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,550
Think we can fly?

223
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,880
No!

224
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,800
I told you not to get in my way!

225
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,750
Now die like a good little boy!

226
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,970
It looks like we somehow
managed to make it...

227
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,670
Man, we seriously have
incredible luck or something...

228
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,470
Alright! We made it, right?

229
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,430
Get ready to set sail! Let's go!

230
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,760
No more, please...

231
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,170
Damn bastard...

232
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,440
You're totally... gonna pay!

233
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,580
Luffy!

234
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,450
He says... He says Zoro's in trouble!

235
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,620
What do we do?! We gotta help him!

236
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,770
Die!

237
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,800
Zoro!

238
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,740
Bingo!

239
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,140
Awesome!

240
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,100
No, not this pattern...

241
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,850
Here we go!

242
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,420
I told you to stop doing this!

243
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,530
Oh. My bad.

244
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,860
I swear, someday
I will chop this guy up!

245
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,120
Damn!

246
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,100
I refuse to let you escape me!

247
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,420
We're out! We're out!

248
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,550
That's definitely weird...

249
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,340
What?! They did?!

250
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,100
Yes, sir! They're on their
way to Warship Island again,

251
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,300
with the Millennial Dragon in tow!

252
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,180
Then make chase the moment
we're ready! On the double!

253
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,030
Y-Yes, sir! A-And one other
thing, Lt. Commander!

254
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,980
While in pursuit of them,
Eric-sama also reappeared

255
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,620
and has just returned to ship!

256
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,390
What a bunch of useless clods.

257
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,240
We should just sink the lot of 'em...

258
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Sir?

259
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,570
Nothing! Thank you for the report!

260
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,180
I'm glad to see you've
returned to the ship unharmed.

261
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,920
Did you get the Dragonite?

262
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,040
If you have time for sarcastic remarks,
then go after them already!

263
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,340
Look at 'em come! Look at 'em come!

264
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,780
They'll never catch up with us!

265
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,360
The Going Merry is faster and
more agile than bulky Navy warships,

266
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,100
but what are we going to do
when we get to Warship Island?!

267
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,110
--We'll be okay!
--How will we be okay?!

268
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,300
We just need to find
the dragons' nest first

269
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,580
so Grandpa Ryu can get better, right?!

270
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,520
Easier said than done!

271
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,270
Their nest could be
at the bottom of the ocean!

272
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,540
We just need to search the
bottom of the ocean then!

273
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,540
That's big talk for
someone who can't swim...

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,820
Anyways, we need to get back
as fast as we can!

275
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,120
We don't have time to be
messing with the navy!

276
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,550
Nami-san. It doesn't look like
that's going to be an option...

277
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,120
Wow! Cool!

278
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,030
It's like a gargoyle!

279
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,770
Hey, now!

280
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,500
The small fries have leapt forth...

281
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,090
Now is the time!

282
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,420
Open to the left and right!
Crane Wing Formation!

283
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,230
Is this for reals?!

284
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,810
Just how many ships
does the damn navy have?!

285
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,230
Listen, now!

286
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,270
Connect all ships by chain links
to create a complete wall

287
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,740
that won't allow even a
single small fry to escape!

288
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,820
What now?! They have us blocked off!

289
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,000
Jump onto a ship, kick the guys off,
and cut the links!

290
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,650
That's the only choice, obviously!

291
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,920
Wow! You can do that, Usopp?!

292
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,130
Go! Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

293
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,670
I thought as much.

294
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,380
Doesn't sound too bad to me, though!

295
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,720
Eh?! But, are you serious?!

296
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,470
There's no way you could
survive if you tried that!

297
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,250
It's okay, Apis. Things'll work out.

298
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,350
But make it quick, you guys!

299
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,190
You can count on me, Nami-san!

300
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,560
Alright! Let's go!

301
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,850
All ships, take aim!
The target is the pirate ship!

302
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,770
But do not hit the raft behind the ship!

303
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,380
It must not be damaged
in even the slightest!

304
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,690
Stop the ships.

305
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,040
All ships, full stop!

306
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,530
Nelson Royal...

307
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,490
I had you pegged as a fatty
who can do nothing but eat,

308
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,370
but when you're on the sea,
it's as if you've been reborn...

309
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,480
A mere commodore,
but a commodore nonetheless, huh?

310
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
This feels great!

311
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,030
Alright!

312
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,650
Let's go!

313
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,040
My overflowing feelings don't connect

314
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,880
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

315
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll set off by myself,

316
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,720
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

317
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,520
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

318
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,610
Why is it so hot?

319
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:55,620
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

320
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,910
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

321
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,670
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

322
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,430
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

323
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,840
With you, I can run there

324
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,940
Ah! We're done for!

325
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,480
They're gonna take us down!

326
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,450
Who the hell thought
of this plan anyway?!

327
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,620
It was you!!

328
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,950
The ride's about to get rough!
Hang on to something!

329
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,250
Alright, Nami-san!

330
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,920
Oh, that round is gonna hit us.

331
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,830
Quit your blabbing and do something!

332
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,170
Yo, I'm on it!

333
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,210
"Luffy, Completely Surrounded!
Commodore Nelson's Secret Strategy"

335
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
