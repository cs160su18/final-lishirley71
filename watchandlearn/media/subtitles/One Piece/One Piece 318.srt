00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,930
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,280
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,420
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,480
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,160
Don't be ridiculous!

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,120
You think you can buy a real sword
for that paltry amount of money?!

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,470
Oh, well...

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,140
If you're not gonna buy anything, scram!

38
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,560
Geez...

39
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,750
At any rate...

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,520
If I remember right, they're...

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,270
Please go on ahead!

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, really...

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,250
We're sorry that we tried to extort you!

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,530
Well, don't worry about it!
Thanks for showing me the way! Later!

45
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
...the brats who showed me the way that time.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,290
Zoro-san! Zoro-san!

47
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,500
Please be our big brother!

48
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,050
Huh?!

49
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,540
"Mothers Are Strong!
Zoro's Hectic Household Chores!"

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,080
--I refuse.
--What?! Really?!

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,190
Why do I have to become a
big brother to brats like you?

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,640
Now, now, don't be like that.

53
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,850
Having seen you beat marines,
we've taken quite a liking to you!

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,780
Oh, I'm Michael. Glad to see you again.

55
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm Hoichael.

56
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,950
Around the backstreets,
we brothers are a bit famous for...

57
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,750
You should hear people out!

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,750
Bro, we'll take you wherever you wanna go.

59
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,800
Wanna go buy some meat?
How about vegetables?

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,070
--I refuse.
--You refuse? Refuse what?

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,380
Both becoming your big brother
and having you show me the way.

62
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,020
Get lost already.

63
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh, yeah, that's right!
Bro, you're looking to buy a sword, right?

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,310
The sword shop owner turned me down earlier,
since I don't have much money.

65
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,990
Then you should go to a secondhand store.
I bet you'll find quite a bargain!

66
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,980
Yep! We'll show our big brother
the way to the secondhand store!

67
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,940
I guess it couldn't hurt.

68
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,730
But let me just point out that I'm not
agreeing to become your big brother.

69
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,210
Yes, sir, Bro!

70
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,320
Now, make way, make way!

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,500
Pirate Hunter Zoro-sama coming through!

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,160
Cut that out!

73
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,020
They're skipping school
and wandering about again.

74
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,840
They're gonna grow up to be
good-for-nothings. What ungrateful kids...

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,830
Well, at their home,
it's rather the mother that's...

76
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,360
I feel sorry for those kids.

77
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,990
So no luck here, either.

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,290
Hey, what're you looking at?!

79
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,000
That's rude to Big Bro Zoro!

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey, isn't that swordsman who's with them

81
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,670
one of the pirates who saved Iceberg-san?

82
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,130
What the heck? I thought he was a hero.

83
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,300
So he's just a punk? I misjudged him.

84
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,770
You guys have got quite a reputation.

85
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,670
The townspeople are clueless.

86
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,940
They can say whatever they
want about us. We don't care.

87
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,570
Oh, yeah? Good for you, then.

88
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,970
Well then, take care.

89
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,230
Wh-What do you mean?

90
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,400
Are you abandoning your dear little brothers?!

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,830
Like I said, I don't remember
becoming your big brother!

92
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,600
Oh? Did you say something?

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,490
We can't hear anything.

94
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,250
Whoa! What the hell is that?!

95
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,930
What is it?! What is it?!

96
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,370
All right, I shook them off.

97
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,470
Bro!

98
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,100
What?!

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,780
Bro!

100
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,860
Bro!

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
Bro!

102
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,210
Bro! Bro! Bro!

103
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,650
Bro!

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,210
We know this town like the back of our hands.

105
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,350
There's no way you can get away from us.

106
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,400
Shut up! Stop mocking me, you brats!

107
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,050
That's harsh, Bro!

108
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,110
Don't call me "Bro"!

109
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,500
Who the hell are you?

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
Just what do you think
you're doing, hitting my kids?

111
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,200
"My kids"? Then...

112
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,670
What strength! What's with this woman?!

113
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,950
Oh? Not bad, lad.

114
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,810
Then... Special Attack! Bam-Bam Tornado!

115
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,570
Stop it, Mom! He didn't do anything wrong!

116
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,980
It was all our fault!

117
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,190
You guys were misbehaving again?! You idiots!

118
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,400
Ow!

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,740
Sorry about that.

120
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,180
But I guess it's okay, right,
since you became their big brother?

121
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,700
No, I didn't.

122
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,690
You guys, come out and say hello.

123
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,870
I'm Yoko.

124
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,130
I'm Yuuya.

125
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,270
--I'm Shou.
--I'm Ayako.

126
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm Akihiro.

127
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,790
Guys, this is Big Bro Zoro!

128
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,790
He's our new oldest brother!

129
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,180
Oldest brother...? Don't tell me you
want me to be your big brother for real?

130
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,460
Come with us. We're behind
with our household chores,

131
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,140
since we've had to spend a lot of time
repairing our house after Aqua Laguna.

132
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,740
Huh?!

133
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,870
Bro! Bro!

134
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,080
Hey, wait! I didn't agree to this!
Let go of me! Hey!

135
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
Now, let's go home, kids!

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,450
Yeah!

137
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,290
By the way, what's that?

138
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,140
When Mom is out working,
we go pick up scrap wood at the harbor

139
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,980
while we're babysitting our siblings,

140
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,860
and once we get enough wood,
we go sell it to Galley-La on the weekend.

141
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,020
We can make quite a bit of
allowance money that way.

142
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,490
Well then, say goodbye to your mom for me.

143
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,990
Are you really leaving?

144
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,550
Sorry, but this has nothing to do with me, so...

145
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,060
Watch out!

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,150
--Geez...
--Nice babysitting!

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,990
Bro!

148
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,900
Not bad at all.

149
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,000
Just as I thought, you're good with babies!

150
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,460
Whoa! He wet himself!

151
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,360
Give him to me.

152
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,430
Go change his diaper.

153
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:18,970
Okay!

154
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,100
H-Hey! What're you doing?!
What are you, a perv?!

155
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,680
We're gonna wash it. Wear this until it's dried.

156
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,060
Wh-What the hell is this?!

157
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,340
Take care of him, okay?

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,490
Okay, kids! Let's work hard
and clean up the house!

159
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,890
Yeah!

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,410
Hey, Hoichael. Sorry, but I...

161
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
Hey, hey... Hey!

162
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Stop it!

163
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,260
Hey, Michael! Do something about these...

164
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,970
Stop!

165
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,540
Hey! Where do I put these...

166
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,340
You're quite a natural at this. Keep it up.

167
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,970
Okay, be good, you guys.

168
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,470
Hey, lady. I'm going back now.
Give me my shirt back.

169
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,630
What're you talking about?

170
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,650
Do you even have a place to
go back to besides this house?

171
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,640
Yeah. My friends are waiting for me.

172
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,110
How stupid! Friends or family--
which one's more important?

173
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,190
I'm not your family. I don't
remember you giving birth to me,

174
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,700
and we're not blood-related, either.

175
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,800
Shut up! The hell with blood relationships!

176
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,830
Are blood relationships that important?!

177
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,130
We're gonna settle this today for sure.

178
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,710
Get lost.

179
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,290
I came here yesterday and the day before,
but you didn't pay us back, you bitch!

180
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,940
Hm? Who are you?

181
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,980
I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.
Another new family member?

182
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,400
--That's right.
--No.
--Which is it?!

183
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
I guess it doesn't matter.

184
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,270
Anyway, it's not like you're
Paulie from Galley-La.

185
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,070
Quit dragging your feet
and pay us back, you old hag!

186
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,360
Like I told you before, I already
paid back what I borrowed!

187
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,090
You fool. Debts come with interest.

188
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,560
That interest also accrued more interest,

189
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,950
so it's now several dozen times more
than the amount you borrowed!

190
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,740
That's none of my concern.
Why don't you pay it yourself?!

191
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,720
What'd you say, you damn old hag?!

192
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,520
I'm not telling you to suffer all by yourself.

193
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,710
If you work those brats hard,
you can earn money easily.

194
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,670
They're not your real family anyway, right?

195
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,880
What'd you say?!

196
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,020
Hm?

197
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,930
Come to think of it...

198
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,600
...they don't look alike at all.

199
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,730
That hurt! What're you doing, you old hag?!

200
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,630
Just say that one more time,
and I'll blow your head off!

201
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,490
Get her!

202
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,970
Well... I'll let you off the hook for today.

203
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,210
Guys, let's go!

204
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,860
You won't get away with this!

205
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,130
--Cool!
--Just as we'd expect from you, bro!

206
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,060
Good boy. Mom's proud of you.

207
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,750
--"Good boy"...?
--Okay, kids!

208
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,610
Let's go shopping for dinner, shall we?!

209
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,580
Yeah!

210
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,660
Well then, I'll get going now.

211
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,100
Hurry up. You're coming, too.

212
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,190
You got a job for me?

213
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,060
Pops, knock the price down a bit more!

214
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Who do you think you're dealing with?!
Don't take us lightly!

215
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,650
Knock it off.

216
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,820
Dammit! However you look at it,
this doesn't make sense.

217
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,770
Why do I have to do things like this?!

218
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,980
If they see me like this...

219
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,780
Shoot!

220
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,790
Of all people, it had to be that damn cook...!

221
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,500
So that alley over there is a shortcut? Thanks.

222
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,090
Seriously...

223
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,180
Now that I've come this far...

224
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,530
Seriously... I'm exhausted.

225
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,360
Seems like you're having a rough time.

226
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,490
Yeah, tell me about it.
How could this be happening to...

227
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,730
It's you?!

228
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,410
--Dammit!
--Robin!

229
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,120
Huh? Where did she go?

230
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,830
Robin!

231
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,720
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

232
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Oh, and... that look suits you.

233
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,170
I've had enough! I'm going back!

234
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,520
Oh? You're going home ahead of us?

235
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,770
Then I'll give you the key to the house.
Clean the restroom or something.

236
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,910
No! I'm not going back to your house!
I'm going back to my friends!

237
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,750
Don't speak nonsense!

238
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,580
You're the one who's speaking nonsense!

239
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,730
Don't speak like that to your mother!

240
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,010
You're not my mother!

241
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,100
Shut up, you Broccoli Head!

242
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,140
It's not Broccoli Head! It's Moss Head!

243
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,830
Ah, Moss Head...

244
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,280
I see, Moss Head.

245
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,640
Yep, yep.

246
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,090
Right? Hey, no! That's not what I meant!

247
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,450
Well then, bye.

248
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,860
What am I gonna do with my oldest son?

249
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,540
Michael, Hoichael. Go get him later.

250
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,490
Okay!

251
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,820
Well then, let's go home.

252
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay!

253
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,090
Sorry about earlier.

254
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:05,720
Looks like your bodyguard is gone,
so I'd like to continue our discussion.

255
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,830
Could you come with me for a bit?

256
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,350
Hoichael, go get Bro.
I bet they'll take us to that place.

257
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,210
Okay.

258
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm not your family. I don't
remember you giving birth to me,

259
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,090
and we're not blood-related, either.

260
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,910
Shut up! The hell with blood relationships!

261
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,660
Are blood relationships that important?!

262
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,880
Bro!

263
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,590
Bro, there's trouble!

264
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,550
The debt collector took our mom away!

265
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,520
Sorry, but it has nothing to do with me.
And that lady can take care of herself.

266
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,320
But this time, he brought a bunch of his buddies

267
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,550
and took Michael and my siblings away, too!

268
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,610
What?!

269
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,960
You sure got cocky with me before.

270
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,280
As thanks for that, I brought
some scary guys with me.

271
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,540
Don't be scared out of your wits!

272
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,170
Sir! Please come here!

273
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,460
This is the captain of the
Big Helmet Pirate Gang, Mikazuki-san.

274
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,150
He's got a 36-million-Berry bounty on his head.

275
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,730
Kids, stay back. Don't do anything, got that?

276
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,320
Ahem.

277
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,710
Mikazuki-san has a vicious past.
He tried to walk out of Dock #1

278
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,160
at Galley-La without paying
for the repair of his ship...

279
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,050
...although he was regrettably
defeated by Galley-La's foremen.

280
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,220
Hence, in order to earn money for the repairs,

281
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,750
he's been earnestly working
part-time at our company and...

282
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,430
Well, you guys, think hard...

283
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,960
...about which is better--hurrying up
and paying so you can survive,

284
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,340
or defying me and becoming prey for my sword.

285
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,850
I'll give you five seconds to think it over.

286
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,780
Oh? You wanna fight with me,
the great Mikazuki-sama?

287
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,270
What a fool. As mentioned already,
my bounty is 36 million Berries, and...

288
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,230
Bang-Bang Tornado!

289
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,860
Go, Mom!

290
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,150
An attack like that won't work on me!

291
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,560
Do you know where they took them to?

292
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,620
They always take people to the
same place. We've seen it before.

293
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Dammit!

294
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,590
Don't take a man with a
36-million bounty lightly!

295
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,920
I told you kids to stay back!
Don't do anything dangerous!

296
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,790
What're you saying, Mom?! We're a family!

297
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,350
What's a family for if we
don't help each other?!

298
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,560
What a sassy thing to say, you stupid son.

299
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,480
Bro! Over there!

300
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,650
Guys, teach them a lesson
they won't soon forget.

301
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,340
Mom!

302
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,510
Bro!

303
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,350
You small fry...

304
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,700
Seventy-two Pound Phoenix!

305
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,640
Die!

306
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,530
D-Dammit!

307
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,700
--Incredible!
--Just as we'd expect from you, bro!

308
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,280
Yeah! Amazing!

309
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,560
All right! Good job! That's my oldest son!

310
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,050
You're still saying that? Hey, lady. Listen to me.

311
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,700
Now, to start with, I...

312
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,380
Are your friends as good as our family?

313
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,970
Yeah, they're like that.

314
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,430
Then why didn't you tell me sooner?!

315
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,010
I told you a bunch of times!

316
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,500
You're a member of our precious family,

317
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,570
but, well, if you're gonna run away
from home for a bit, I won't stop you.

318
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,530
"Run away from home"?

319
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
Take care of yourself.

320
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,900
Bro, congrats on running away from home!

321
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,620
You should go now before
Mom changes her mind.

322
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,660
See you later!

323
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,040
Well then, bye.

324
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,570
Bye-bye, bro!

325
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,320
--Take care!
--Bro!

326
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,210
--Thank you!
--See you again!

327
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,130
Wait a sec!

328
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,090
I can't wait!

329
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,980
I've come this far. I should be fine now.

330
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,350
Hold it!

331
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,560
That woman!

332
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,780
He never learns, does he...?

333
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,940
He can't run from us.

334
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,630
Geez, he forgot to change his shirt.

335
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,030
What am I gonna do with my oldest son?

336
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,240
Seriously...!

337
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,990
Wait! I said, wait!

338
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,950
Give me a break!

339
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,840
H-Hey, don't pull me, Chimney!

340
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
Grandma told me about this place.

341
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,550
A stall, huh?

342
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,470
Oh, hey, pops! How're you doing?!

343
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,470
A petty stall like this wouldn't...

344
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,640
Hm? Looks like the cook here
is better than I expected.

345
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

346
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,400
"Sanji's Shock! Mysterious Old Man
and His Super Yummy Cooking!"

347
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
