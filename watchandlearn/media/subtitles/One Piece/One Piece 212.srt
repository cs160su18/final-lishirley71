2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,710
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,750
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,260
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,480
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,080
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,340
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,890
Zoro and Sanji have teamed up
in Round #2's Groggy Ring

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,410
in order to win Chopper back.

25
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,420
Hamburg catches Sanji! Incredible!

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,740
He's within range of the ring!

27
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,950
I ain't gonna...

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,910
...let 'em score!

29
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,200
I can't let that damn swordsman snub me...

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
...by saving my hide!

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,460
Now I'm mad, Leader!

32
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,550
Hamburger Hammer!

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,180
Punk...

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,150
...Attack!

35
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,640
Sling Tackle!

36
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,620
Size Attack: S!

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,390
M!

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,240
L!

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,370
The opponents literally are "groggy"!

40
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,290
All that remains now is to stuff
the ball man into his ring coffin

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,170
and this will be two wins in a row!

42
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,260
Hey, cook...

43
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,470
Lend me a hand for ten seconds...

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Sounds like... a reasonable length of time...

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:37,570
"A Barrage of Red Cards in Groggy Ring!"

46
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,990
This is Round #2 of the
Davy Back Fight, Groggy Ring!

47
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,490
The outcome of the match is now clear as day!

48
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,820
No one is a match for our monsters!

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,370
Although Team Straw Hat was defeated,

50
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I can't help but applaud them
for putting up such a gallant--!

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,380
Hey! Look!

52
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,540
Wha...?!

53
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,090
They're up! Team Straw Hat is standing again!

54
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,640
Roronoa the swordsman and Sanji
the cook are terrifyingly tough!

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,100
They really know how to make a game exciting!

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,810
They're back up! Now get those jerks!

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,990
But do these two have
enough strength left to fight?!

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,620
Hey, you guys...

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,040
One Monster Burger, please!

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,460
--Wh-What?!
--What could that mean?

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,630
Huh? Do they sell burgers here?

62
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,750
Obviously not!

63
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,650
My word!

64
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,180
Our boss has just ordered a Monster Burger!

65
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,620
Hold on! They're clearly using weapons now!

66
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,080
Grind 'em up like a burger patty...

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,800
And slice 'em good like fresh pickles...

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,260
Who are the guests?!

69
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,220
Green lettuce... and yellow cheese!

70
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,050
Crush it all between big pans and you get...

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,480
...a Monster Burger!

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,190
There it is! Their utterly
horrific triple weapon attack!

73
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,480
There's no escape! Foul play
like this clearly calls for red cards!

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,660
Team Straw Hat is in a tough bind!

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,080
Oh, but wouldn't you know!

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,790
The ref just happens to have
his back turned as he stretches!

77
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,630
What are you doing?!

78
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,530
--Stop, Luffy!
--But...!

79
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,180
They want us to butt in!

80
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,890
We need to grin and bear it, Luffy!

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,350
Everything's set! The Groggy
Monsters commence their attack!

82
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,190
Whatever happens now, don't blame me!

83
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,400
Naturally, they go after Sanji, the ball man!

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,620
Will he be ground up, sliced,
and crushed into a hamburger patty?!

85
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,920
I can't make much with
third-rate ingredients like you guys,

86
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,250
but I'll cook each and every one of you!

87
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,790
You're mincemeat now!

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,880
Troisième...

89
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,630
--He's fast!
--...Haché!

90
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,150
Bouquetiere...

91
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,980
...Shoot!

92
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, no!

93
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,950
Stop crushing!

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,750
Leader!

95
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,130
How dare you...?!

96
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,510
Don't forget this is a team battle.

97
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,100
Why, you...!

98
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
I'll cut you up!

99
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,770
No-Sword Style...

100
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,610
...Tatsu...

101
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,350
...Maki!

102
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,540
M-My word! Big Pan has fallen
victim to Pickles' spinning blades!

103
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, no! Dammit...!

104
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,760
Bad Manner...

105
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,390
...Kick Course!

106
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,210
I-Incredible!

107
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,970
The gigantic Big Pan was falling over,
but is now upright again!

108
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:41,700
A tremendous kick has kept
Big Pan on his feet and in a daze!

109
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,830
What will Pickles do now?!

110
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,540
Team Foxy is in a pinch!

111
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh! Now Zoro the swordsman charges in!

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Naturally, he's going after
Big Pan, the ball man!

113
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,260
You're not getting past me!

114
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,150
I've had enough of you and the ref!

115
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,440
The crowd-- no, the referee-- takes a direct hit!

116
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,490
Sanji the cook is truly fearsome!

117
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,560
That was on purpose...!

118
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,500
How dare he... hurt the ref...?!

119
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,120
Red card!

120
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,000
Huh?

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,800
My cards and whistle... They're gone...

122
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,130
You're a naughty girl.

123
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,720
Couldn't help it. It's an old habit of mine.

124
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,900
Oh! What's this?!

125
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,360
Is Team Straw Hat arguing again,
in front of the lone Big Pan?!

126
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Armée de l'Air Power Shoot!

127
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,080
I-Incredible!

128
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,500
Big Pan...

129
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,670
--What?!
--No way!

130
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,170
...the gigantic wotan...

131
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,130
...is airborne!

132
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,630
Go!

133
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,470
They're headed for the goal ring!

134
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,470
No!

135
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,030
Goal!

136
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,340
I-Incredible!

137
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,180
He's airborne!

138
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,640
Go!

139
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,320
No!

140
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,030
It goes in! Goal! Goal! Goal!

141
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,910
Nice, Zoro! Sanji-kun!

142
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,060
All right! Zoro! Sanji! You're awesome!

143
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,420
You bums actually did it!

144
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,170
Y-You did it!

145
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,830
Aww! But I don't wanna give Choppy back!

146
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,350
Zoro! Sanji! Way to go!

147
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,960
Whoa! They're awesome!

148
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Bravo! Bravo!

149
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,340
I'm totally moved to tears!

150
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,360
You guys really are the best!

151
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,990
You dimwits! Who the heck
praises their enemy?!

152
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,240
I can't believe this! No one
defeats the Groggy Monsters...!

153
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, hi, Ref. Wakey-wakey.

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,040
Hurry and blow the whistle! Go on!

155
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,980
O-Oh, right.

156
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,880
His behavior toward me was a flagrant foul!

157
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,630
He's outta the game!

158
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,510
And there's the final whistle!

159
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,390
The Groggy Ring match is over!

160
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,490
You did it!

161
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,190
Hurray! We won!

162
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,240
Way to go! Zoro! Sanji!

163
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,040
Thanks for your hard work!

164
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,340
In Round #2 of the Davy Back Fight,

165
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,800
Team Straw Hat has
unbelievably snatched victory away

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,020
from the previously
undefeated Groggy Monsters!

167
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,770
Of course we won!
Zoro and Sanji would never lose!

168
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,070
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

169
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,200
Did you see that?! Did you fall for me?!

170
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
You were wonderful!

171
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,910
You jerks! Don't scare me like that!

172
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,720
That hurts.

173
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,130
You did great! You did just what I said!

174
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,920
You didn't do a thing.

175
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,360
Now that Team Straw Hat has
won Round #2's Groggy Ring game,

176
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,620
they're allowed to swipe either a
member of the Foxy Pirates' crew

177
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,570
or the Foxy Pirates' symbol!

178
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,270
Who does the Straw Hat captain want?!

179
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
Isn't it obvious?

180
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,990
Huh?! Is it me...?

181
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,090
They wanted me from the very start...!

182
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,920
Oh, man... I'm not ready to go yet...

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,760
Crap, it must be me! Our eyes just met...!

184
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,940
I bet it'll be me...

185
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,640
Could be me!

186
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,770
If he chooses me, I'll say goodbye
to these guys with a smile...

187
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,730
They like me, I just know it...

188
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,270
Come on, Luffy... Hurry...

189
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,520
--Okay! I choose--!
--Hold on!

190
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,330
What is it, Nami?

191
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,790
Their boss will probably take
part in the next round, right?

192
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,940
Yeah...

193
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,250
With that Slow-Slow Beam of his,

194
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,390
we won't stand a chance in any game,
no matter what the rules are!

195
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,930
But if we take him now,
we'll have the upper hand in Round 3!

196
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,630
If we take Chopper back now
but lose in this next round,

197
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,020
they could just steal him again!

198
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,060
In which case, taking their boss now

199
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,980
and playing the next game in tip-top condition

200
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,190
is the best way to get
Chopper back and keep him.

201
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:33,810
U-U-Unbelievable! Is he going to
call for the Foxy Pirates' captain?!

202
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,330
Th-That's the Peanut Strategy!

203
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,620
You guys are the lowest!

204
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,210
You lousy Peanutters!

205
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,940
Fight us fair and square!

206
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,500
There's no rule against it,

207
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,260
but suddenly calling out an opponent's
leader after the second round

208
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,140
is an obvious attempt at avoiding
a fair-and-square, head-on match!

209
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,680
I can't believe my ears! This is the
devilish idea of an inhuman woman!

210
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,710
Her name is Nami, the heathen navigator!

211
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,510
How dare you insult Nami-san?!
I oughta filet you!

212
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,810
In the long history of Davy Back Fights,

213
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,830
no one has ever tried to
pull this wretched trick!

214
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,950
Let me ask you all! Is a win against
a leaderless team a true victory?!

215
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,410
No!

216
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,050
After swearing to Davy Jones
to hold a fair match,

217
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,380
is it okay to turn it into a lie?!

218
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,840
No!

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,070
--Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!...
--I hate them...

220
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,080
Even if it doesn't go against the rules,

221
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,840
it seems it would go against pirate aesthetics.

222
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,730
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!...

223
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,910
What's with them?! They're making me mad!

224
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,500
I'm with Nami on this!

225
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,070
Their reaction's only natural.
You're in the wrong, Nami.

226
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,360
Will you shut up already?! Quit actin' cocky!

227
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,820
Our apologies!

228
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,400
Still, like it or not, Monkey D. Luffy,
captain of the winning team,

229
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,860
gets to decide how this game will unfold!

230
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,720
He's free to choose anyone
he wants from Team Foxy!

231
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,120
He'll choose me, I just know it...

232
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,960
I bet an adventure with them would be fun...

233
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,840
It's obvious I'm the only choice here...

234
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,340
No, don't look at me! Please! Don't!

235
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,350
Is he gonna choose me? These guys are cool!

236
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,780
Is it me? Is he gonna pick me?!

237
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,490
Wha...?! It's gonna be me, huh?!

238
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,160
Straw Hat... You're...

239
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,190
You're going to choose me, aren't you?!

240
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,750
Yes, yes... It's obvious you are!

241
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,350
Farewell, Foxy Pirates.
Farewell, wonderful crew!

242
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,430
When he picks me, I'll say goodbye
to them with a smile on my face...

243
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:06,560
Oh, having such a marvelous personality
and beautiful looks is a sin!

244
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,730
That's definitely something
the Straw Hat Pirates lack!

245
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,270
Oh, there's no doubt they like me!

246
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,780
Say, Navigator.

247
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,280
Your proposal does give us
an overwhelming advantage,

248
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,250
but that also makes their boss part of our crew.

249
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,530
No, thanks.

250
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,920
Our boss has sunk into the ground
from the weight of his feelings!

251
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,170
I can't believe they all
rejected our boss like that!

252
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,140
Oh, Boss! It's okay! We need you!

253
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,330
We do, Boss!

254
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,010
G-Guys...

255
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,390
Let's teach these guys a lesson!

256
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,770
Yeah! I can't wait for the next round!

257
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,690
We love you, Boss!

258
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,020
Boss!

259
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,280
Guys...

260
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,740
Yes! You are my only true comrades!

261
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,000
Thank you!

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,830
Cut the crap, will ya?

263
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,200
Boss!

264
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,370
Now that Team Straw Hat's
harassment of our boss has ended,

265
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,370
it's time to pick someone!

266
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,830
Who will he choose?!

267
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,550
All right, then. I wanna take back...

268
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,020
...Shelly!

269
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,050
Wh-What's this?!

270
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:38,370
Captain Monkey D. Luffy has
chosen Shelly, Tonjit's former horse!

271
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,910
What in the world is he thinking?!

272
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,940
Do you know what you just said,
you dumb captain?!

273
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,100
Of course.

274
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,750
Seriously! What are you thinking?!

275
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,860
Urgh! You always pull this nonsense!

276
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,880
Umm, could you not pull my face?

277
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,900
Looks like you're staying with us, Choppy!

278
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,450
If you weren't going to take their boss,

279
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,280
then you should've chosen Chopper!

280
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,930
But...!

281
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,610
Old stilts guy. I took Shelly
back from those guys.

282
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,950
You guys...

283
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,570
Now you can always be together.

284
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,470
Say, what happened to you two in the back?

285
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,660
You're really hurt. Are you okay?

286
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,370
Some idiot with crazy eyebrows
slowed me down, that's all.

287
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,490
Huh?!

288
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,460
They're certainly full of life...

289
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,550
I appreciate it. Thank you...

290
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,100
It's nothin'. Don't worry about it!

291
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,350
That's a good girl!

292
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,830
Well, that explains that.

293
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,670
Guess it couldn't be helped this time!

294
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,020
Let me treat you all! How about
some cheese at my place?

295
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,480
No, no more of that!

296
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,240
I truly appreciate this.

297
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,910
Thank you.

298
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,530
I'm glad for you, old guy!

299
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,530
Are you sure about this, though?
Your friend is still...

300
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, Luffy! You need to
consider Chopper's feelings too!

301
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,800
Luffy...

302
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,000
Chopper...

303
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
Sorry, Chopper!

304
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,650
We will win the next game and get you back!

305
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,570
So just hang on a little more!

306
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,020
You're a man, right?!

307
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,940
Got a problem with that?

308
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,530
Nope!

309
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,950
Chopper...

310
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,450
Leave it to me! It'll be just fine!

311
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,350
Yeah, sure. Uh-huh.

312
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,040
I wonder what the next game will be.

313
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,960
Let's get started!

314
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,130
We will win Chopper back!

315
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,200
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

316
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,750
Chasing after something constant

317
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,380
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

318
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,630
Even when we're exhausted

319
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,800
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

320
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,220
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

321
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,140
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

322
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,940
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

323
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,900
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

324
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,980
Eternally... Eternally...

325
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,780
Wild fantasies from our childhood

326
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,610
We trace unforgettable memories

327
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,290
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

328
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,080
To this familiar sunny sky

329
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,920
Together we entrust our feelings

330
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,500
We go beyond the changing time

331
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Eternally... Eternally...

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,590
Round #3 is the Roller Skate Race!
A five-round match on a track!

333
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,010
They'll take me if we lose! Because I'm cute!

334
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,220
You gotta be kidding-- Oww!

335
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,850
You're absolutely no
match for us! For you see...!

336
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,930
--Okay, guys! Let's get Chopper back!
--Yeah!

337
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,230
Ignored again...?

338
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

339
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,400
"Round 3! The Round-and-Round Roller Race!"

340
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
