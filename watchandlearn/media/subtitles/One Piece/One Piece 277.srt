00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,660
Has the Buster Call order been issued?

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,510
No, we still have to be on standby.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,090
Hurry!

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,120
Run to the evacuation ship!

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,100
So this is a Poneglyph, huh?

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,560
Yeah. I heard that even if we tried to
blow it up, it wouldn't even get a scratch.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,590
What a creepy stone... To think that
this stuff is scattered around the world...

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,440
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,820
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,830
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,710
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

13
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,590
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,390
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

15
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,640
we will be able to make it through

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,900
Always!

17
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,610
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

18
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,580
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,620
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,210
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

21
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,520
We can't stop here

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,540
Around the world

23
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,800
Start me up!

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,540
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,650
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

26
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,610
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,420
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,370
Brand New World

29
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,830
Start me up!

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,520
"The Tragedy of Ohara!
The Terror of Buster Call"

31
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,630
Is that right?

32
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,020
Yes, they deserve the death penalty.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
Since we seized the evidence,
we'll carry out your orders.

34
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,480
It cannot be helped. This is quite unfortunate;

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,110
however, they violated the
world's laws. We cannot overlook it.

36
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,710
Stop the blatant superficial talk,
Five Elder Stars.

37
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,280
Wha...! Don't be rude! You're talking
to the leaders of the world!

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,240
Is this Ohara's Professor Clover,
the authority of archaeology?

39
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,100
I know your name well, since you've
contributed to the world's culture.

40
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,540
To think that someone of your
caliber would take the wrong path...

41
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,320
The past belongs to all mankind.

42
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,580
No one has the right to stop one from
wanting to know our unspoken history!

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,450
Professor...

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,770
Reading the Poneglyphs makes it
possible to revive the ancient weapon,

45
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,730
which puts the world in danger.

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Even if your research has the best of intentions,

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,030
all it takes is for someone to
come along and use your research.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,530
No matter what happened in the past,
if humans created that history,

49
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,250
we should accept it all.

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,790
If we don't succumb to fear
and learn all of history,

51
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,410
we can take countermeasures
no matter what happens.

52
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,710
That's an idealistic argument.

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,470
Is that so? Isn't that reasoning
just a convenient excuse for you?

54
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,670
Out of what is still left to us,

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,300
what interests us the most are the contents
of the Poneglyphs, along with their reason

56
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,860
for existing in the first place.

57
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,310
Why did the ancients take the trouble
to inscribe the text on hard stones

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,190
in order to pass it down to the future?

59
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,400
They inscribed history on unbreakable stones

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,860
and scattered them around the world.

61
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,610
Is it not because they thought that
their message would be eradicated

62
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,830
if they wrote it on paper or in books?

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,950
In other words, it is the proof that
those who left the Poneglyphs

64
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,850
clearly had an enemy.

65
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,130
What're you trying to say, Professor Clover?

66
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,090
If we assume that they were
defeated by some kind of enemy

67
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,420
and so ceased to exist,

68
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,860
this enemy must've remained
in history from that point on.

69
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,940
Coincidentally, just when the
"Blank Century" ended 800 years ago,

70
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,660
the World Government was founded.

71
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,620
If the current World Government was
the "enemy" of those that ceased to exist,

72
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,120
one could think that the "Blank Century"
is an inconvenient history

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,600
that was hushed up by the World Government.

74
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,310
By analyzing the ancient
documents and some Poneglyphs,

75
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,270
we eventually noticed
the existence of a country.

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,220
What the documents brought to light
was the existence of a grand kingdom.

77
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,180
Although it seems to have
boasted much power in the past,

78
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,560
the information on this country
has obsessively been erased.

79
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,450
They probably sensed they'd be
defeated by the allied countries,

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,740
later to become the World Government,

81
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,790
and so inscribed all the truth on
stones to pass it down to the future.

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,260
Indeed, those stones are the Poneglyphs
that remain to this very day.

83
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,210
I see. That's a bold hypothesis.

84
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,730
It's true that the ancient weapon
would threaten the world.

85
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,550
However, isn't it actually that the
World Government is more threatened

86
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,810
by people becoming aware of that
kingdom's existence and ideology?

87
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,190
We still have to analyze what this threat is,

88
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,580
but the name of this once-prosperous
kingdom that holds the key to everything is...

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,210
Eliminate him!

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Professor!

91
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
Ohara has...

92
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,810
--You bastards!
--How dare you...!

93
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,580
Professor Clover!

94
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,350
...come to know too much.

95
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,950
Give the attack signal.

96
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,860
Don't move!

97
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,130
Don't let even a single person escape.

98
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,200
Well then, using this golden transponder snail

99
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,430
entrusted to me by Admiral Sengoku...

100
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,750
Professor!

101
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,370
Robin...

102
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,880
You fool! You shouldn't be here. Run!

103
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,860
...I'll initiate a Buster Call!

104
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,020
Take care of the rest.

105
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,260
He did something!

106
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,510
Hurry to the evacuation ship, Robin.

107
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,680
No! I don't wanna be alone!

108
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,810
Don't say such a foolish
thing at a time like this.

109
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,330
Robin...

110
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,160
That's the Buster Call request!

111
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,880
All battleships, to your positions!
Prepare to open fire!

112
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,860
Hey...

113
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,740
Look!

114
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,250
The Tree of Knowledge is on fire!

115
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,170
Hey, World Government! What're you doing?!

116
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,700
Taking our lives should be enough!

117
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,440
Don't look at me. It must've caught
fire from the explosions earlier.

118
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,430
This isn't a joke!

119
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,260
Do you realize how many important
documents there are in there?!

120
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,430
Hey! Don't move!

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,920
Ah... We don't need guns anymore.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,580
Those from the Government, pull out.

123
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,010
Hurry up and get the books!

124
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,670
Put out the fire in the library!

125
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,090
Circulate water!

126
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,850
Take the books out of the library!

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,480
Bring that woman with us.

128
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,340
Come.

129
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,290
There's a piece of information
that only she knows.

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,750
It'll cause a problem if she dies here.

131
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,510
Mommy.

132
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,130
Robin...! Please... make sure you escape.

133
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't die, no matter what!

134
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,490
Your nose!

135
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,600
Robin! Hurry!

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,460
Get out of here now!

137
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,980
--Robin-chan!
--Robin!

138
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you... my mom?

139
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,430
Olvia! Are you gonna come
aboard the ship or not?

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,370
Mommy!

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,500
--I'll hold her, so go already!
--Mommy! Don't go! Mommy!

142
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,670
Mommy! Mommy!

143
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,430
I'm sorry, Robin.

144
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,680
I can never call myself your mother again.

145
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,450
I can't be allowed... to be your
mother after all these years.

146
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,740
--Monster!
--Monster!

147
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,490
Her mom abandoned her!

148
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,410
Robin! Those are my daughter's clothes!

149
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm sorry, Aunt Roji! I wanted
to try them on just once!

150
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,060
You eat a lot for someone who lives here free.

151
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,110
Are you...

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,400
...my mom?!

153
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,270
Hmm? What? You have a kid?

154
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,620
No.

155
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,700
Olvia-san...

156
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,010
I'm sorry...

157
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,620
...but I think you're confusing
me with someone else.

158
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,190
Forgive me, Robin! I don't wanna
make you a "criminal's daughter"!

159
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,130
Olvia...

160
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,840
What a weird brat.

161
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,380
Hey, let's go!

162
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,230
I'm Robin!

163
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,360
I've grown, but don't you remember me?!

164
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
I've been waiting for you to return all this time!

165
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,730
Are you...

166
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,030
...really not...

167
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,490
...my mom?

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,750
I wanted you...

169
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,310
...to hold my hand...

170
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,270
...and walk with me someday...

171
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,380
So I studied hard and was able
to become an archaeologist!

172
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,300
I can read Poneglyphs, too!

173
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,650
That brat can?!

174
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,150
Stop it, Robin!

175
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,140
So...

176
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,120
...please let me stay... with you!

177
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,130
Mom!

178
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,090
Robin...!

179
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,090
Please...

180
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,370
...don't leave me...

181
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
...alone anymore!

182
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,680
What?! What the hell is this attack?!

183
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,410
I'm exercising a Buster Call.

184
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,820
Commence concerted fire!

185
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,990
We're targeting everything on Ohara,
the island of archaeology!

186
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,280
The research by the Ohara scholars
has reached a level we never imagined.

187
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,780
Knowledge can be transferred.
Don't let it out of that island.

188
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,790
Annihilate the devils living in Ohara!
In the name of justice!

189
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,590
Dammit! What's going on?!

190
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,680
We haven't gotten off of the island yet!
Are they trying to kill us?!

191
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,400
The Tree of Knowledge is directly
being hit by cannonballs, too!

192
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,060
There's no mistaking that this
is Headquarters' military power.

193
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,150
The government was probably going
to do this from the start. How foolish.

194
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,660
Chief. That brat said that she's an archaeologist.

195
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,150
Yeah, she did say that.
I don't know if it's true or not,

196
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,120
but when we don't know,
eliminating them solves the problem.

197
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Remember her face well so that
you don't let her leave the island.

198
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,660
Retreat!

199
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,750
Then I'll take Olvia.

200
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,040
Forget her! No time for that now!
Just leave her here!

201
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,540
If we stay here, we'll get killed, too!

202
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,260
My life is the most important thing!

203
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,060
All, retreat! Go back to the ship!

204
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Do something about the fire in the library!

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,870
Protect the Tree of Knowledge!

206
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,580
I wanted to do this...

207
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,800
...all this time!

208
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,410
Robin!

209
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,020
Mom!

210
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,770
It's my fault... Robin...

211
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,740
Is it true that you can read Poneglyphs?

212
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,930
If I had properly kept an eye on you...

213
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,410
I'm sorry. I wanted to be able
to read them at any cost, so--

214
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm really surprised to know that you've
become able to do things like that.

215
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,290
You must've tried hard and studied a lot.

216
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,090
It's not something anyone can do.
That's amazing, Robin!

217
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,120
Fortunately, the officials from earlier
are the only ones who know about it.

218
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,680
This is no time to be sitting around here.

219
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,190
Olvia! Take Robin and run!

220
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,230
If you can somehow sneak
Robin onto the evacuation ship,

221
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,580
you can leave the island!

222
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,700
Robin! There you are! I looked all over for you!

223
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,910
Saul!

224
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,160
So you were able to see Olvia!

225
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,010
Saul! What are you doing on this island?!

226
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,840
By some twist of fate, I got shipwrecked
and saved by Robin on the beach.

227
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,030
More importantly, the situation is terrible!

228
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,220
You have to leave the island immediately!

229
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,920
Please take care of Robin!

230
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,140
Please let my daughter escape
from the island at any cost!

231
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,320
What?! No! What about you, Mom?!
Aren't you gonna come with me?!

232
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,780
Olvia... What are you gonna...

233
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,700
There's still something
that I have to do here, so...

234
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,010
Mom! I don't wanna be separated!
I was finally able to meet you!

235
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,330
I'll stay here, too!

236
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,360
Robin...

237
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
You're an Ohara scholar,
so you should know this very well.

238
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,320
History is the treasure of mankind.

239
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,540
It'll certainly light up the future
you young ones will live in.

240
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,290
But the history we received
from the past will disappear

241
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,880
unless we pass it on to the next era.

242
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,850
--Put out the fire!
--Protect the books!

243
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,840
Revealing the history isn't
what Ohara was trying to do.

244
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,310
We just wanted to accept the voices
of the past and protect them.

245
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,000
Our research will end now,
but even if Ohara is obliterated...

246
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,460
...we cannot give up the future
you young ones will live in!

247
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,150
I don't understand!

248
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,400
You will understand someday.

249
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,460
Now, go, Saul!

250
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,300
Are you sure about this?

251
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,620
Yes.

252
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,690
No! I'll stay here, too! Mom!

253
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,670
Mom!

254
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,450
I was happy to hear you call me that.

255
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,660
Thank you!

256
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,360
From now on, for you and me both...

257
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,620
Live, Robin!

258
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,160
What?! Vice Admiral! Vice Admiral Kuzan!

259
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,300
What?!

260
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,130
On the island... Yes, there's no doubt about it!

261
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,670
So what's the matter?! Just spit it out!

262
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,220
It's the deserter, Vice Admiral Saul!

263
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,600
Saul! Go back! Please!

264
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,860
No! I can't do that!

265
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,810
Robin! Be proud, Robin!

266
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,770
Your mom is honorable! Ohara is honorable!

267
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,310
Someday, pass down this island's history, Robin!

268
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,190
Ohara fought against the world!

269
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,720
Stop it! Capturing them is enough!

270
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,080
They're not even violent pirates! Are you
so weak that you can't suppress them?!

271
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,040
We've caught history
exploration ships many times,

272
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,860
but I don't understand why they had to die.

273
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,550
Vice Admiral Saul! We found one survivor!

274
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,760
How dare you kill my fellow scholars?!

275
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,730
Do you really want the weapon?

276
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,180
What pitiful people...

277
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,890
You don't have your own will
and yet you cast judgment on us...

278
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,350
Hey! He's a Vice Admiral!

279
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,800
...not doubting laws and saying it's
to prevent the revival of the weapon!

280
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,780
You're just frightened by the
history that you don't even know!

281
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
This is a top-secret mission.

282
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,000
Buster Call?

283
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,100
Five Vice Admirals command
ten battleships in a Buster Call.

284
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,500
I want you to be one of them.

285
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,620
They are just scholars.
Why do we have to go that far?

286
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,120
Those scholars that we've captured, too!

287
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,460
They look like they just really
want to know the history to me!

288
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,230
If their research is so dangerous,
the Government should help them, too!

289
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,150
We're the ones who actually have to kill people!

290
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,680
Give me the proof that they're completely evil!

291
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,650
Are you doubting the Government?
Don't fight! Just follow orders!

292
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,410
I'd like to ask you some questions.

293
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,370
This is an emergency! Vice Admiral
Saul took a criminal and deserted!

294
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,850
He knows everything about the operation.

295
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,040
After them! Capture Saul and Olvia without fail!

296
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,290
You can shoot them if needed!

297
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,990
Pursuers are coming! I'll deal with them!

298
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,970
You'll never be able to
go back to the Navy, Saul.

299
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,940
That's fine. I can't stay in the
Navy having this sense of distrust.

300
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,640
Even if they're obeying the law,
this operation is too tyrannical.

301
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,890
I'm just following my sense of justice.

302
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,850
Now, hurry to your hometown
to let people know.

303
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm not gonna thank you for this.

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,340
Good luck.

305
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,540
Fire!

306
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,830
They're aiming at me!

307
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,700
Saul!

308
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,330
Ah! It hit him!

309
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm sorry!

310
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,880
Don't apologize! He's already
those evil people's accomplice!

311
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm sorry, Robin. That must've scared you.

312
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,850
Hold on a sec.

313
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,780
That must be it! Firing this close?
What if you had hurt Robin?!

314
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,730
Vice Admiral! Please stop! What're you doing?!

315
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,900
I don't know what justice is in this situation,
so I'll just protect my friend!

316
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,040
Stop it! Saul!

317
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,900
Be prepared!

318
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:00,220
If you make an enemy of me,
I'll make you pay for it!

319
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,140
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

320
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,060
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

321
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,190
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

322
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,190
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

323
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,450
We'll become No. 1

324
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,320
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

325
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,530
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

326
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,700
an era created by risking everything

327
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,830
We always try our best, let's go!

328
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,830
If we want to achieve glory,

329
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,210
now is the time--don't be afraid

330
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,130
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

331
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,090
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

332
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,090
We can take off with unknown powers

333
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,350
We don't fear, and we don't waver

334
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,060
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

335
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,100
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

336
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,070
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

337
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,320
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

338
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Charge ahead

339
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's start running towards tomorrow

340
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

341
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,580
Robin! We still haven't heard you say it!

342
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,710
Say you want to live!

343
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,960
Robin!

344
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
Robin...

345
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,710
--Robin...
--Robin-chan!

346
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,510
Robin!

347
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,850
I... I...

348
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,470
On the next episode of One Piece!

349
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,070
"Say You Want to Live! We Are Your Friends!!"

350
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
