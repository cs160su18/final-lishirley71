00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,980
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,800
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,270
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,430
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,420
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,750
So you finally found a tree to call home?

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,520
No one is born into this world to be alone!

36
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,110
Yeah, you're right, Saul.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
Hey! Robin!

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,390
Maybe... I'll try it, too.

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,040
Yeah! Do it! Do it, Robin!

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,540
Please don't do it, Robin-chan!

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,390
It's like a ghost town here!
Everyone's already there!

42
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,250
Yeah! I know our duty is to ensure the
train leaves safely, but I can't believe

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,970
that we're late for the party
held for the entire town...!

44
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,310
But... I can't... run anymore!

45
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,750
Don't give up!

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,220
We have to go to Paulie-san's
party no matter what!

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,500
What?! It's Paulie-san's?! I didn't know!

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,250
Of course it is!

49
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,700
The town is still in the
process of being restored,

50
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,720
and yet Straw Hat is holding
a big party at Galley-La!

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,000
No matter how you look at it, it's...

52
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,450
With that girl?!

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,020
That's right!

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,770
It's a wedding party!

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,770
If that's the case, I can't
just sit around like this!

56
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,870
After all, we're important to them,
since we witnessed that precious moment...

57
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,590
--Am I wrong?
--You're not wrong!

58
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,320
We may even end up having to deliver
a congratulatory speech! Tada!

59
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,340
Seriously?!

60
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,780
Yes, seriously!

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,650
I'll do my best!

62
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,070
Let's do our best!

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,040
Yep!

64
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,230
Now, let us go, my friend!

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,760
Yow! Entrant #9985, Sogeking!

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,100
I'll sing about the pride of
the man hidden behind the mask.

67
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,890
♪ I was born on the island of snipers! ♪

68
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,940
Yow! Yow!

69
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,110
--♪ I never miss my mark! Lulu lala lu! ♪
--Yow, yow, yow, yow!

70
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,510
Whoa!

71
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,160
This is far from over!

72
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,310
Guys! Let's all party!

73
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,460
"Shanks Makes a Move!
The Linchpin to the Reckless Era"

74
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,340
Five Elder Stars! Five Elder Stars!
Something terrible has happened!

75
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,050
What's the matter?

76
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,200
The fleet we sent out to the New World
the other day has been defeated...

77
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Also, Red-Haired Shanks and Edward Newgate,
aka Whitebeard, two of the Four Emperors,

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,340
are finally about to make direct contact!

79
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,510
What?!

80
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,020
Shanks?!

81
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,450
Old man! Old man!

82
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,040
Red Hair wants to see you!

83
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,020
Yeah... Let him come aboard.

84
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,220
That brat better have brought good booze.

85
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,620
"Navy"

86
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,650
Is it true that the fleet has been defeated?

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, it seems like it.

88
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,380
So Red Hair and Whitebeard will be in contact?

89
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,770
Attention!

90
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,650
Listen up! We don't know
what will happen next!

91
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,860
Stand by on maximum alert!

92
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,390
Yes, sir!

93
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,800
Destination straight ahead! Furl the sails!

94
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,450
Captain! Red Hair is here!

95
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,210
Red Hair is coming.

96
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,140
Greenhorns oughta stay back...

97
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,160
...unless you wanna get knocked out.

98
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,260
Knocked out?! What're you talking about?

99
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,810
Just go to the back and stay there.

100
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,260
Ah!

101
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,360
Hey, guys, what's the matter?!

102
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,180
What's going on?!

103
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh... I guess it's already too late.

104
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,350
--Hey, guys! Say something! Hey!
--Don't make a fuss!

105
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,240
They've just been knocked
unconscious, that's all.

106
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,700
Those who lack the mettle can't even
stay conscious in front of that man.

107
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,620
As always...

108
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,620
...he's got an incredibly strong Haki...

109
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,310
Pardon me... for the bit of intimidation
I gave off, since I'm on an enemy ship.

110
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,510
Whenever I see your face,
the scar that guy gave me throbs.

111
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,770
"Alcohol"

112
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,510
I brought some healing spirits with me.

113
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,110
I don't intend to fight.
There's something I want to discuss with you.

114
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,560
Says the man who shows up
throwing his Haki around?

115
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,270
You fool.

116
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,490
Hey, Red Hair! What'd you do that for?

117
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,420
Oh, you're Marco of the first division, right?

118
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,780
Why don't you join my gang?

119
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,210
Shut up!

120
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,070
Old man, what should we...

121
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,470
Yeah, looks like there won't
be a battle. Leave us alone.

122
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,250
This booze is from the West Blue...

123
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,620
This is the cheap stuff, isn't it?

124
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,800
Having traveled around the world,

125
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,530
I find nothing's better than the booze
made from the water I grew up with.

126
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,030
It's booze from my hometown.

127
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,750
Please try it.

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,010
Not too bad.

129
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,970
Roger, Garp, Sengoku...

130
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,020
There aren't that many people
left who know about that era.

131
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,140
It's been 22 years. That's just natural.

132
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,610
You sure have worked your way up the ladder.

133
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,570
You were just a young apprentice
on Gol D. Roger's ship.

134
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,040
Since we were fighting Roger's
gang all the time back then,

135
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,280
you and I got acquainted in an unusual way.

136
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,560
There you are, Whitebeard!

137
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,740
Now we've found you!
You can't escape anymore!

138
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,340
We're gonna dye that beard of yours blood red!

139
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,300
Hey, my nose isn't blood red!

140
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,010
Has that funny Red-nose who was
with you kicked the bucket yet?

141
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,390
Oh, Buggy? That brings back memories.

142
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,520
We parted in Loguetown

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,470
on the day our captain was executed,
and I haven't seen him since.

144
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,930
Come with me, Buggy!

145
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,030
I refuse to be your subordinate, you moron!

146
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,410
I heard that he's still a pirate.

147
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,440
To me, the time seemed to flash by.

148
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,170
Many pass down stories about the days when
you and Hawk-Eye used to duel like legends,

149
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,050
but those days seem like yesterday to me.

150
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,850
When someone of your caliber lost
one of his arms in the East Blue,

151
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,010
everyone was surprised.

152
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,520
What enemy did you give your left arm to?

153
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,270
This...?

154
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,110
I wasn't gonna take you anyway!

155
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,120
You'll never be a pirate!

156
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,050
I will too!

157
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,540
Someday, I'm gonna gather a crew
every bit as good as yours,

158
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,000
and I'm gonna find the greatest
treasure in the world,

159
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,570
and I'm gonna be King of
the Pirates! I'll show you!

160
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,880
I bet it... on a new era.

161
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,110
Fine, as long as you have no regrets.

162
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,350
Whitebeard...

163
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,020
I've experienced many battles
and received many scars,

164
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,860
but the scar that throbs right now is this one.

165
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,260
This wasn't a wound from an adventure
or one received from Hawk-Eye.

166
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,350
The one who gave me this scar
was one of your men...

167
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,390
Blackbeard Teach.

168
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,980
I didn't let my guard down.

169
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,440
Do you get what I want to say, Whitebeard?

170
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,770
He was quietly waiting for the right moment.

171
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,250
He didn't become a
commander or make his name.

172
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,650
He kept his true self hidden

173
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,870
and stood in the shadow of the
great pirate Whitebeard all this time.

174
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,200
And now, he's gained power
and started to make his move.

175
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,760
In the end, he'll aim for the top.

176
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,270
With his own will...

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,660
...he'll eventually come
to take even your position.

178
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,310
What do you want me to do?
That's what you came to talk about, right?

179
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,940
Please stop Ace!

180
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,120
Although he's young, you made him
your second division commander.

181
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,870
Ace is strong!

182
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,610
I know that much.

183
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,380
But that fame and trust
make the matter complicated.

184
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,590
It's still too soon to have those two fight.

185
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,160
Stay away from Blackbeard Teach!

186
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,610
That's all I want to ask.

187
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,190
The old man's laughing?

188
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,780
To think you'd talk to me like that...
That snot-nosed brat sure did grow a pair.

189
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,280
His crime was killing one of his crewmates.

190
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,590
That's the worst sin you
can commit on a pirate ship.

191
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,080
He broke the golden rule.

192
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,590
Once I let them board my ship,

193
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,960
they are all my sons,
no matter how foolish they are.

194
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,130
Where can my killed son's soul go?

195
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,150
It's my responsibility to show that idiot Teach

196
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:56,140
that you can't make your way in the
world if you lack a moral code, right?!

197
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,160
You got that, you idiot?!

198
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,270
It's 100 years too soon to tell me what to do.

199
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,410
No one will be able to stop...

200
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,250
...this reckless era!

201
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,460
It's nothing to fear!

202
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,840
I'm Whitebeard!

203
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,500
R-Red Hair, that bastard!
What's he doing to the old man?!

204
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,150
Hold on. He's not the type
to pull a stupid stunt.

205
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,020
But whatever discussion they
had seems to have fallen apart.

206
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,160
Look above.

207
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,120
The clouds have... No, the sky has been split!

208
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,910
Ahhh...!

209
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,790
Geez... Give it to me.

210
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,350
Hey!

211
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,800
Look! I got today's newspaper!

212
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,780
It's talking about Enies Lobby!

213
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,730
S-So it's finally in the news?!
Hey, what's it saying?!

214
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,480
It's an article that'll determine our fate!

215
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,480
--Well...
--W-Well?

216
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
It's not...

217
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,960
...talking about us at all.

218
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,740
Ahhh!

219
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,740
I knew it! We have no choice
but to leave this island!

220
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,830
Wait, what?! It's not talking about us?

221
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,410
R-Really?!

222
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,630
--Yeah!
--Not at all?! Is that possible?!

223
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,600
There's no mistake about it!

224
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,840
All right! I thought we had to
live life on the run! I'm so glad!

225
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,510
What's the deal, when the Franky
Family went on such a rampage?

226
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,800
Maybe your grandpa spun
the information by saying

227
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,360
that they were regular people
who got dragged into the incident?

228
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,940
Well, I don't think he'd even think of that.

229
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,480
I don't think he would, either.

230
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,450
I bet it's Aokiji who did it.
He's hard to figure out.

231
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,070
At any rate, that's good news.

232
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,910
We're pirates, but they're not.

233
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,070
If they had to live life on the run
from here on out, I'd feel bad.

234
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,420
Instead, they wrote terrible things about us.

235
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,440
According to this, we declared
war on the World Government.

236
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,510
Even burning down the island
was our doing, it says.

237
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,720
Looks like our bounties will go up again.

238
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,970
Whoa!

239
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,060
D-Do you think I'll get a bounty, too?!

240
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,520
Well, it's not impossible...

241
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,940
...but I'm the one who's gonna be in trouble.

242
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,200
"A superstar appears."

243
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,830
Why are you guys happy about it?!
Are you stupid or what?!

244
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,010
Bro, Iceberg is here.

245
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,090
He's here.

246
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,810
Working hard, Franky?

247
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,470
--Ribbit!
--Hm? What're you doing here?

248
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,100
Well, so what, you don't want
help from the likes of me?

249
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,430
Ha! Can you keep up with my ship design?

250
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,600
How about you? Do you still have the
skills after doing demolition for so long?

251
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,570
Show me the blueprints.

252
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,940
Everyone from Tom's Workers is here, huh?

253
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,380
You guys don't have to build a ship
in a place like this, you know.

254
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,120
I heard that it's a ship for the Straw Hats!

255
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,880
Is there something we can do to help?!

256
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,960
It's not good if you rush through it all
by yourself and do a sloppy job, so...

257
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,460
Well... You guys don't have
to work on the backstreets?

258
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,930
The others said that since they
couldn't come, at least we should go help,

259
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,890
if he was working on a
replacement for that pirate ship.

260
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,270
You guys are all...

261
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,370
What a nice story...

262
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,600
It is.

263
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,120
Don't stand in my way, okay?!

264
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,620
All right! We'll show you
the skills of those at Dock #1!

265
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,020
Huh?! What?!

266
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,920
Franky's building a ship for us?!

267
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,410
Oh, that's right. You were sleeping.

268
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,250
All right! I'm glad to hear that!

269
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,960
Oh, then, he's a nice guy after all!

270
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,130
--He's a nice guy! Yep, he's a nice guy!
--I'm looking forward to seeing the new ship!

271
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,300
--He's a nice guy!
--Well then, why don't I go
out shopping while we wait?

272
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,560
So when will that ship be finished?

273
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
When he came by yesterday,
he said he needed five days.

274
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,140
So, four more days.

275
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,490
I can't wait!

276
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,650
That's a strange dance.

277
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,290
Do you call that a dance?

278
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,250
Where did the 100 million
Berries we had in here go?

279
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,940
Oh, that. I gave it to them to buy meat
and booze and stuff for the party.

280
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,960
Gave it to them? It was our money!

281
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
It was our party, wasn't it?

282
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,890
Hey! We don't have much left!

283
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,280
Yeah, I can imagine! In the end,
everyone in town showed up!

284
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,120
It was a real blast!

285
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,620
Well...

286
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,710
...we got a good deal with the ship,
so there's no problem, right?

287
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,560
I wanted to get gorgeous furniture for the ship.

288
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,420
Let's go hunt for a bargain.

289
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,340
Oh, Nami! I'm gonna go out and have fun,
so give me some spending money.

290
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,180
@#$%&!!

291
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,770
You're not getting anything!

292
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,930
Yes, ma'am!

293
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,670
Boy, why does water-water
candy taste this good?!

294
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,340
It's the best, you jerk!

295
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,560
If I put it on top of cotton candy and eat it,
I don't know what'll happen to me!

296
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
S-Straw Hat!

297
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,890
--Hm?
--My... Um...

298
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,190
I have a favor to ask!

299
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

300
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,650
"A Girl in Search of Her Yagara!
Great Search in the City of Water!"

301
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,880
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
