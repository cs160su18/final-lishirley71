00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

arienai sekai wo iku nara

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

25

32

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230
Since the day that the dream began

54

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,190
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,980
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,610
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,410
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,080
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,080
This country will soon be destroyed.

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,750
And it will be rebuilt under a new king.

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,170
Namely, me!

83
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,550
Citizens of Fish-Man Island!

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,220
It's time to say goodbye...

85
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,930
...to the old Ryugu Kingdom!

86
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,350
Three hours from now, at Conchcorde Plaza,

87
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,650
I'm going to cut this
incompetent King's head off!

88
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,980
Straw Hat Pirates!

89
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,490
I'll show you something good.

90
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,780
I know you are somewhere on
the island watching this.

91
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,250
You people shattered Arlong's dream
- he was a symbol of Fish-Men's anger.

92
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,750
Zoro! Usopp! Brook!

93
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,670
--What fools...
--I can't believe they got caught!

94
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,300
--It's water!
--It's water!

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
That room will be filled with water by
the time we finish executing the King.

96
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,440
You lowly creatures can't
survive that, can you?

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,600
Shark! Take me to the Ryugu Palace!

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,770
I said "Wait," Luffy-kun!

99
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,570
Huh?

100
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,690
You people shouldn't fight Hordy!

101
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,110
Jimbei! They have my crew!

102
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,830
And I got to do something about Hordy
before my friends get into real trouble!

103
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,240
You're impossible!

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,620
Just shut up!

105
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,120
Stop me if you can!

106
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,840
I shouldn't let my guard down
just because we fought together.

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,300
I almost forgot that
you're that man's brother.

108
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,510
You ready to do this?

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,390
Kid?

110
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:44,400
"A Rift Opens Up!
Luffy vs. Jimbei!"

111
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,040
People called me The Submarine
of the East Blue when I was a kid.

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,920
I can easily swim even an 82-foot pool!

113
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,760
I can run that far!

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,510
I can't swim but I can run!

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,890
Hey, Brook! Let's see which one
of us is faster sometime soon!

116
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,850
You can't beat me! I'm going
to run beyond the horizon!

117
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,610
Anyway, it doesn't look good, does it?!

118
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,030
No, it doesn't! The surface of
the water is getting closer!

119
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,780
--Look, look! The water is...
--It's coming! It's coming!

120
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,450
Shut up!

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,660
What's your problem?!
How can you be so calm?!

122
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,210
Yeah! Do you have any ideas?!

123
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,330
Nope.

124
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,420
--Don't be so honest!
--That's so clear, I like it. Yeah...

125
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,840
If only I had my sword.

126
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,890
Sword? But...

127
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,050
I have no choice.

128
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,140
I have to do it in front of you two...

129
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,980
What is "it"?

130
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,060
Dorororororo...

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,110
Bone, bone, bone, bone...

132
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,150
Hey Brook, what are you doing?

133
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,490
Bone, bone, bone, bone...

134
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,320
Hey! Brook!

135
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Bang!

136
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,340
Boom!

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
I'm out!

138
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,090
What?!

139
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,970
Okay, see you!

140
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,970
Hey, w-wait, wait, wait!

141
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,770
You got some explaining to do!

142
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,770
You can do something like that now?

143
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,520
Yes, I can make my soul leave my body.

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,900
That's just like a real dead person.

145
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,690
Yes, you're right.

146
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,780
It happened when I was on
my world tour as Soul King...

147
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,450
I was in quite a slump
at that time for a while.

148
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:04,290
TDS SALES PLUMMET----
CONCERT TICKETS REMAIN UNSOLD

149
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,370
Sales of TDs and concert
tickets were dropping.

150
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,840
And I didn't know what to do.

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,670
Today's concert was not so great.

152
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,510
He's not making great music lately.

153
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,970
I couldn't feel his soul!

154
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,100
What happened to you, Brook?
Write a new song that will sell!

155
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,690
It's not that easy to make a hit song...

156
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,030
Music is something much more sublime.

157
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,820
Maybe... Maybe, the God of Music
doesn't love me anymore.

158
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,290
One more time... Just one more song is fine!

159
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,210
God! God of Music!

160
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,460
Bless me with a melody that will
shake everybody to their soul! God!

161
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,680
Boom!

162
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,770
What?! What is going on?!

163
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,360
Since I got this ability,
I noticed what's missing in my songs.

164
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,950
I found a way out of my slump!

165
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,160
--What was it?
--Well...

166
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,130
If you had the ability to pass
undetected through walls...

167
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,630
Any able-bodied male
understands the potential, right?

168
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,930
I'm jealous, Zoro! I wish I were him!

169
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,970
Shut up!

170
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,310
Oh, the water got that high!

171
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,520
Do something already!

172
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,200
Luffy-chin! Boss Jimbei!

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Luffy! Jimbei! Hold on a second!
What are you guys doing?!

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,290
I'm gonna go to the Ryugu Palace to save
my crew and kick that Hordy guy's ass!

175
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,800
I said "Don't do it"!

176
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Hey hey, why do you have to fight now?

177
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,470
Cut it out, guys!

178
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,010
Luffy-sama! Boss Jimbei-sama!

179
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,640
Shark! Take me! To the Ryugu Place!

180
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,190
I said "Wait"!

181
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,690
Outta my way!

182
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,730
Fish-Man Karate--Shark Brick Fist!

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,120
--What?!
--Luffy-chin!

184
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,030
Huh?!

185
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,040
Luffy-sama!

186
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,880
Ow... Ouch!

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,090
It worked?! He's supposed to be immune
to blows like that as a rubber man!

188
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,470
The Fish-Man Karate is all about
manipulating the water around you!

189
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,480
The shock wave can travel
through water vapor in the air

190
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,100
and through to the water
within your target's body!

191
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,610
Every living thing is made up of water.
So even a rubber man can't escape the impact!

192
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,080
Damn you!

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,540
I won't let you go, Luffy!

194
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,130
Second gear!

195
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,170
Gum-Gum...

196
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,510
...Jet Stamp!

197
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,100
Is this all you learned from your training?

198
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,810
Don't bet on it!

199
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,150
Enough.

200
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,650
Robin!

201
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,990
Robin-chan!

202
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,950
Hey, move aside, Robin!

203
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,910
Who are you?! Move!

204
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,580
Robin-chan's in danger!

205
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,560
Don't fight.

206
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,440
I don't know the reason but
you two are friends, right?

207
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,110
Huh?! Why did Robin come out of the forest?!

208
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,700
WATERWHEEL TOWN

209
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,990
Take this!

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,630
J-Just give up! You guys can't win!

211
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,300
No way. Didn't you see
Boss Hordy's broadcast?

212
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,220
This country will be destroyed.
And Neptune is gonna die!

213
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,390
What did you say?!

214
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,890
No!

215
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't kill them.

216
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,150
If you do so, you'll be no better than them!

217
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,570
B-But...

218
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,700
Ryuboshi, Manboshi, take them into custody.

219
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,370
--I got it-so-la-ti-do!
--Count on it!

220
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,290
You're as indulgent as before-dosun.

221
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,920
Does indulgence run in the
Neptune family's blood?

222
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:45,340
You are not just getting back at
humans but hurting your fellow beings.

223
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,180
Doesn't it pain your heart?!

224
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:53,640
Any Fish-Man who sides with
humans deserves death-dosun!

225
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,810
Lead the way for your
father--towards death! Fukaboshi!

226
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,820
Screw you!

227
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,840
Shit!

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,640
Dammit!

229
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,970
They did it!

230
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,390
They got the New Fish-Man Pirates!

231
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,270
Only the 3 great royal brothers could do it!

232
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,360
Prince Fukaboshi-sama!

233
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,110
Leave the rest up to us.

234
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,610
Thank you.

235
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's get to Conchcorde
Plaza to save our father!

236
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,080
All right. Let's go!

237
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Okay, let's go to the execution ground.

238
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,800
Do you want some of us to
stay here at the palace,

239
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,970
Boss Hordy?

240
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,970
No, I don't think so.

241
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,390
This Ryugu Palace is impregnable.

242
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,980
Leave some men to open the
gate when we come back.

243
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,690
We don't want the new
king getting locked out!

244
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,400
We sure don't!

245
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,980
That'd be nonsense-jamon!

246
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,740
You can't win citizens'
hearts with violence!

247
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,450
You have only a little
life left. Say what you want.

248
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,540
This hurts.

249
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,250
That stupid swordsman cut me there.

250
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,170
The drug is wearing off.
Hey, give me the Energy Steroid.

251
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,180
Y-Yes.

252
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,270
The pain is gone!

253
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,190
Is it okay to take that much at once?

254
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,230
I-I don't know.

255
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,030
Boss, what should we do
about those 3 Straw Hats?

256
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,450
They're just humans.
They'll drown if we leave them like that.

257
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,290
No matter who is coming to save them,
no one can break into the palace.

258
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,630
That aside, how are the new residents
from the Fish-Man District doing?

259
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,340
They're doing fine.

260
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,970
They're already moving.

261
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,180
That's good.
There'll be empty houses for them.

262
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,230
Some will leave the country
and the others will die.

263
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,440
They can just move into those houses.

264
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,820
We'll make a great country in which
all citizens can look down on humans.

265
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,620
I found it! The ray of hope!

266
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,540
Those Fish-Men that we saw earlier are
all gone and nobody is here in the palace

267
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,300
but they left Pappagu-san behind.

268
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,380
All right then, Brook,
ask Pappagu to find the key to unchain us.

269
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,180
--And the keys to this cage and this room...
--Wait a minute, fool!

270
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,850
Huh?

271
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:25,060
One of my swords is enough.
Just bring my sword.

272
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,770
I'll cut them all!

273
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,810
Wow, you're so reliable!

274
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,610
All right, I'll go ask Pappagu-san!

275
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,660
I-I'm scared!

276
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,460
What the hell? I thought we
were just invited to a banquet.

277
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,420
I wonder if those Straw Hats are doing okay.

278
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,880
Pappagu-san...

279
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,560
Huh? Huh?

280
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,980
--Pappagu-san...
--What? What?

281
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,530
I found you!

282
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,370
Boom!

283
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,370
I'm here!

284
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,790
A ghost!

285
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,340
Wait!

286
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,220
It's a ghost--I'm scared!

287
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,180
Pappagu-san! It's me!

288
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,520
I don't have much time! I need the
key... I mean, the sword! Hey, wait!

289
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,940
No, stay away!

290
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,360
--No!!
--What do you mean "No"? Listen to me! Wait!

291
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,840
Are you okay, you two? And Sanji?

292
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,760
Think about it, Luffy!

293
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,470
What will happen if you guys resort to
violence now on the Fish-Man Island?

294
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:31,560
Everytime Fish-Men tried to open their
hearts to humans, humans disappointed them.

295
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,230
"Humans are very violent."
"Humans hate and look down on Fish-Men."

296
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,160
What happened in the past planted those
twisted ideas in Fish-Men's minds.

297
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,370
In the case of Arlong,

298
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:54,420
many Fish-Men believe that humans
hunted him because he was a Fish-Man.

299
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,500
If you, the people who beat
Arlong, fight Hordy now,

300
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,880
what do you think will happen?

301
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Even if it helps the island
overcome this crisis,

302
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,560
witnessing you people knocking down
Hordy who is standing against humans...

303
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,270
...would make the islanders to think
that things will never change.

304
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,370
But, Jimbei,

305
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,040
we have to rescue our crew.

306
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,920
And if nothing is done,
Hordy will rule the Fish-Man Island.

307
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,630
We have so many friends on the island.

308
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,300
Hey, Hachi.

309
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,930
You've been trying so hard
to hide who did that to you

310
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,020
but you said a while ago...

311
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,320
...that Hordy attacks those Fish-Men
who are sympathetic to humans.

312
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,570
Did you get beaten by them
because you spoke up for us?

313
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,250
Hachi!

314
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,340
Hatchin, is that true?
Hordy and his crew did that to you?

315
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,960
I can't...

316
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,510
Jimbei!

317
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,260
I think part of the reason Luffy wants
to fight is because this is your home.

318
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,890
I heard that you helped our captain
when he had his back against the wall.

319
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,200
We can't thank you enough for that.

320
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,040
And if Luffy wants to fight,
we will go along with him!

321
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,920
We can't just leave the island like this.

322
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,670
We have reason to fight!

323
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,440
The reason is...

324
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,610
Camie-chan's here!

325
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,900
And Shirahoshi-chan's here!

326
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,660
Yes! This country is the
Mermaid paradise of my dreams!

327
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,420
Get out of my way, Jimbei!
You gotta let me go!

328
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,010
No, I won't! Leave it up to me!

329
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,060
You bastard!

330
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Then I'll just beat my way past you!

331
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,730
I'll fight you as many times as
I have to till you understand!

332
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,440
What did you say?!

333
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,900
Cut it out, guys!

334
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,380
Neptune's execution draws ever closer.

335
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,970
Hordy's powerful allies are mobilizing.

336
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,390
The New Fish-Man Pirates are overrunning
every part of Fish-Man Island.

337
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,480
But then, just as his ambition
is coming to fruition,

338
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,230
an terrifying change befalls Hordy!

339
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

340
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,020
"Something Has Happened to Hordy!
The True Power of the Evil Drug!"

341
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
