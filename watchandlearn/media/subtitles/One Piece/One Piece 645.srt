The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

burning, intense excitement!

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,710
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,750
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,620
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

74
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,160
When Luffy found out that the prize for a
fighting event was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,070
he decided to enter.

76
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,040
Finally, the match for Block C
which Luffy registered for, started!

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,310
Do you wanna fight me?

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,080
Oh, crap! Run, Ucy!

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,380
Ucy!

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,990
What a disappointment!

81
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,510
The Giant's been knocked down!

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,580
"Destruction Cannon Blasts!
Lucy in trouble!"

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,100
That was awesome, Lucy!

84
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,310
Can't help getting more excited as we go on!

85
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,710
He came in and stirred things up in Block C!

86
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,980
Lucy did it again!

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,040
Thank you for fighting together with me.

88
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,500
Let me carry you to the
side of the ring, Ucy.

89
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,690
I believe this guy still
has a lot more to show!

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,020
What else is new?

91
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,800
I can't believe it!
I didn't expect he'd be that strong!

92
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,040
Lucy!

93
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,970
Hey, Giant man! You're still in the ring.

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,480
If you wanna take a nap, you better get out!

95
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,790
You're in my way!

96
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Hajrudin's enormous body's been
blown up by an explosion?!

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,040
What just happened?!

98
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,620
No, it wasn't an explosion!

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,030
Hajrudin got eliminated

100
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,570
but there are still many tough ones in Block C!

101
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,480
That was an explosive punch
powered by some odd-shaped shoulders!

102
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,210
Ideo!

103
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,190
The one who blew away the

104
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,660
Giant's huge body was...

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,770
"DESTRUCTION CANNON" IDEO
AN XXX RANK BOXER

106
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,710
...the two-time champion of...

107
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,790
...the New World Central Fighting Tournament!

108
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,980
"Destruction Cannon" Ideo!

109
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,770
--Ideo's strong!
--Yeah, amazing!

110
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,100
Cut the "two-time champion" crap!

111
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,580
The past record from
other competitions doesn't matter!

112
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,370
You're right.

113
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,750
What matters is...

114
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,550
...how strong you are!

115
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,690
And I'm stronger than you.

116
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm gonna win this thing!

117
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,300
I'm gonna be the champion!

118
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,090
Meanwhile, elsewhere in Dressrosa...

119
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm so surprised!

120
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,170
You're unbelievably terrible with directions!

121
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,000
Shut up! It was just a slight mistake!

122
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,670
"Slight"?!  That wasn't "slight"!

123
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,140
You've gone in the opposite direction
from where I told you 27 times!

124
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,550
You ran down stairs that
you just climbed up 31 times!

125
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,170
It was not "slight" at all!

126
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,930
We're moving away from the Flower Field
rather than getting closer!

127
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,840
Pull yourself together!

128
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,900
Shut up! It's your fault
because you suck at leading the way!

129
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,740
No...

130
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
It's your fault!!

131
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,310
--What the...

132
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,550
He jumped up and fell down himself.

133
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,020
Ouch!
What do you think you're doing?!

134
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
What happened to him all of a sudden?

135
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,100
Who is he yelling at?

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,020
So creepy. Let's go.

137
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,840
I have to tell my people where the

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,230
members of the Don Quixote Family
are, as soon as possible!

139
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,100
So pull yourself together!

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,440
Don't you get it?!

141
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,170
You're gonna break my bones!

142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,040
You're too strong to lose control like that!

143
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,080
I have friends that I care about, too!

144
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,320
Stop complaining or
go ask some damn cat to carry you!

145
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,320
Hey!

146
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,480
This place looks familiar... Or not...

147
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,280
Is this...

148
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,870
Where am I?

149
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,450
You already got lost?

150
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,830
A-Are you some kind of idiot?!

151
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,410
Who are you calling an idiot?!

152
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,380
Please! Take me to my people!

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,090
All right.

154
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,260
You're going the wrong way!

155
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,330
Let's go!

156
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,190
Okay!

157
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,260
And at Green Bit...

158
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,540
Room!

159
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,750
Only a Warlord could do that.

160
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,960
Damn you, Fujitora. He's mine to kill.

161
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,320
Bullet String!

162
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,040
You wanna play tag, Law?

163
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,120
Let's chase them.

164
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes, sir!

165
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,020
I know what you're doing, Law.

166
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,610
You're trying to buy some time, aren't you?

167
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,290
I'm not gonna let you have it your way.

168
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,260
Lucy and Ideo's one-on-one fight!

169
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,990
This should be an interesting match-up!

170
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,130
Take this!

171
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,180
What the... Your punch is like a bomb.

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,350
I'm not satisfied with my power yet.

173
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,740
I want to get to the top of the ladder!

174
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,630
So I want to be stronger!

175
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,830
By eating the prize of this competition -
the Flare-Flare Fruit!

176
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,170
I'm not gonna let you have Ace's fruit.

177
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,270
I will win it!

178
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,740
No, I'm gonna be the champion!

179
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,500
This is hot!

180
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,450
What a breathtakingly heated battle!

181
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,920
But that's not the only fight
you want to keep an eye on!

182
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,690
Now, take a look!

183
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,850
Those three gangs from the
Kano Kingdom in the far east

184
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,670
are very unique, too!

185
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,630
It's no use!

186
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,570
There you go!

187
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,080
You can't protect yourself from it!

188
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,740
SAI - THE 13TH LEADER OF THE HAPPO NAVY -
A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

189
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,500
The Eight-Impact Fist that allows

190
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,950
them to manipulate an impact!

191
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,350
Shields and armor are useless against them!

192
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,950
With centuries of history,

193
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,960
the Happo Navy is...

194
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:42,360
BOO - THE VICE LEADER OF THE HAPPO NAVY -
A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

195
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,380
...just unbeatable!

196
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,340
If we can kill you,

197
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,290
it's almost as big a prize as
winning this competition, Chinjao!

198
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,260
Boy...

199
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,630
Go home and train yourselves more
before coming back, punks!

200
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,620
FORMERLY THE 12TH LEADER
OF THE HAPPO NAVY (RETIRED)
- A GANG FROM THE KANO KINGDOM

201
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,480
DON CHINJAO

202
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,790
That was Conqueror's Haki!

203
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,100
No wonder!

204
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,900
He used to be a pirate
worth 500 million! He's the legend!

205
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,670
There is only one man that I want to fight!

206
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,200
Don't get in my way!

207
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,990
Thank you, Chinjao!

208
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,380
There are so many nice weapons to pick up!

209
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,140
Whoa!

210
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,120
That man didn't get beaten
by Don Chinjao's Haki

211
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,540
and he's now picking up weapons in the ring!

212
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,010
JEAN ANGO AKA JEAN THE BANDIT
A BOUNTY HUNTER

213
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,970
He is a dark horse in this competition -

214
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,020
Jean the Bandit!

215
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,740
A bounty hunter that all big-time pirates

216
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,200
in the New World
hold a grudge against!

217
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,330
Wait, you shithead!

218
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,200
Now that I found you, your number is up!

219
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,070
I won't forgive you
for sending my partner to prison!

220
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,930
These weapons that
I picked up will make nice bullets.

221
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,150
I'm a sniper after all!

222
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,450
If that partner guy was so important to you,

223
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,380
you should've shown your
mettle by raiding the prison!

224
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,690
Like the idiot who actually did it
a couple years ago.

225
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,090
Hey! That guy has already passed out!

226
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,000
How much more is he gonna punch him?!

227
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,680
Hey, stop, brother!
He's already knocked out!

228
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,010
That's enough!

229
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,530
I restrained the wrong person.

230
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,090
This bastard! He called me shorty!

231
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,850
THE FUNK BROTHERS
ASSASSINS FROM THE MOGARO KINGDOM

232
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,020
Hey, Bobby, am I a shorty?! Huh?!

233
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,100
No, you're not! You're a big man!

234
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,370
Say something, you dickhead!

235
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,240
Brother! That's enough!

236
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,060
I restrained the wrong person.

237
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,670
KELLY FUNK
THE OLDER OF THE TWO BROTHERS

238
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,630
If I ever hear you say it again,

239
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,860
I'll gouge your eyes out!

240
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,620
Don't keep trying to stop me, Bobby!

241
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,540
BOBBY FUNK
THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO BROTHERS

242
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,550
But this is a competition, brother.

243
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,510
The Funk Brothers are so brutal!

244
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,560
They're assassins well known
in the underground community!

245
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,200
I heard they're very powerful fighters and

246
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,900
they even killed some pirates
worth over a 100 million!

247
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,560
I don't care if it's a competition
or not! I'm not short!

248
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,560
How annoying.

249
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,490
He's just an untrained amateur boxer.

250
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,570
Let's see what you got!

251
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,520
Hey, shrimp!

252
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,490
What did you just say?!

253
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,590
Brother!

254
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,030
What?!

255
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,560
How weak!

256
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,920
I mean, maybe the Happo
Navy people are too strong!

257
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,030
What a disappointment!

258
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,320
You're not a powerful fighter
at all, you idiot! You fool!

259
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,640
Gyats-san!

260
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,540
That was easy!

261
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,850
You're next, younger brother!

262
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,500
Wait! I won't fight.

263
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,920
I've never got into a
fight in my entire life!

264
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,590
Go to hell!

265
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,600
He turned his back?!
These brothers are the worst!

266
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,030
The ax is broken!

267
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,000
This was not just some ax!
It was infused with Armament Haki!

268
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,840
His body is strong!

269
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,530
Brother.

270
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,110
Th-That bastard called me shrimp.

271
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,290
Just put it on already, Bobby!

272
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,740
What?

273
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,120
Okay.

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,470
Oh, damn!

275
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,700
Wait!

276
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,610
What's going on?!

277
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,170
Boo!

278
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,850
Boo from the Kano Kingdom
is taking quite a beating!

279
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,680
He's already passed out!

280
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,990
Who's punching him?!
Is that the wimpy younger brother - Bobby?!

281
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,430
Or the weak older brother - Kelly?!

282
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,880
I guess that's the older one!

283
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,730
He got bigger and looks like a different man!

284
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,200
Who did you call shrimp?
If I ever hear you say it again,

285
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,740
I will chew a hole in your throat!

286
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,480
Wow! Lucy's helmet got knocked off!

287
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,290
Hey, give it back!

288
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,590
I heard this strange story, Lucy.

289
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,290
I heard a pirate who's worth 400 million
named Straw Hat Luffy is...

290
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,050
...secretly fighting in this competition.

291
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,800
Straw Hat Luffy!

292
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,640
Don Chinjao is charging at something!

293
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,710
Garp, watch me!

294
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,080
I'm gonna kill your grandson!

295
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,390
Block C! There are approximately
40 contenders remaining!

296
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,830
It's narrowing down to the strongest!

297
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,040
Who's gonna win this?!
