00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,540
Sogeking, who was left alone
at the main island front gate,

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,040
heard something shocking from
one of the giant gatekeepers.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,080
One day on some island...

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,920
...the two bosses started a duel.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,380
It's a big fat lie that they
got caught 50 years ago!

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,870
"Main Island Front Gate"

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,070
Meanwhile, just when the courthouse
came into view for the Straw Hats

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,260
"Courthouse"

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,020
on the back of the King Bull...

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,480
Crap! King Bull!

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,980
Sodom!

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,530
Sodom! Stand firm! Don't fall yet!

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,390
Guys! Move over right away! Hurry it up!

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,750
It's coming down!

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,710
Around that time, Luffy and Blueno were
facing off on the courthouse rooftop.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,710
"Courthouse"

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,560
So Robin is in that building behind you, huh?

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,550
Get out of my way, bull guy!

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,180
It seems that you guys haven't noticed...

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,600
...that what you're doing is a world-class crime.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,520
Hm?

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,450
The Government will expose
all of you to public ridicule

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,690
and bestow a merciless death upon you.

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,150
Gum-Gum...

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,860
Iron Body.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,820
...Rifle!

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,530
What?! I don't remember him
being as powerful as he is now

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,180
when I fought him at the mansion!

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,470
Gatling!

31
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,760
Shave!

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,500
We just came here to get Robin back!

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,630
The battle against CP9 has finally begun!

34
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,890
That's...

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,390
Geez... They're reckless, aren't they?

36
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,490
Grandma! Grandma!

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,630
Hm?

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,570
What is it, Chimney?

39
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,550
Listen... Listen!

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,950
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Let's cross this endless sea to go in search of

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
a global miracle no one
has yet been able to find

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,770
With our hearts pounding,
we'll just charge ahead as we please

44
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:35,440
following the footprints of
those who chase their dreams

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,400
No matter how stormy the night,
if we join our hearts as one,

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,780
we will be able to make it through

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
Always!

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,620
Get running, get running,
holding our flag high in the sky

49
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,590
Even though there are tears
we don't want anyone to see

50
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,730
Chase it, chase it,
if we want to achieve our dream,

51
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,220
we should always look
straight ahead without fear

52
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,600
We can't stop here

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,560
Around the world

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,770
Start me up!

55
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,670
Get running, get running,
head past everyone else

56
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,840
So long as we don't run from it,
we can grasp tomorrow in our hands

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,580
Chase it, chase it,
everything we see before us,

58
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,760
let's carve it into the blank pages of our hearts

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,570
Brand New World

60
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,720
Start me up!

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:05:01,020
"Don't Stop! Hoist the Counterattack Signal!"

62
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,280
"Courthouse" "Rocketman"

63
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,700
It's coming! Aim well!

64
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,300
Let it get closer!

65
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,170
That's a trench mortar! Dodge it, Gomorrah!

66
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,430
This center path isn't good. They're fully
prepared and waiting in ambush!

67
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,890
We're gonna change the route!

68
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,860
We're not gonna let you get away!

69
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,660
Sodom...

70
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,640
Stop right there!

71
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,030
Chopper...

72
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,700
Hm?! The portable
transponder snail is ringing?!

73
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,140
Hello? Who is it?

74
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,640
It's me.

75
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,810
That's Granny Kokoro.

76
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,100
What're you calling for?

77
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,440
Sounds like you guys are still alive.
Where are you right now?

78
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,450
We're getting closer to the courthouse. Why?

79
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,370
Good timing. There's something
I forgot to tell you.

80
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,250
Something you forgot to tell us?

81
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,550
I'm sure you guys are busy,
so I'll make it quick. Listen carefully.

82
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,070
On the map drawn by Paulie,

83
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,750
there's no path from the courthouse
to the Gates of Justice, right?

84
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,630
That's right. I was just thinking about that.

85
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,700
Look at the courthouse.
There's a tower on each side, right?

86
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,890
Yeah, there is.

87
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,850
There's a lever on the top floor of each tower.

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,250
When you pull them,
a drawbridge will come down

89
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,360
from the courthouse to the Gates of Justice.

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
Granny, how come you know that stuff?

91
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,630
I came here with Tom-san to
fix the bridge a long time ago.

92
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,990
That damn ungrateful, stupid Government!

93
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,150
Don't take it out on me.

94
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,700
Chimney wants to talk to you, too.

95
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,330
Hello, pirate lady! Can you hear me?

96
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,160
Whoa! What is it, Chimney?

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,180
Listen. I saw the rubber pirate guy
on the rooftop of the courthouse.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,470
Really?! Luffy was there?

99
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,930
I saw rocks collapsing there, too,
so it looks like he's going on a rampage.

100
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,140
On the rooftop? Got it. Thanks.

101
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,900
Pirate girl, keep the
transponder snail connected

102
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,230
so that I'll know what's going on over there.

103
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,360
Okay...!

104
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,230
So they said.

105
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,610
Now we know where we have to go.

106
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,950
Yeah!

107
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:00,160
All right, you guys go straight to
the courthouse and join Straw Hat.

108
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay.

109
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,660
We're gonna split into two
and bring the drawbridge down.

110
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,090
Take us to the courthouse, Gomorrah!

111
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Gomorrah!

112
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,280
Dammit! Who are they?!

113
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:56,130
"Guilty"

114
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,130
Not gonna be that easy... you damn trash.

115
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,480
All right! The second one is down, too!

116
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,860
The pirates no longer have
a way of getting around!

117
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,730
Surround them and bring them down!

118
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,490
To all the guards in Enies Lobby!

119
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,950
At the center of Block D in the southeast area,

120
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,910
we brought down the King Bull
that the pirates were riding on!

121
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,680
Call in all the soldiers
and fully blockade Block D!

122
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,870
I repeat! All guards, fully blockade Block D!

123
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,900
Looks like the jury delivered the verdict.

124
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,590
No one can beat them.

125
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,090
Say something!

126
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,680
--Yes, sir!
--We'll capture them right away!

127
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,640
"Courthouse"

128
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,450
The guards that we passed are
now catching up. This isn't good.

129
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,770
More and more are coming
from the front and the sides.

130
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,190
The trench mortars are aiming at us, too.

131
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,200
Ahhh! This is terrible!
There are thousands of them!

132
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,450
If we get surrounded by them in
a place like this, we'll be goners!

133
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,370
"Courthouse" "Rocketman"

134
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,840
What?! An earthquake?

135
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,850
Th-They're...

136
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,930
Amazing!

137
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,110
Hey, look!

138
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,950
All right! Oimo and Kashii are back in business!

139
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,670
Oh, no...

140
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,400
We don't have much energy
left to fight guys like them.

141
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,960
Is this it for us?!

142
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,600
Hurry up and stomp on them!
Take care of those three, giants!

143
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,890
Go, Kashii!

144
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,200
Beat the crap out of them, Oimo!

145
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,030
Now, crush those three, giants!

146
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,040
How...

147
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,610
...dare you...

148
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,420
Huh?

149
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,090
...deceive us?!

150
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,520
Wh-What the heck?! Those two
went over to the enemy's side!

151
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,310
Before we rejoice over
the safety of our bosses...

152
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,770
Before we grieve over our wasted years...

153
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,390
We'll take out all our anger
on them in a furious rampage!

154
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,640
Let's go together... king of snipers!

155
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,260
No need for formality! Hoist the
counterattack signal this time for sure!

156
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,790
Hurry to our comrades!

157
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,900
You're a lucky person.

158
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,490
Most people don't get a
rescue squad, you know.

159
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,700
Refrain from talking!

160
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,660
Got it!

161
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:56,100
Well, it's not like I'm jealous that my
underlings aren't here to rescue me.

162
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,680
Oh, wait a minute, you guys.
I forgot something.

163
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,610
Take these with you.

164
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,530
Ahh! Wait a sec! Those are Devil Fruits!

165
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,330
Yoyoi! Is that...

166
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,460
...true?!

167
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,420
Chapapa...

168
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,340
I've never seen them before!

169
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,580
Me neither!

170
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,880
This is bad! Keep them away from me!

171
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,510
What's the big fuss, Jabra?

172
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,880
You idiot! You don't know?!

173
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,250
Those with Devil Fruit powers have
a devil dwelling in their bodies!

174
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,980
For example, if I get closer to one of the Fruits,

175
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,950
a devil jumps out of the Fruit and starts
fighting the devil inside my body,

176
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,490
which then causes my body to explode!

177
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,320
Is that true?

178
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,940
How foolish...

179
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,730
It takes a pretty sloppy intelligence
agent to be misled by a rumor.

180
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,300
Grand Line scientists have already clarified

181
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,970
the transmission conditions
of the Fruits' powers.

182
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,610
What you're talking about is an example
of those who have eaten two Fruits...

183
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,850
...in which case, the person dies
because his body bursts into pieces.

184
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,920
Greedy idiots bring ruin upon themselves.

185
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,770
If they think about the risk that
they carry with just one Fruit,

186
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,280
you'd think that they could
guess how much of a curse

187
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,820
the second one would bring them.

188
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,780
Coo coo!

189
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,190
What?! Is that right?!

190
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,200
In any case, I'm surprised that you were
able to obtain two Devil Fruits, Chief.

191
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,450
Where on earth did you get them?

192
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,410
I have all sorts of connections.

193
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,500
Eat them to prepare for the future.

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,590
Become stronger, CP9!

195
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,130
But let me tell you one thing.

196
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,050
I don't know what kind of
devils dwell in those Fruits.

197
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,140
It's hard to believe that these
are fruits from this world.

198
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,900
I feel a mysterious power,
kind of like gravity, from them.

199
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,930
They're not listed in encyclopedias, either.

200
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,480
That seems to be how they normally are.

201
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,000
It's said that you can tell the name
of the Fruit from the powers you gain,

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,400
but what kind of powers you'll gain is a gamble.

203
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,700
It'll be a terrible life if you gain
weird powers with this gamble.

204
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,620
On top of that, to think that
you'll become unable to swim...

205
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,230
No matter what powers they are,
it all depends on how you use them.

206
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,920
In all likelihood, you won't become weaker.

207
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,140
There's no inconvenience in
becoming unable to swim, either.

208
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,340
There are tons of sailors who'd sail out

209
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,640
to find just one Devil Fruit
and die without any success.

210
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,430
Why don't you eat them? It's interesting.

211
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,690
Kalifa, don't do it!
Nothing good will come of this.

212
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,980
It tastes like crap. Crap!

213
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,820
Jabra doesn't want Kaku and Kalifa
to get stronger. Chapapa...

214
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:18,680
That's right! Jealousy hurts a man's name.

215
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,660
Yoyoi!

216
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,050
Shut up, you jerks!

217
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,330
Hey, you two! Think about it carefully!

218
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,600
If you sell them in the right way, you can
get several hundred million Berries!

219
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,300
One bite of Fruit will become a
problem for the rest of your life!

220
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,980
Chapapa...

221
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,420
That sounds interesting.

222
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,820
If this is a winner, I'll welcome it.

223
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,200
Ahh! They ate them, dammit!

224
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,790
Coo coo! Coo coo!

225
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,910
Chapapa...

226
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,590
What's the matter?!

227
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:18,550
Yoyoi! Have you noticed
any changes in your body?!

228
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,050
Chapapa...

229
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,320
This tastes terrible.

230
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,650
Couldn't you say that sooner?!

231
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,740
It tastes terrible.

232
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,570
We've already heard that. Chapapa!

233
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,200
Don't say it after you ate the whole thing!

234
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,170
Hey, try doing something!
What kind of powers did you get?!

235
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,960
I don't feel like anything changed.

236
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,410
You'll soon notice how big the change is.

237
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,210
This is the birth of new
Devil Fruit power-holders.

238
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,910
I look forward to seeing those powers.

239
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,180
Get a handle on your own powers
at least, while you have a chance.

240
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Depending on the Chief's command,

241
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,390
you may be able to try them
in a real battle immediately...

242
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,240
...though it seems that Blueno couldn't
wait and joined the festivities before us.

243
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,230
"Courthouse"

244
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,720
I underestimated you.

245
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,050
Don't!

246
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,260
I never thought that he'd
keep up with the speed of Shave.

247
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,720
I'll fight with my guard up.

248
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,680
Since he's a rubber man,
hitting him wouldn't work, right?

249
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,150
Moon Walk!

250
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,570
Gum-Gum...

251
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,150
Tempest Kick!

252
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,450
Iron Body!

253
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,370
Wheel!

254
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,670
Door-Door!

255
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,260
A-A door just opened on the ground!

256
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,540
Door-Door.

257
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,350
Wh-What the heck?!
Were there small doors here?!

258
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,900
Crap! I got stuck! Dammit! These things...

259
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,500
You! What's this?! What'd you do?!
Is this a Devil Fruit power?!

260
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,280
I'm a Door human with
Door-Door Devil Fruit powers.

261
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
A Door human?!

262
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,950
I can change all things that partition into doors!

263
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,130
Revolving Door.

264
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,840
What?! What?!
Wh-What's going on?! I feel dizzy!

265
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,220
Wh-Wh-Which way is forward?! Stop!

266
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,600
Tempest Kick!

267
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,910
Hey, Cook!

268
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,740
Yeah, I saw it.

269
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,700
Luffy's already fighting CP9.

270
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,370
--What?!
--I-Is that true?!

271
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,080
Dammit! We got off to a late start!

272
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,690
But how do we get through
this complete encirclement?!

273
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,050
Gomorrah was hit with iron balls
and can no longer move!

274
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,340
Fire! Shoot all the pirates
down from the monster!

275
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,280
There's only one path left!

276
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,540
Yeah, we're gonna make
a dash for the courthouse!

277
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,150
That's the only choice we have.

278
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,490
All right, let's go, guys!

279
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,990
--Yeah!
--Wait!

280
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,530
All of you, don't get off!

281
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,160
Chopper?!

282
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,170
Hold on tight!

283
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,470
Gomorrah... Gomorrah says so!

284
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,020
Th-The monster is...

285
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,360
...still alive!

286
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Fire! Kill it with trench mortars!

287
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,780
Shoot the monster!

288
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,360
Fight back! Back up Gomorrah!

289
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,710
Go! Gomorrah!

290
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,260
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

291
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,180
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

292
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,310
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

293
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,310
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

294
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,570
We'll become No. 1

295
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,440
We'll aim for freedom in wonderland

296
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,650
Look, there's a faint light
showing us the road to tomorrow,

297
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,820
an era created by risking everything

298
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,950
We always try our best, let's go!

299
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,950
If we want to achieve glory,

300
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,330
now is the time--don't be afraid

301
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,250
We'll surely win the future
together with friends

302
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,210
Now, we start running faster
towards the vast world

303
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,210
We can take off with unknown powers

304
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,470
We don't fear, and we don't waver

305
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,180
No matter what happens,
in the end we'll surely...

306
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,220
We fight harder against
the wall that confronts us

307
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,190
We charge ahead stronger
with overflowing power

308
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,440
We won't fear even if we
have to give up everything

309
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Charge ahead

310
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
Let's start running towards tomorrow

311
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,530
Because it's all to ensure we smile in the end

312
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,680
I have a report! The pirates who invaded

313
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,560
have pushed into the courthouse plaza!

314
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,080
Our casualties are already over 2,000!

315
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Huh? What do you mean?

316
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,530
This is the worst situation we've
had in the history of Enies Lobby!

317
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,300
What the hell is happening
on this island right now?!

318
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

319
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,140
"Almost to Luffy!
Gather at the Courthouse Plaza!"

320
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
