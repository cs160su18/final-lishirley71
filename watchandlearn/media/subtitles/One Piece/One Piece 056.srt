00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,480
Hey, Apis! Who're you talking to?

22
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,640
No! Don't come here!

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,260
Didn't Lost Island sink
a long long time ago?

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,220
Grandpa Ryu says that the
island will surface again.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,820
But he doesn't seem to remember
clearly where it is and there's no clue.

26
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,100
He was separated from
his friends and lost his energy.

27
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,810
I want to take him back to his
home no matter what it takes.

28
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,440
He always tells me that he'll
get his energy back for sure

29
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,740
once he goes back to the dragons' nest.

30
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,470
So I'll definitely find it for him.

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,560
Okay then! I'll take him...

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,730
...to Lost Island!

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,980
Luffy! Were you listening?!
Lost Island sank into the sea!

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,090
But since the legendary
Millennial Dragon actually exists,

35
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,900
I'm sure Lost Island also exists somewhere!

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
An island that's not even on a map?

37
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,710
Yeah, that's why we're going!

38
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,600
"Eric Attacks! Great Escape
from Warship Island!"

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,610
It's hot!

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,970
Hm?

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,190
Wh... What the heck is that?!

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,030
The Navy again?!

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,770
Hey everyone! This is so cool!

44
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,770
What's going on here...?

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,910
And, the 1,201st King was...

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,740
Geez... The story isn't over yet?

47
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,960
Hey, listen to me.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,450
Ugh!

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,960
What? Is it morning already?

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,340
I dozed off since the old
man's story was so long...

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,640
Th-There's a problem!
Bokuden-san! Where's Apis?!

52
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,140
What's the matter?

53
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,640
Ah, you guys're pirates, right?

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,400
A Navy Fleet started blocking the harbor!

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,860
It can't be... Just to capture Apis...?

56
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,590
Why are they after a girl like that?

57
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,430
Hey! Everyone, come with me!

58
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,550
Certainly, Nami-san!

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,780
Why?

60
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,100
Just do it!

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,640
What do we do with the old man?

62
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,060
Looks like he's sound asleep,
so let's let him be.

63
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,330
Hey, when Bokuden-san wakes up,

64
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,870
please tell him that we'll protect Apis.

65
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,550
O-Okay.

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Their ship is on the starboard bow!

67
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,810
Okay! The landing unit will
come to Warship Island with me!

68
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,200
The rest of the crew
is to seize their ship!

69
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,700
Hi everyone!

70
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,780
This is the Millennial Dragon
Grandpa Bokuden was talking about.

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,630
See?! Isn't he cool?!

72
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,720
Don't talk like he's yours!

73
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,030
When you get closer to the Grand Line
you run into things like this, huh?

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,050
Since there're Sea Kings as well,
I guess this is possible...

75
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,110
I-Is he really harmless?!

76
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,460
Ah! He can be senile sometimes,

77
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,840
so if he acts like you're food, get away!

78
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,500
It's too late!

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,640
But it doesn't hurt, right?

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,690
I guess you call it soft-mouth?

81
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,600
Wh-Wh-What're you saying?!
He's not a puppy.

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,340
Let him eat you like that!

83
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,660
Zoro!!

84
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't! He'll have food poisoning.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,060
What'd you say, you damn love cook?!

86
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,670
What the Navy is after
is this Millennial Dragon.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,870
Frankly, the reason I brought you here

88
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,820
is that we'd like to bring this
Millennial Dragon back to Lost Island.

89
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,860
Wh-What're you saying?!
The Navy is closing in on us!

90
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,460
We're gonna have enough
trouble just getting away,

91
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,970
how in the heck could we
take such a big creature...?

92
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,760
Grandpa Ryu... wants to go home...

93
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,590
So...

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,440
Don't tell me, Luffy,

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,480
that you promised her, like,
"Yeah! I'll bring him home"...

96
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
Yeah, I promised and said,
"I'll bring him home."

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Don't do that!

98
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,140
We don't know where that island is, right?!

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,990
How are we supposed to get there?!

100
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,950
If we go, it'll work out somehow.

101
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,710
As if!

102
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,630
I thought Grandpa Ryu would get his
energy back once he goes home...

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,810
Animals have a migration instinct.

104
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,360
This Millennial Dragon may know something.

105
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,580
Yeah. Let's find Lost Island!

106
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,430
But...

107
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,860
Well, things will probably
work out, don't you think?

108
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,950
Zoro...

109
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,770
That's fine, but what
are we gonna do with him?

110
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,250
Just bringing him down the mountain
alone will be a lot of work.

111
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,520
First, build a cart!

112
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,550
A big enough one for Grandpa Ryu to ride.

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,070
Ahhh...

114
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,860
All right!!

115
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,220
Gum-Gum Gatling!!

116
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,720
Is this enough?

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,880
Yeah. A-Okay!

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
Since you did all this,
I guess I have no choice...

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,530
I'll do it. All right, I'll do it!

120
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,200
Phew! I guess this is it.

121
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,960
This thing won't break even
when Grandpa Ryu rides it!

122
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,990
Yeah!

123
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,960
But the harbor is blocked
by the Navy, right?

124
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,160
What will we do with the ship?

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,250
Isn't it gonna work out?

126
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,360
No, it won't.

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,340
Shall we make a raid?

128
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,750
Yeah, good idea.

129
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,760
That's not gonna work
since we have Grandpa Ryu.

130
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,380
I have an idea about how
we can carry him out of here.

131
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,080
By the way,
I want the Going Merry

132
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,350
to be brought to
the rear of the island.

133
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,320
Okay! It's the precious ship
that Kaya gave us. I'll do it.

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,740
He's so cool!

135
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,200
However... Zoro comes with me!

136
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
Me too?!

137
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,880
Then I'll leave it to you guys.

138
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,690
Okay! So...

139
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,330
...how about we wait until nightfall?

140
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,370
No!

141
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,990
Bring the ship to the edge of the cape
that looks like Usopp's nose.

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,970
You're right! That's Usopp's nose.

143
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,940
So what're we gonna do?
Just bringing the ship won't...

144
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,960
Don't worry about it.

145
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,930
I don't think they'd find
this place so easily...

146
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,480
...but in any case, hurry up.

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,530
What?! Doing things on a
hit-or-miss basis like that isn't...

148
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,650
Sanji-kun, Luffy!
Put Grandpa Ryu on the cart.

149
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,380
--Okay!
--Okay, Nami-san!

150
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,650
Hey, old man!
Where are you hiding this girl?

151
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,800
Hey!! Wake up!!

152
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,480
Oh... Did I already talk
about the 1,201st King?

153
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,760
Wh-What are you talking about?

154
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,520
Lt. Commander!!

155
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,250
There're tracks from something
being dragged in the backyard!

156
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,760
Eric! Did you find anything?!

157
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,020
These tracks must've been made by them.

158
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,530
They should be hiding
somewhere in the mountain.

159
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,110
Okay! We'll track them down!

160
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,470
Ahhh... This is why I suggested
that we wait until night.

161
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,950
What're you doing?!

162
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,830
I'll go on ahead.

163
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,180
Hm...?

164
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,640
Ahhh!

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,610
Ahhh! Meh mound me!

166
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,260
It's them!

167
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,850
Don't let him escape! Fire!

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,500
Zoro!!

169
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,620
What?!

170
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,330
Th-There was another one?

171
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,100
Stop! Stop!

172
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,930
Stop! Or we'll fire!

173
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,460
Stop!!

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,240
Wh... What?! Are they going to ram us?!

175
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,540
Maht?! Mis is mad!!

176
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,360
It's gonna ram us!

177
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,690
Furl the sails!

178
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,950
It's too late now!!

179
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,500
Prepare to set sail!

180
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,390
Yes, sir!!

181
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,330
Hoist the anchor!!

182
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,010
Furl the sails!!

183
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,010
Go after that pirate ship!!

184
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,120
Yes, sir!!

185
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,820
Here they come!

186
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,320
W-We've got trouble!

187
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
The bird said that the
Navy is getting close!

188
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,550
Oh... They came sooner than I thought...

189
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,950
Hey, what're you going to do now?

190
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,480
Ahh, you don't have to worry

191
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,470
because we have these two.

192
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,350
Once the Going Merry
is at Usopp's Nose Cape,

193
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,690
we'll go all the way down.

194
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,440
That brat is up there.

195
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,220
Wh-What's that?

196
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,810
I-It's a monster!

197
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,320
I finally found Dragonite,
the elixir of immortality!

198
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,470
Don't panic!

199
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,650
That's the Millennial Dragon
we've been looking for!

200
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,650
We'll get closer to them without being
noticed and capture it in one shot!

201
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,610
Yes, sir!!

202
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,770
Dammit! After we went through
all that trouble to escape...!

203
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,850
We haven't yet.

204
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,420
Ahhhh!

205
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,670
Don't let them get away!
Capture them without fail!

206
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,300
Ahhh! Zoro! Zoro! Zoro! Zoro!

207
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
T-T-Take care of the sail!

208
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,350
Got it! Leave it to me!

209
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,770
Dammit! Their ship is big, but it's fast!

210
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,830
No!! Don't shoot Grandpa Ryu!

211
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,620
Apis!

212
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,070
Grandpa Ryu!

213
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,970
As I thought, that brat had something
to do with the Millennial Dragon...

214
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,630
...although I didn't think that I'd be
able to encounter a real live dragon.

215
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,430
I no longer care about that brat.

216
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,410
That dragon is the elixir of
immortality that we've been looking for!

217
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,230
Fire!

218
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,030
Stop it!

219
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,910
No use!!

220
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,020
Wh-What the heck...?!

221
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,380
Th-The bullets definitely...!

222
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,880
So you have powers of a devil fruit.

223
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,220
That's right. I'm a rubber person.

224
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,300
R-Rubber person...!

225
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,470
D-Devil fruit...?

226
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,210
What's that?

227
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,320
Use...

228
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,610
Use swords!

229
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,180
Guns don't work against rubber!

230
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,560
Sanji-kun!

231
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,020
Yes, Nami-san!

232
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,570
Gum-Gum Gatling!

233
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,640
You call yourselves the Navy?

234
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,040
Really, you guys are good for nothing.

235
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,580
Hm?

236
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,880
--What was that?
--A knife?

237
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,190
My name is Eric the Whirlwind.

238
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,650
I'm a mercenary hired by Nelson Royal.

239
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,450
We don't have any business
with you pirates.

240
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,570
We have some business
with that Millennial Dragon.

241
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,260
If you stand in my way,

242
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,310
I'll make you a victim of my wind slash,
the power of the Sickle-Sickle Fruit.

243
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,030
--Hey, he said Sicko Sicko...
--Surprised?

244
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,110
--Sicko?
--I have the power of a devil fruit, too.

245
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,980
--What should we do?
--I have the power of a devil fruit, too.

246
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,910
--What shall we do?
--I have the power of a devil fruit, too.

247
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,130
Nami!

248
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,590
Do we have to keep going?

249
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,450
A little bit longer!

250
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,050
Nami-san's lovely even when
she looks at the distant ocean.

251
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,820
Just hurry up.

252
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,010
Hey! You bastards!

253
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,340
Are you listening to me?!

254
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,490
You're Eric the Sicko, right?
We're listening.

255
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,240
That's not right!

256
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,150
I didn't say sicko, I said sickle,
like the one that slices!!

257
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,700
We're sicko talking about this!
Just kidding!

258
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,410
Hope you don't regret making me angry.

259
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,080
Sickle-Sickle...

260
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,250
Whirlwind!

261
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:31,920
Ow!

262
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,340
What was that?

263
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,180
I see. A wind slash, huh?

264
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,340
The winds I create are as sharp
as legendary swords.

265
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,030
No matter how trained you are,

266
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,030
it's easy for me to tear you apart.

267
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,730
Aren't we going yet?

268
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
No. Not yet!

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,700
Now, out of my way!

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,290
Hand over the Millennial Dragon!

271
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,430
No way!

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,700
Do you wanna experience the
Sickle-Sickle Whirlwind again?

273
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,330
Aren't we going yet, Nami-san?!

274
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,290
Here they come! They're here!

275
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,590
Now! Sanji-kun! Luffy!

276
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,210
Okay, Nami-swan!

277
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,560
What?!

278
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,210
We'll be right there!

279
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,890
Nami-san! I'll be your love catapult!

280
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,270
I won't let you escape!

281
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,230
Gum-Gum...

282
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,100
Sickle-Sickle...

283
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,770
Pistol!!

284
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,400
Whirlwind!!

285
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,580
I won't let you escape.

286
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,970
We're gonna run into a rock!

287
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,680
Luffy!

288
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,370
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

289
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,250
What is this?!

290
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,850
That's how I do it.

291
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,280
Dumbass!!

292
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,850
That was close...

293
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,570
Yoo-hoo!

294
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,880
Yoo-hoo!

295
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,770
Yoo-hoo!

296
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,490
Nami said to come to the
edge of that cape, right?

297
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah.

298
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,370
Darn. We couldn't get rid of them.

299
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,110
Yeah.

300
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,170
Well, after all, we have
no choice but to make a raid...

301
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,160
Yikes!!

302
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,350
Go! Go!

303
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,420
Go!

304
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,660
Yoo-hoo!!

305
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,830
What a crazy plan that was!

306
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,370
Well, it worked out!

307
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,860
Exactly.

308
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,020
Go after them! Go after that ship!

309
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,360
We can't move because
the sail is in our way!

310
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,890
What?!

311
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,690
I think this will do.

312
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,370
That was fun.

313
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,030
That was fun!

314
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,090
Apis! Are you okay?

315
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,340
Yep!

316
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,270
Luffy, we can leave any time now.

317
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,520
Okay!

318
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,770
Set sail... for Lost Island!!

319
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,050
But which way?

320
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,850
Hmmm, that way? Or, maybe this way?

321
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,370
Huh? Huh? Huh?

322
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,410
Are we gonna be okay
when you're so unreliable?

323
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,950
Well, we'll just have to go.

324
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,340
It's not on the sea chart, either, so...

325
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,130
You're lovely, Nami-san,
even when you're decisive.

326
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
You know...

327
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,300
Our destination is Lost Island!!

328
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

329
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

330
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

331
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

332
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

333
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,490
Why is it so hot?

334
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

335
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

336
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

337
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

338
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

339
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,980
Which direction is Lost Island?

340
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,380
Who knows. Grandpa Ryu is sleeping, so...

341
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,200
Ahh. You're so irresponsible...

342
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,980
I don't see it on the sea chart.

343
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,240
Ahhh! A ship has appeared
right in front of us!!

344
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,320
That's the Going Merry!!

345
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,120
Hey, could this place be...

346
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,500
Is this the legendary island?

347
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,710
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,510
"A Solitary Island in the Distant Sea!
The Legendary Lost Island"

349
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
