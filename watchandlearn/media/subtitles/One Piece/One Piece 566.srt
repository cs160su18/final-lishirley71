00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,360
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,860
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,870
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,730
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,790
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,640
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,780
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,430
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

81
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,210
What's wrong?

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,090
L-Look at that!

83
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,510
I can't believe it!

84
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,840
There is air!

85
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:48,680
"Coming to an End! The Final
Decisive Battle against Hordy!"

86
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,160
That toughness should put
his worth over 100 million.

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,790
This wound...

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,290
Luffy-sama...

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,460
I won't let you interfere
with my plan, Straw Hat!

90
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,730
You can't lay a finger on the ship!

91
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,900
The Fish-Man Island is
doomed to fall like this!

92
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,280
Second Gear!

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,900
Gum-Gum...

94
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,870
...Jet Pistol!

95
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,350
You're too slow, Straw Hat!

96
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Luffy-sama...

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,770
Luffy-sama!

98
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
Gum-Gum...

99
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,580
...Jet Bazooka!

100
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,500
Armament Hardening!

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,130
Gum-Gum...

102
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,230
...Red Hawk!

103
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,980
These fangs aren't fake!

104
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,500
I know you're in pain, Straw Hat!

105
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:40,020
Damn! He's pretty tough! Red Hawk
worked much better a while ago.

106
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,320
This is the power I was granted by heaven,

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,740
to destroy you evil lowly creatures - humans!

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,490
I bet you thought you could gain the
upper hand fighting where you can breathe

109
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,120
but it's no use.

110
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,290
Nobody can best this righteous power!

111
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,050
And nobody can stop me from getting revenge!

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,380
Hordy.

113
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,990
I'm sure that he is now beyond
his physical capacity.

114
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,640
But he became a real
monster due to his grudge

115
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,860
toward humans and the Energy Steroid.

116
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,900
Straw Hat.

117
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,490
Luffy-san is losing.

118
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,450
Hordy Jones... Is he invulnerable?

119
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,910
I repeat.

120
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,080
The giant ship - Noah is still
falling toward the Fish-Man Island

121
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,510
and on the deck of the Noah, Luffy-san
is engaging in battle with Hordy!

122
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,340
--The Noah is gonna crush us!
--Can't we do anything?!

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,010
Straw Hat!

124
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,310
Did you hear that? Our captain is doing fine.

125
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,740
Our cause was right after all.
We were chosen by heaven!

126
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,740
It's a one-in-a-million chance for
your captain to win the fight!

127
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,240
No.

128
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,630
Like I said, I believe in him.

129
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,190
Our captain will never lose!

130
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,630
Joke around while you can!

131
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,850
Chopper, what do you mean you're okay?

132
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,810
Now, I can fight like this for
3 minutes with the Rumble Ball.

133
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm not the same person that I used to be.

134
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,200
I won't cause you guys trouble anymore.

135
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,230
I can't believe it!

136
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,620
We can really depend on you
if you can control that power!

137
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:10,590
Y-Your compliment doesn't make
me happy at all, you bastard!

138
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,670
That's creepy!

139
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,550
You pissed me off-dosun!

140
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,500
No matter how big you get, I'll blow
you away to the end of the sea-gogan!

141
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm not gonna be blown away to anywhere.

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,520
Now, bring it on!

143
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,570
Chopper!

144
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,850
You fool!

145
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,860
Talking to a friend while fighting?
You don't know your place!

146
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,330
You're just a burden to the Straw Hats!

147
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,550
I'm gonna take care of you already!

148
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,930
I told you I finished setting it up.

149
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,590
Now, bring it on! I'll put
on an awesome magic show!

150
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,450
Much! How funny! Did you say you're
gonna end this with one shot?!

151
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,430
Maybe the Squid Spear didn't work on you

152
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,940
but I have another one that
will cut through anything-ch!

153
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,380
Emit light! Light Bright Spear!

154
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,280
I will beat you with one shot instead-ch!

155
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,620
I'm gonna cut a hole through your cockpit-ch!

156
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,580
That looks kind of cool but...

157
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,460
...it's not gonna work! You're
less than an ordinary squid...

158
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,760
...before my ultimate weapon!

159
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,720
I can't fight with my bare
hands. What should I do?

160
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,020
I won't cut a man without the
fighting spirit! Go away, Froggy!

161
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,060
Frog?

162
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,650
I don't know what he is talking about.

163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,570
He doesn't know that my
deadly poison will kill him!

164
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,350
Finish this up? That's my line.

165
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,140
Don't think that I inflated myself just
because I got taken in by you fools!

166
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,670
I'm gonna roll around and squash
your friends in the plaza!

167
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,390
Are you listening?!

168
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,250
Sorry, I was thinking about something else.

169
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,570
Thinking about something else?!

170
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,870
Yeah, I was thinking how should I
cook an unnecessarily big blowfish.

171
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,330
What?! Do it if you can!

172
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,430
Blowfish!

173
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,080
All right...

174
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,280
Luffy-sama! You are bleeding!

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,580
Can't you see it? There
is nothing you can do!

176
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,770
You will never beat me!

177
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,800
Weren't you listening to what I said?

178
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,890
I will save the Fish-Man
Island and Shirahoshi...

179
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,430
Luffy-sama...

180
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,850
...and keep my promise to a friend.

181
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,560
Straw Hat...

182
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,190
I'll protect...

183
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,820
...everything!

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,390
Seems like you humans have
to die in order to realize...

185
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,520
...how arrogant you are
even though you're so weak!

186
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,580
Then I'm gonna make you realize!

187
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,990
I have no time! Let's wrap this up already!

188
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,740
Beat me if you can!

189
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,250
--Yowahoshi, stay away!
--Y-Yes!

190
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,010
Fish-Man Jiu-Jitsu - Water Heart!

191
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,550
Shark Pack!

192
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,520
You can't get away!

193
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,990
Go to hell!

194
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,960
Luffy-sama...

195
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,670
Straw Hat!

196
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,490
Luffy-sama!

197
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,120
Third Gear!

198
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,380
Armament Hardening!

199
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,720
Drop dead already!

200
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,010
Gum-Gum...

201
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,140
...Elephant Gun!

202
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,310
It's no use!

203
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,160
You puny humans could never stop me...

204
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,330
...from taking revenge!

205
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,120
I will stop the Noah!

206
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,360
Keep falling, Noah!

207
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:38,180
Kill all the pride-less Fish-Men!

208
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,470
Gum-Gum...

209
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,640
...Elephant Gatling!

210
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,290
This is my space, skeleton man.

211
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,900
If you enter this circle, I'm gonna
break your bones into pieces!

212
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,740
What are you gonna do now?!

213
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,250
Okay, I'm sorry but...

214
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,840
...I got into the circle and cut you already.

215
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,840
It's going to be cold. Take care of yourself.

216
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,930
When did you get in?!

217
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,640
Song of Scratches, Blizzard Slice!

218
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,610
Let me read a haiku.

219
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,110
The blood-freezing wind from
the far land of the dead...

220
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,070
...Please, blow up some skirts!

221
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,990
Drop dead!

222
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,590
What is it?!

223
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,960
Green Star - Humandrake!

224
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:23,140
This plant has human-shaped roots
which attack things flying over,

225
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,010
totally entwining them!

226
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,810
What is it this time?!

227
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,070
Green Star - Trampolia! It'll blow
away all approaching enemies!

228
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,240
And now you're up high in the air
- there's nothing you can do!

229
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,780
Special Attack - Green Star!

230
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,190
A monster from aboveground?!
I'll bite it off!

231
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,750
You better not.

232
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,790
The bulb on its nose

233
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,260
will release a powerful shockwave
3 meters in diameter.

234
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,430
Impact Wolf!

235
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,060
Dosun! Dogan! Bogan!

236
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:20,030
Now, get blown away to the end
of the world-gadon-megagon!

237
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,700
Papara-Hammer!

238
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,910
Cloven Rose, Palm!

239
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,000
Pi... pikon.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,370
Squid! Squid! Squid!

241
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,740
Chew on this - the spear that will cut
through even an undersea mountain!

242
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,060
Franky...

243
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,640
Squid! Squid! Squid!

244
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,640
...Radical Beam!

245
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,190
Dried squid!

246
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,400
What?!

247
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,570
L-Laser beam?!

248
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,900
Cool!!

249
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,170
Fish-Man Karate technique!

250
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,970
Vagabond Drill!

251
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,350
What?!

252
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,690
Water blasted through his body!

253
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,020
The air will leak...

254
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,450
How do you like it up here, Balloon Blowfish!

255
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,050
That human is flying!

256
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,180
You scared the guts out of me!

257
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,370
Remember, over the past 2 years...

258
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,130
Sanji-kun!

259
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,670
Why did I have to go through such hell?!

260
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,010
He's on fire!

261
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,050
I want to burn those memories!

262
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,780
Hell Memories!

263
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,940
Scared the guts out of you?
You saved me the trouble then.

264
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,190
Because when I cook blowfish,

265
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,860
I have to remove the toxic parts carefully.

266
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,860
Take these swords coated with my venom!

267
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,620
Cut it out, Froggy.

268
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,350
I'm not a frog!

269
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,930
I'm the best octopus eight-sword
style swordsman...

270
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,600
...on the Fish-Man Island! My
name is Hyouzou! Don't forget it!

271
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,750
Purgatory...

272
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,450
...Onigiri!

273
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm so sorry.

274
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,760
I thought that you were a frog.
A big frog in a small pond.

275
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,490
He...

276
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,360
He did it!

277
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,910
This time for sure!

278
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,990
He beat Hordy!

279
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,760
The Noah falls toward Fish-Man Island,
as if inheriting Hordy's grudge.

280
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,930
Just when the insurmountably huge mass...

281
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,800
...causes everyone to lose hope,

282
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,340
Luffy alone...

283
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,180
...pushes his life to the limit
and stands against the Noah!

284
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,700
On the next episode of One Piece!

285
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,820
"Stop, Noah! Desperate Elephant Gatling!"

286
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,090
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
