2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,750
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,700
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,790
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,410
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,760
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,450
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,450
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,260
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,070
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,880
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,380
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,010
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,260
"Hawk-Eye Mihawk! The Great
Swordsman Zoro Falls on the Sea"

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,570
--Ugh...
--What'd you just say?!

26
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,340
Nami ran off with the Going Merry?!

27
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,890
What do you mean by that?!

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,680
It happened just a moment ago!

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,310
What's the matter, Big Sis Nami?

30
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,850
Huh?

31
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,050
You were looking at wanted posters.

32
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,070
Oh... Nothing...

33
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,240
You're impressive as usual.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,320
So you've set your eyes
on a big bounty pirate.

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,340
But Arlong is the one pirate
that you shouldn't go after.

36
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,330
I hear he's super terrifyingly strong...

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,530
He kept himself quiet
and out of sight for a while.

38
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,420
But he started going
wild again recently.

39
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,420
Well, it's hard to give up on that
20-million berry bounty, though...

40
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,630
This guy's so strong that
there's a shred of possibility

41
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,430
that even we may be killed by a hair...

42
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,760
Huh?

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,220
Big Sis Nami?

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,060
Uhm, I'm sorry, but could you
turn around? I want to change...

45
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,860
What?! W-Well...

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,030
Change? Here? Now?!

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,240
May I?

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,570
Please go ahead!

49
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,530
True to her looks, she's so bold!

50
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,460
It wouldn't hurt if we take
a quick peek, would it?

51
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,250
Oh, yeah...

52
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,430
Wh-What're you doing?!

53
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,030
What am I doing? Of course, business!

54
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm a thief that only targets
pirates. I'll take this ship.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,110
I never said that I became a member.
I just joined forces with them. That's all.

56
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,880
I only spent a short time with Luffy
and the others, but I had lots of fun.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,300
--Tell them...
--What?!

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,220
...that if we're linked
by fate, we'll meet again.

59
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,430
Big Sis Nami!

60
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,140
H-Hey! We'll be in trouble!

61
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,720
We were more or less
asked to watch the ship!

62
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,490
So that's how she took the ship...

63
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,200
We're sorry!

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,500
Dammit! She's making
this crisis worse for us!

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,790
Kaya gave that ship to us!

66
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,710
Wait! I can still see it!
It's the Going Merry!

67
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,780
Where's your ship?

68
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,220
We still have it here...

69
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,430
Zoro! Usopp! Leave right away!
Take that ship and follow Nami!

70
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,200
Forget about it.
Just give that ship to her.

71
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,850
No need of going after that woman.

72
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,860
I won't accept anyone
but her as our navigator!

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,370
All right, all right...
What a high-maintenance captain...

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,360
Hey Usopp, let's go!

75
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,930
Uh? Okay...

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,090
--Big Bro Zoro, the ship is ready!
--Big Bro Zoro, the ship is ready!

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,950
Luffy, what about you?

78
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,090
I can't go since I haven't settled
anything at this restaurant.

79
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,890
Be careful.
The situation here isn't normal.

80
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,850
Yeah, I know.

81
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,770
Wh-What? What the hell just happened?

82
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,810
The ship's been split into two!

83
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,890
Look at that!

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,610
It's him!

85
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,990
Don Krieg! It's him!

86
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,350
It's the man who destroyed our fleet!

87
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Th... That man!

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,180
So that man is...

89
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,470
That son of a bitch!

90
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,260
He followed us here... to kill us!!

91
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,440
We're done for!

92
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Zoro?

93
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,060
Who's that?

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,240
The man I've been looking for.

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,660
Hawk-Eye Mihawk!

96
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,780
Hawk-Eye Mihawk...

97
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,130
The world's strongest man...

98
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,680
That's the man who sank Krieg's
50 ships on his own in the Grand Line?

99
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,470
Then, the one who destroyed
Krieg's ship just now is also...

100
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,380
But he looks just like
an ordinary human.

101
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,240
It doesn't look like he
has any special weapons.

102
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,190
His weapon is on his back...

103
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,150
That... can't be!

104
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,960
Did he really slice up that large
sailing ship using that sword?

105
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,690
He's the master swordsman Hawk-Eye...

106
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,450
...the man who stands above all
other swordsmen in the world...

107
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,110
I never thought I'd be
able to see him this soon...

108
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,170
It's finally... time to fulfill my promise...

109
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840
Y-You son of a bitch...

110
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,390
What grudge do you
have to come after us?!

111
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,060
Just killing time.

112
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,990
Wha?! Don't mock us!

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,820
Wh-What?!

114
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,050
I'm sure I aimed straight for him!

115
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,330
He averted them.

116
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,170
He gently changed
the course of the bullets

117
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,330
using the point of his sword.

118
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,170
That can't be true...

119
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,090
Hey! Who are you?!

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,880
Three swords... Could it be...

121
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,840
I've never seen a sword
moved so gently...

122
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,390
There is no strength in
swordplay based only on force.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Did you use that sword to
slice up this ship as well?

124
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,350
That's right.

125
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,560
I see... You're the strongest...

126
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,480
I came out to sea to meet you.

127
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,410
What's your goal?

128
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,820
To become the strongest!

129
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,450
Hmph... How foolish...

130
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,880
You've got spare time,
right? Let's fight!

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,420
Th-This guy is Zoro! Roronoa Zoro
of the Three Swords Style!

132
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,130
What?!

133
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,760
Oh, a pirate hunter, huh?

134
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,140
He is?!

135
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,580
Hey, this isn't good, Luffy!

136
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,050
The Going Merry will
be out of sight soon!

137
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,400
Hey, Luffy!

138
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,570
Fight? Hmph! How pitiful, weak one...

139
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,960
If you are a competent
enough swordsman,

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,800
you should be able to see
the disparity in our abilities

141
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,910
even before we cross swords.

142
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,000
Is it your courage or ignorance that
causes you to turn your sword on me?

143
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,000
It's my ambition!

144
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,840
And it's also because of a
promise I made to a dear friend!

145
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,560
Hawk-Eye Mihawk,
the world's strongest swordsman,

146
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,620
and the pirate hunter Zoro...

147
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,190
What kind of fight will it be?

148
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,860
There can't possibly be anyone
who can defeat Big Bro!

149
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,360
Big Bro is the strongest already!

150
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,470
Hey, what's the meaning of that?

151
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,450
I'm no beast that goes all
out when hunting a rabbit.

152
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,730
Even if you're a swordsman who's
earned a bit of a name for himself,

153
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,420
this sea, the East Blue, is the
weakest among the four seas.

154
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,720
Unfortunately, I don't carry any
smaller sharp instrument than this one.

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,300
That's enough making fun of me!

156
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,600
Better not regret it when I kill you!

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,930
Frog in the well...
Know how big the world is.

158
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,910
Oni... Giri!

159
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,150
Wh-What?!

160
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,410
Zoro?!

161
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,070
Wha... Big Bro's Oni Giri was stopped!

162
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,370
Even a big technique that never
fails to blow any enemy away was...

163
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,050
What's going on?!

164
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,660
I... I can't move them! What did he do?!

165
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,040
No one has ever seen
through this technique,

166
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,840
and he stopped it using a toy like that?!

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,800
This... can't be happening!

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,270
Our abilities are this far apart?!

169
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,430
That can't be right!
There's no way that it's this far...

170
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,520
The world's strongest can't be this far!

171
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,490
This can't be happening,
right, Big Bro?! Get serious!

172
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,150
Big Bro!

173
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,410
We can't be this far apart!

174
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,110
What ferocity your swordplay has...

175
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,510
He's taking Zoro's Three Swords Style
attacks with such a small knife...

176
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,520
He's a monster even beyond
the monstrous Zoro!

177
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,470
I didn't pursue
swordsmanship all this time

178
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,720
to be dealt with by a toy like this!

179
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,640
Zoro...

180
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,420
You're lucky, Zoro. You're a boy.

181
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,110
I want to be the world's
greatest swordsman, too!

182
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,070
If only... If only I had been born a man!

183
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't be whining like
that after you beat me!

184
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,380
That's not fair! You're my goal!

185
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,290
Zoro...

186
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,390
Promise me!

187
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,750
Someday, one of us will be
the world's greatest swordsman!

188
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,220
Promise me!

189
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,470
It's a promise!

190
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,660
To become the world's strongest!

191
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,640
I... I'm going to get
stronger for her, too!

192
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,680
I'll be the world's greatest swordsman
so that my name will reach heaven!

193
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,410
I promised her... I...

194
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,640
Only to defeat this man...

195
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,280
What do you bear on your shoulders?

196
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,120
What do you desire once you've
obtained power, weak one?

197
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,550
You called Big Bro a
weak one? You cross bastard!

198
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,980
I'll teach you a lesson! He is...

199
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,790
Stop it! Yosaku! Johnny!
Don't intervene!

200
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,970
Be patient!

201
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,050
Luffy...

202
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,010
I can't lose...

203
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,770
Tiger...

204
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,450
That sounds great!
The world's greatest swordsman?

205
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,990
The King of the Pirates would need
no less than that on his crew!

206
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,950
...Trap!

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,080
Are you just going to
let me pierce your heart?

208
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,790
Why aren't you withdrawing?

209
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,230
I don't know...

210
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,340
I don't know why, but...

211
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,130
...if I withdrew even a step,

212
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,240
I feel like those various
important things such as pledges

213
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,430
and promises in the
past will be shattered,

214
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,990
and I won't be able to come
back to where I am now...

215
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,290
Yes, that's what defeat is about.

216
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,760
Then, all the more reason
I can't withdraw...

217
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,050
Even if you'll die?

218
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,080
I'd rather die.

219
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,720
What a strong heart!
So he chooses death over defeat!

220
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,940
Kid! State your name.

221
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,360
Roronoa Zoro.

222
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,830
I'll remember it.

223
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,360
I haven't seen anyone like you
in a while, strong one. Thus...

224
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,230
...as a swordsman's courtesy,

225
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,750
I'll sink you using the world's
strongest black sword.

226
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,570
I appreciate it.

227
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,190
H-He took it out!

228
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,240
That's the sword that sliced up the ship!

229
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,970
So this'll be the last hit...

230
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,290
Will it be the world's strongest?

231
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,300
Or death?

232
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,230
Big Bro! That's enough! Please stop!

233
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,100
Three Swords Style Secret Technique!

234
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,730
Fall!

235
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,840
Three Thousand Worlds!

236
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,890
I lost...

237
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,300
I never imagined I'd ever lose...

238
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,090
So this is the power
of the world's strongest...

239
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,090
What are you...

240
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,930
Scars on the back are
a swordsman's shame...

241
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,350
Admirable!

242
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,160
Zoro!!

243
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,940
Don't live so hastily, young man.

244
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,610
Zoro!!

245
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,070
--Big Bro!!
--Big Bro!!

246
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,540
Why?

247
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,130
When I decided to become
the strongest swordsman,

248
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,650
I decided to devote my life to it.

249
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,970
He's crazy! His opponent
is the real world's strongest!

250
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,650
How it'd turn out was clear. He should
give up his ambition rather than die!

251
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,980
It should be easy...
to give up your ambition, right?!

252
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,900
So this is the power of the Grand Line...
the power of the world!

253
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,200
To think the pirate hunter Zoro
is as helpless as a new-born baby!

254
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,960
Damn you, damn you... Damn you!!

255
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,490
--Big Bro!!
--Big Bro!!

256
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,630
Wh-What's that?

257
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,710
So that brat... has the
power of a devil fruit!

258
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,940
You bastard...

259
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,010
Are you that young
swordsman's comrade?

260
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,810
You also impressed me for
watching it to the very end!

261
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,940
Don't worry. I didn't kill that man.

262
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,690
What?

263
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,440
Big Bro! Big Bro! Say something!

264
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,360
Zoro?!

265
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Zoro!!

266
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
Now, hurry up and get
him up on the ship!

267
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,870
This is medicine! Throw it over him!

268
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,830
It's still too early for you to die.
My name is Dracule Mihawk!

269
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,520
Learn about yourself!
Learn about the world!

270
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,800
And become strong!

271
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,240
No matter how many years it takes,

272
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,760
I will hold this seat of
the strongest and wait for you.

273
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,490
Surpass this sword!

274
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,930
Try to surpass me! Roronoa Zoro!

275
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,220
Big Bro! Big Bro, say something!

276
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,610
To think that he got Hawk-Eye
Mihawk to say this much...

277
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,400
Kid, what is your goal?

278
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,990
King of the Pirates!

279
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,740
It'll be even harder than surpassing me!

280
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,430
How would I know when
I haven't done it yet?!

281
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,720
He's alive!

282
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,140
He's just unconscious.

283
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,130
--Big Bro!
--Big Bro! Say something!

284
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,880
Zoro?

285
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,770
Big Bro!

286
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,840
L... Luffy...

287
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,830
Can you hear me?

288
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,810
Yeah!

289
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,460
Did I worry you?

290
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:03,240
You need no less than the world's
greatest swordsman, right?

291
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,360
Big Bro! Please don't talk any more!

292
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,200
Big Bro!

293
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,990
I... I will not be defeated ever again!

294
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,380
Until the day I defeat him
and become a master swordsman...

295
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,300
I'll never... be defeated!
Got any problems with that...

296
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,970
...King of the Pirates?!

297
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,520
Nope!

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,980
You're a good team.
I want to see you guys again.

299
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,970
Hey, Hawk-Eye!

300
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,000
Didn't you come to take my life...

301
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,460
...the life of the East
Blue's ruler, Don Krieg?

302
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,050
I was going to, but I had enough fun.

303
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,870
So I'm going home to get some rest.

304
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,210
You may have had enough,
but I'm tired of getting beaten.

305
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,750
D-Don?

306
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,220
Why are you trying to keep him here?

307
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,470
Die before you leave!!

308
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,430
As I expected...
he never learns a lesson...

309
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,070
Damn! He escaped...

310
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,210
Usopp!

311
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,660
Luffy!

312
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,370
Go! I'll leave Nami to you!

313
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,970
Got it! Zoro and I will
bring Nami back for sure!

314
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,340
Make sure you get that cook to join us!

315
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,430
When all five of us
are reunited, let's go to...

316
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,890
...the Grand Line!

317
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,140
Yeah! Let's do that!

318
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,400
Guys! We ran into some interference,
but the real fight starts now!

319
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,180
We'll take that ship!

320
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,110
Yeah!!

321
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,500
Pops, can I stop doing
chores if I drive them away?

322
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,980
Suit yourself.

323
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,250
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

324
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,970
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

325
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else could
beat me to it

326
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:52,490
If the world is going to change

327
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:06,630
before I can even attain my dream

328
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,680
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

329
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,020
so that my memories won't fade

330
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,440
Krieg and his pirates are coming!

331
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,820
Honestly, what an
ungrateful bunch they are,

332
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,280
when they were given food!

333
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,400
Come to think of it,

334
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,030
there's another ungrateful one
who took treasure and ran off...

335
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,750
You shouldn't worry
about it! Get some rest!

336
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,990
Hey, a weird guy came out...

337
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,880
He's fully armed with shields!
Ow, ow, ow! Fire! Fire!

338
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

339
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,790
"The Deadly Foot Technique Bursts Forth!
Sanji vs. the Invincible Pearl"

340
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,980
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
