Wake up! Wake up! Wake

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210
Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,540
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,550
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,060
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,190
They freed the toys who had
been forced to labor as slaves

77
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,270
but Doflamingo trapped everybody
in the country in the Birdcage

78
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,230
and put prices on the heads
of Luffy and 11 others.

79
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,260
You have no time to wonder what to do.

80
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,850
People are falling and
towns are burning moment by moment.

81
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,990
Either you kill me...

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,490
...or kill the 12 criminals.

83
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,080
Now the game is on!

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,450
Our plan was to destroy the SMILE factory

85
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,100
and provoke a conflict between
Doflamingo and Kaido.

86
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,050
But if we kill Doflamingo now,

87
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,550
Kaido will direct all his anger over losing SMILEs,

88
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,110
...at us!

89
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,240
Then we'll have to fight face-to-face
with the angry Emperor!

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,020
That's not an issue now.

91
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,890
Take a good look at this country!
If I stop now, what's gonna happen to it?!

92
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,410
Issho-san, don't we need
to capture Doflamingo?

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,550
Restrain as many out-of-control people
as possible

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,640
and focus on Straw Hat and
Law's pirate alliance!

95
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,390
What?!

96
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,670
Send that message to all units!

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,510
Stop it.

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,370
He who shoots oft at last
shall not hit the mark.

99
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,710
The Navy admiral!

100
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,980
The gambling old man!

101
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,010
"With a Rumbling of the Ground!
The God of Destruction - Giant Pica Descends!"

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm gonna go kick Doflamingo's ass!
Get out of my way!

103
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,960
You are quite brash. But...

104
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,960
...I'm not going to step aside.

105
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,210
You wanna fight?

106
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,760
What an unpleasant chore this is.

107
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,050
THE ROYAL PALACE

108
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,610
Doflamingo-sama!

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,700
Straw Hat Luffy and the
others are clashing with

110
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,860
Fujitora and Navy soldiers at this very moment!

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,210
Is that so? Let them fight.

112
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,870
The Navy and the pirates,

113
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,730
if you allow me to create havoc...

114
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,850
--The voice!
--His voice is...

115
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,720
I can take care all of them by myself!

116
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,710
PICA - A TOP EXECUTIVE
OF THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

117
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,890
His voice is so high!

118
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,380
How could a giant man like that
have such voice!

119
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,630
Oh no... I still can't get used to it

120
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,970
even though I've heard it so many times!

121
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,870
But if I burst out laughing, he'll kill me!

122
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,470
We're in no hurry.

123
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,610
You see, this game is like an
election to select the king.

124
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,230
I asked the nation of Dressrosa.

125
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,620
Who is more fit to be their king?
Is it the Riku Family or the Don Quixote Family?

126
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,760
People choose their king.
It's their legitimate right.

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,730
It's bothersome!

128
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,660
You idiot!
Do you want him to kill you?!

129
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,520
We should just get rid of all the pests!

130
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,670
Hold it! You have to hold it!

131
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,760
All we have to do is
repel the ones who are coming

132
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,000
and sit back and watch the
others kill each other.

133
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,010
Doffy! I...

134
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,120
Whoa! I-I'm sorry, Pica-sama!

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,950
Please forgive him!

136
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,370
He's new and he was sort
of taken by surprise...

137
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,930
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

138
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,660
I'm gonna bury you alive!
You'll be stuck in stones...

139
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,630
Wait, Pica-sama!

140
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,970
Armsmorphosis!

141
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,440
Gatling Girl!

142
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,580
If you handle it,
you'll destroy his body completely!

143
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,490
Then his family can't bury him.

144
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,030
Thank you, Baby 5!

145
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,550
You.

146
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,720
Y-Y-Yes, sir!

147
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,670
Do you have a family?

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,820
What? Yes, I do.

149
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,950
How about you?

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,650
Oh, yes, me too.

151
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,300
I lost my mother when I was eight
and killed my father when I was ten.

152
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,170
The members who are ranked

153
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,040
as executives and above are
my family who I've been

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,860
through thick and thin with.

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,030
They are all I've got!

156
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,250
I won't forgive anyone who laughs at my family!

157
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,380
Got it?

158
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,340
Y-Yes, sir!

159
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,920
The Five-star - Usopp is in the Colosseum!

160
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,870
That way! Go after him!

161
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,780
Kill him!

162
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,840
Leave me alone!

163
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,230
Usoland is a man of 500 million!
Everybody wants him!

164
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,250
That's our legendary hero!

165
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,680
It's not something to be proud of!

166
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,710
But I have to accept it.

167
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,300
Nobody can help chasing after a star...

168
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,390
like me.

169
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,990
So cool!

170
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,840
A round of applause!

171
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,260
--You guys...
--Stop fooling around and hurry up!

172
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,730
Robin-san, how can we get
to the King's Plateau?!

173
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,950
Because of the geographical
shift, the outer wall of

174
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,040
the Colosseum is connected to the plateau!

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,070
If we climb from there,
we can meet up with the others!

176
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,190
Found them!

177
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,160
They're increasing in number!

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,790
That's good!

179
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm gonna take care of them all at once!

180
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,450
--Hack-san?!
--Leave them up to me!

181
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,160
Get out of our way!

182
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,530
You money-blinded idiots!

183
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,130
I can't believe you people
knuckle under to Doflamingo!

184
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,030
Four Thousand Brick Fist!

185
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,340
There they are!

186
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
--Rebecca, you go ahead!
--Robin-san!

187
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,710
They are ours!

188
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,220
Bartolomeo!

189
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,710
I'm thrilled to hear
Robin-senpai call my name!

190
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,520
I-I'm gonna hold the enemies back here

191
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,970
so please go ahead with Sniper King-senpai!

192
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,180
Thank you!

193
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,970
Robin-senpai thanked me!

194
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm all fired up now!
I'm not gonna let anyone go after them!

195
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,480
Don't stand in my way!

196
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,960
You used the strange technique again!

197
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,590
Oh no... We have no role to play here.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
Let's go back to
the Young Master-sama for now-in!

199
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,140
All right.
Oh? Where did Señor go?

200
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,120
You know how he is-in.

201
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,710
He must be looking for that pervert

202
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,440
to have some kind of a hard-boiled face-off-in!

203
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,110
A hard-boiled face-off?

204
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,770
Wait for me, Little People!

205
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,610
I'm gonna super destroy the SMILE factory

206
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,320
and save you all!

207
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,520
Now we're here but...

208
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
How do we climb up there?

209
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,300
Count on me.

210
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,460
Cien Fleurs!

211
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,270
Spider Net!

212
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,420
Awesome!

213
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,240
A round of applause!

214
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,580
Y-You guys did it again...

215
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,190
--Leo, you guys go first!
--Okay!

216
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,170
Bartolomeo-san! Hack-san!

217
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,260
We can climb up from here!

218
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,970
Let's go.

219
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,170
If I climb up there,

220
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,510
I can see Luffy-senpai and
Zoro-senpai, can't I?!

221
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm so excited!

222
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,120
The key to Law's handcuffs
should be somewhere...

223
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,390
There it is!

224
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,620
Father-sama, Rebecca and
the others are down there!

225
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,500
What?!

226
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,940
There is the criminal!

227
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,280
Catch her!

228
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,180
Stop it!

229
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,020
You're...!

230
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,680
Tank!

231
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,480
Rebecca-sama!

232
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,330
I, Tank, will guard you with my life!

233
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,670
Oh! That's Captain Tank!

234
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,570
King Riku-sama!

235
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,010
I'm glad that he's okay!

236
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,910
Grandfather-sama!

237
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,180
Rebecca!

238
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,590
Wait for me, everybody!

239
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,260
I will take back the real Dressrosa!

240
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,460
A-Are you okay?

241
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,570
Thank you.

242
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,500
--Is this the junkyard?
--Yeah.

243
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,920
As its name suggests,
there's trash everywhere.

244
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,540
Hey, what's going on out there?!

245
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm not sure either.

246
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,200
Anyway, do you people know
a samurai warrior named Kanjuro?

247
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,530
Kanjuro?

248
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,780
What the...

249
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,550
What the hell!

250
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
What's going on?!

251
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,720
What are they up to this time?!

252
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,460
I-It's happening again!

253
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,000
What in the world is happening?!

254
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,070
Th-This is...

255
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,430
--Is that...
--Finally, he shows up!

256
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,120
When that guy emerges, it's all over!

257
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,100
No one can fight back anymore!

258
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,540
What the hell is that?!

259
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,850
A giant man?

260
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,800
He's gigantic!

261
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,090
That is...

262
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,260
Pica!

263
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,430
Pica-sama!

264
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,230
In...

265
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,510
Now, those of you who rebel
against our family...

266
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,150
What?

267
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,210
I'm gonna fight you!

268
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,080
His voice! It's so high!

269
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,340
But it totally doesn't fit!

270
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,710
What a funny voice!

271
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,820
Straw Hat!

272
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,160
P-P-P-Please stop!

273
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,700
Hey, hey, stop laughing, Straw Hat!

274
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,360
Pica-sama is sensitive about
his high-pitched voice!

275
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,300
If he runs wild with that massive body...

276
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,050
You idiot! You made Pica-sama mad!

277
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,770
How can you guys not laugh at it?

278
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,260
We can't!
Because we don't wanna die yet!

279
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,890
Run!

280
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,650
It's not just a punch!
It's like a part of the town falling onto us!

281
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,720
No! Pica is pissed!

282
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,120
Let's head for the Palace as we run-in!

283
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,430
It's so thrilling!

284
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,460
I feel something terrible is happening!

285
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,730
Issho-san, please run!
A giant stone man is...

286
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,340
Luffy! You have to stop messing
with your enemies...

287
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,840
I won't let you get away!

288
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,670
See! You can't help laughing either!

289
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,880
You guys...

290
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,280
It's coming!

291
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,130
Run! It's gonna crush you up!

292
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,760
I am running!

293
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,420
Luffy!

294
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,950
Luffy!!

295
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,840
The super-giant Pica smashes up
Luffy and the others!

296
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,970
Facing this worst-ever enemy,

297
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,110
the warriors who once
fought against each other

298
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,160
to the death in the Colosseum
come together and join Luffy,

299
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,660
and the group of unique
characters who are looking to

300
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,860
take down Doflamingo, start
making a significant advance!

301
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,530
"Gathering into a Powerful Front!
Luffy and a Group of Brutal Warriors!"

303
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
