00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,410
You're no match for our martial arts skills.

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,670
Now, hand it over already...

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,300
...or else it'll get dirty with your blood.

5
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,880
Dammit...

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,840
I thought... I could defeat you.

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,770
To tell you the truth...

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,270
...Iceberg-san told me to run right away.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,320
He told me to drop it quickly and run...

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,490
...since...

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,620
...it's a complete fake.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,450
What?

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,760
I got stuck! Dammit! I got stuck again!

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,760
--Why does this always happen?!
--Straw Hat...!

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,800
Tempest Kick.

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,390
His kicks cut the wall!

17
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,730
Wh-What the hell are these?

18
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,150
We've got an emergency situation.

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,200
We don't have time for you.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,450
--I can't move!
--Hey, restrain that guy, too.

21
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,460
Go home!

22
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,430
I've got nothing I could give you people!

23
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,340
If you don't, that puts us in quite a bind.

24
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,890
What should I tell you first...

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,650
...when you're about to die?

26
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,780
You disappointed me.

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,700
Lucci!

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,990
It's your own fault.

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,410
You should've given it to the
Government when they asked nicely.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,500
Kaku!

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,790
If possible, I wanted to make this town
part of my memory without hurting you.

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,260
Kalifa...

33
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,430
So you also inherited your
master's obstinacy, huh?

34
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,220
Blueno, from the bar...

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,930
You guys... work for... the Government?

36
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,060
That's right. Going undercover
was a pretty easy mission for us.

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,900
In any case, your prudence
leaves me at a loss for words.

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,240
Now, Iceberg-san...

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,950
Where're the blueprints of
the ancient weapon Pluton?

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,870
Please tell us, before many people get hurt.

41
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,110
It's all right! Now let's move forward

42
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,610
with the sun always in our hearts

43
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,950
As power passes through our clasped hands

44
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,620
let's grab hold of our wishes

45
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,590
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

46
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:09,970
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

47
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,900
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,990
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

49
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,410
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

50
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,330
but what you cherish most will be right there

51
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,420
And if you get into a jam

52
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,420
I'll always be there to protect you

53
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,550
It's all right! Now let's move forward

54
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,180
with the sun always in our hearts

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,140
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

56
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,430
and gaze at the light beyond

57
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,400
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,610
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

59
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,570
So let's grab hold of our wishes

60
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,370
under the same flag-- together, we're one

61
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,040
One Piece

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:28,010
"Secret Bond! Iceberg and Franky"

63
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,020
I'd better hurry up. The waves
and wind are getting rough.

64
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,660
What's he doing?!

65
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,750
G-Give it back to me!

66
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,130
We have to... have our ship repaired...

67
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,180
That money is crucial to us!

68
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,270
With that money...

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,360
...we can finally repair the Merry's scars!

70
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,570
I can't let you jerks have it!

71
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,870
Come to think of it, he said
that 200 million Berries

72
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,120
was going to be used for
the repair of their ship.

73
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,500
It appears that he doesn't know
Aqua Laguna is coming tonight.

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,460
Hmph! What a waste of effort.

75
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Okay! If I keep it airtight like this

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,350
and reinforce the ship with lumber,
it'll probably do fine.

77
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,470
That's not necessary.

78
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,230
Wh... Who's there?

79
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,810
"Who's there"?

80
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,280
Hey, hey... You've already
forgotten me... long-nosed lad?

81
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,450
Th-That voice... That guy's...

82
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,570
Wh-Wh-What'd you come
here for, you bastard?!

83
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,120
Now, now, don't lose your cool like that.

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,870
Fighting in a place like this
won't get us anywhere.

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This area will soon sink due to a storm surge.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,340
I guess we'll make this ship that you
love so much our hostage, too, huh?

87
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,670
Wh-What're you talking about?

88
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,930
Well... I have some business with Straw Hat...

89
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,050
...so I came here to kidnap you.

90
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,950
Don't worry. I used the back of my swords.

91
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,620
Why'd you have to knock
down all the shipwrights?!

92
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,290
Wow, Zoro is strong!

93
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,840
Oh, well... Let's go already!

94
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,250
Zoro! This way!

95
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,880
Yeah!

96
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,760
No, I said, this way!

97
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,630
How could you go in the wrong direction
when we're leading the way for you?!

98
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,260
A miracle?!

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,680
Oh, that way.

100
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,390
Nami! Zoro has disappeared!

101
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,020
This is a miracle!

102
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,520
He got lost again?!

103
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,280
See?! My head came out...
since it's made of rubber.

104
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,540
Okay, good job! Get every body
part out by doing what you just did!

105
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,290
Yep! No problem!

106
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,770
All right! I'm out... since I'm a rubber man!

107
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,360
Good job! Okay! Take off my cuffs!

108
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Okay!

109
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,290
Just wait and see... damn bull and skull...!

110
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,040
We were undercover for five years.

111
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,010
Please don't worry. We didn't
cut corners with our work.

112
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,680
I do understand how dispirited you are.

113
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,810
However, since we can't spend
any more time on this matter,

114
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,110
we're going to try our best to achieve our goal.

115
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,150
If you're thinking of putting up an
unwise resistance, I suggest you don't.

116
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,910
You know the name "Cipher Pol," don't you?

117
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,790
It's the Government's
supreme intelligence agency,

118
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,370
with eight bases around the world,
called CP1 through CP8 by people.

119
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,500
When the Government orders it, they dig
up any kind of information in any place.

120
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,090
I know about them...

121
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,970
...but only up to CP8.

122
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,130
Right...

123
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,720
However, we are CP9, the 9th Cipher Pol,
a supposedly non-existent unit.

124
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,690
Since we possess a certain privilege,
we can't reveal ourselves to the public.

125
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,440
Privilege?

126
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,110
That's right...

127
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,940
This is in the name of justice to the end,

128
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,030
but when there're citizens who are
uncooperative toward the Government...

129
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,450
...we have permission to kill them.

130
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,960
How selfish...! Justice cannot
be a reason for killing!

131
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,710
The World Government has
partially changed their thinking.

132
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,510
Rather than remaining in fear
of the weapon's restoration,

133
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,670
they decided to awaken it

134
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,550
to make it into a force of justice
that can end this Great Pirate Era.

135
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,100
However, you don't want to help them.

136
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,560
You're saying that you don't want to "save"
those people who keep being victimized

137
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,360
by pirates around the world.

138
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Nonsense... If the weapon is restored,
the world will only fight over its power.

139
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
The damage only keeps growing!

140
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,790
It seems that you don't trust
the Government, Iceberg-san.

141
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,750
I just know the nature of humans, that's all, lad.

142
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,850
Restrain yourself. Just how long are
you going to keep acting like my boss?

143
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,030
Kaku, check his pulse.

144
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,240
Pardon me.

145
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,250
Iceberg-san...

146
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,920
To tell you the truth, we came up
with a hypothesis a bit ago.

147
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,550
Please don't worry. It's not that
we're going to torture you now.

148
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,470
All you have to do is listen to our
hypothesis without saying a word.

149
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,270
I'm sure your blood will tell us the truth.

150
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,260
Be careful when you walk. Or you'll get hurt.

151
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,300
Get off of me!

152
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,480
Grandma, Grandma! Aren't we going back yet?

153
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,520
Well... we've got a nice wind blowing.
Why don't we take the long way?

154
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,940
It's just perfect for sobering up.

155
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,320
What? When you're still drinking right now?

156
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,040
Say, can you sober up
while you're still drinking?

157
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,170
Sure I can. I haven't been drinking
for several decades for nothing.

158
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,710
Er... Several decades?! That's weird!

159
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,970
That's weird!

160
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,260
That's weird! That's weird!

161
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,140
That's weird!

162
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,980
Ah... it hasn't been several decades.

163
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,230
It's been eight years...

164
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:16,000
Well then, I'll explain the thought
process leading to our hypothesis.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,790
First, we have doubts about your
action of passing off the fake to us.

166
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,260
You guessed that the culprits
who came after the blueprints

167
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,930
were from the Government, so you
indicated where the fake was.

168
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,850
However, if it happened to be
someone who had a grudge against you

169
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,020
and they just came to kill you,

170
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,150
the real blueprints would lose their owner
and they'd no longer be passed down.

171
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,700
You're not stupid enough not
to think about that possibility.

172
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,870
Even though you knew that,

173
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,160
you still didn't try to give the
real blueprints to anyone tonight.

174
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
That means you've already
entrusted them with someone.

175
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,050
At the very least,
you don't have them with you.

176
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,460
So we think.

177
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,890
It's no use. Don't act up.

178
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,680
This is still only a possibility.

179
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,560
Of course, no convincing proof
can be found anywhere.

180
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,850
The past five years of our
surveillance and investigation

181
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,020
found no proof in your actions, either.

182
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,400
In addition, the person who is
entrusted with the blueprints

183
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,660
has to have proper shipbuilding skills.

184
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,660
Well, let me continue with our hypothesis.

185
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,370
Now things are getting more interesting.

186
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,090
These are the fake blueprints
that you passed off on us earlier.

187
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,470
When I look at it carefully,
there're signatures by the architects.

188
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,640
"Tom," "Iceberg," and "Cutty Flam."

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,970
At the end, there's a
company name: "Tom's Workers."

190
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,020
You might've thought that you outwitted
your enemy by using these fakes.

191
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,480
But you never even dreamed that
your enemy was hiding this close.

192
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,230
That was your miscalculation.

193
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,280
To an overnight intruder
who came after the blueprints,

194
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,240
these would probably just be trash.

195
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,620
But to us, who lived in this
town for the past five years,

196
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,170
these architects' names are very interesting.

197
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Iceberg-san, you have a guest.

198
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,590
Tom's Workers, led by the
legendary shipwright Tom,

199
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,640
was a shipbuilding company
that was full of mysteries.

200
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,760
I think it used to be on this island,

201
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,890
but there's no list of workers
or company registration.

202
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:48,570
Just finding out the fact that you
were Tom's disciple was quite hard.

203
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,940
According to the report by the Government,

204
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,450
Tom had only two disciples.

205
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,990
And a Government official
verified that one of them died

206
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,580
in an accident that happened eight years ago.

207
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:07,460
Did you know... that Tom's
violent disciple Cutty Flam died?

208
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,090
However, I remember hearing
this name Cutty Flam before.

209
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,140
Iceberg-san, you have a guest. He said
you'd know who if I told you "Cutty Flam."

210
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:28,310
It was about four years ago, a little while
after we started going undercover here.

211
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,110
There was a man who came through the
Galley-La Company's gate to see you.

212
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,450
He used that name just once.

213
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,200
I remember it, too.

214
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,530
Me, too.

215
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,910
Shall I show him in?

216
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,580
No... turn him away.

217
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,220
In other words...

218
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,100
...Tom's other disciple Cutty Flam is still alive...

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,060
...and lives in this town...

220
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,440
...after changing his name to Franky!

221
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,990
What a roundabout way of meeting.

222
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,790
What're these?

223
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,750
Hey, they're the blueprints
for the ancient weapon.

224
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,750
Don't use the name Cutty Flam from now on.

225
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Huh?

226
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,260
It's only a matter of time before I get targeted.

227
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,090
Leave the island with them... Franky.

228
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Seems like there's no mistake about it.

229
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,640
I never thought that you and that
guy were connected like that.

230
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,190
It's true that no matter
how much we investigated,

231
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,030
we couldn't figure out his real identity.

232
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,110
But because he was a ship demolition worker

233
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,660
and because of his behavior,
we paid no attention to him.

234
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,450
I see... Involving a dead person
was indeed a perfect way to exploit

235
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,540
our blind spot, since our speculation
was generated only from the facts.

236
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,460
The Franky Family would come
to the shipyard to sell lumber.

237
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,460
So there were many chances
for you to make an arrangement

238
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,750
to give him the blueprints.

239
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,050
Now, come to think of it,

240
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,260
you could say that he was a
neighbor who kept a safe distance.

241
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,640
If you don't have the blueprints with you,

242
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,850
it makes sense that you held firm.

243
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,650
If it was your only fellow disciple
whom you entrusted them with,

244
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,400
it's also understandable that you didn't entrust
them with any of the foremen at Galley-La.

245
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,360
Now, our speculations
are connected as one line.

246
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,620
In addition...

247
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,120
...your pounding blood proved it to be true!

248
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,000
--Hurry!
--Hey!

249
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,210
Are you really sure this is the right way?

250
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't you say that!

251
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,050
They've been hurt quite badly.

252
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,180
Over there! That door is the one!
There's no mistake!

253
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,810
Many people are down over there, too!

254
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,520
Hm?

255
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,730
Now, you go ahead! Ahead of us!
Cut down the door and make a dash!

256
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,780
--Go ahead!
--What the hell?! Don't order me around!

257
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,780
Hey, Straw Hat!

258
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,620
You idiot! Wrong room! It's the next room!

259
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,330
Oh, the next room?

260
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,550
Well, it's not your fault.

261
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,670
So many things are happening tonight.

262
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,510
You're only human. It's just natural that
you couldn't hide your consternation.

263
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,060
I appreciate what you've done for us.

264
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,560
We're done with you.

265
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,890
Let's hurry and find Franky.

266
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,400
You bastards...!

267
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,400
Hm?

268
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,290
Where's Robin?!

269
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,160
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

270
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,710
How bothersome...!

271
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,340
Robin! I've finally found you!

272
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,640
Hey, Luffy! Where the hell have you been?!

273
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,310
Robin! I'm glad that I could see you again!

274
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,230
Hold on a sec... What's going on here?

275
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,660
Well, well, well...

276
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,500
Straw Hat...

277
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,580
Paulie...

278
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,800
Iceberg-san... What the hell...

279
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,090
...is going on?!

280
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

281
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

282
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

283
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

284
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

285
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

286
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

287
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

288
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

289
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

290
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

291
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

292
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

293
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

294
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

295
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

296
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

297
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,460
Hey, Robin! Why are you with jerks like them?!

298
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,260
That's right. They work for the
Government, right?! So why?!

299
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,430
Goodbye.

300
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,470
Wait! I won't accept it! We're not done talking!

301
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,810
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

302
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,400
"Come Back, Robin! Showdown with CP9!"

304
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
