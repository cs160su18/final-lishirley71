00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,970
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,780
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,200
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,380
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,410
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,220
As I promised, I'll kill you in
an instant. Die without pain.

35
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,020
Too bad. If you'd stayed connected with
that shepherd and had him protect you,

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,410
you would've been okay.

37
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,830
Now, this is it for you!

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,010
Don't kill him! Please! We don't need your key!

39
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,080
Now, die!

40
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,640
Usopp!

41
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,400
Who the hell are you?!

42
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,730
A hunter.

43
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,520
I-I'm sorry, Sanji-kun.

44
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,310
I...

45
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,320
After all... I...

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,860
You're still alive. That's all that matters.

47
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,660
Everyone has things that they
can do and things that they can't.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,030
Sanji...

49
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,930
Look outside, both of you.

50
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,120
No way...

51
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,940
The Gates of Justice are about to open.

52
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,610
Robin...!

53
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,050
Once those gates are opened
and Robin-chan goes through there,

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,830
the sea beyond hosts a nest of Sea Kings
and we have no means to cross it.

55
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,770
Past that, there's a large
prison and Navy Headquarters.

56
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,630
Soon Robin-chan will be taken
to a place beyond our reach.

57
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,050
Oh, no... Luffy didn't make it in time?

58
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,830
Teach her a lesson, Funkfreed!

59
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,850
Luffy is just ahead.

60
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,670
Don't hit her vital spots, got that?

61
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,440
Ivory...

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,870
...Dart!

63
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,810
I won't let you escape, you dumb woman!

64
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't underestimate me!

65
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,970
Now, let's go through the
doors to our dreams together.

66
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,930
Leave getting his key to me.

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,400
Are you changing fighters? That's fine by me.

68
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,360
I'll do what you can't do.

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,070
And you do what I can't do!

70
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,450
What?

71
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,660
Think carefully.

72
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Grasp the situation!

73
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,250
As long as we have you, we can
save Robin-chan for sure! Usopp!

74
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,590
I want to live!

75
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,530
Wh-What I can do...

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,960
"Fiery Kicks! Sanji's Full
Course of Foot Techniques"

77
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,080
As long as they have me... we can save Robin?

78
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,990
What's that? What does that mean?

79
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,960
Shave!

80
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,100
Go!

81
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,870
O-Okay! Usopp!

82
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,320
Ow, ow! My wounds hurt!

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,750
Bear it! It's better than
being killed here, right?!

84
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,720
Good point.

85
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,980
Iron Body Kenpo!

86
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,350
Wolf Repel!

87
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,050
Some hunter you are. You just talk big.

88
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,500
Oh, that's right. I get it!

89
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,640
What is it?

90
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,230
We can save her... As long as they
have me, we can save Robin! Dammit!

91
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,150
"Dammit"?! You don't have
to get upset or anything!

92
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,060
Let's hurry, Nami-kun!

93
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,720
Hey, wait up!

94
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,090
I got it! I got it!

95
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,050
Hey, be quiet. That wolf's gonna come after us!

96
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,250
Maybe I should kill them after all.

97
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,990
Now you've gone and done it...

98
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
Ten Finger Pistol!

99
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,330
Troisième... Haché!

100
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,350
Iron Body!

101
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,780
That doesn't work on me, you fool!

102
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,940
What's with his kicks?

103
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,850
That technique you guys use
to make your body like iron...

104
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,860
...is really a pain in the ass.

105
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,950
Tempest Kick Lone Wolf!

106
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,460
Basses Côte!

107
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,790
Longe!

108
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,920
Tendron!

109
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,130
Flanchet! Quasi! Queue! Cuisseau! Jarret!

110
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,810
Veau... Shot!

111
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,770
Iron Body Kenpo!

112
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,950
I said your kicks don't work on me, didn't I?!

113
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,400
Wolf Fang!

114
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,780
Now that attack worked, didn't it?!

115
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,150
That was Iron Body Kenpo! Wolf Fang Stance!

116
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm the only one of the Six Powers Masters

117
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,750
who can move around while using
Iron Body on my entire body.

118
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,090
Stop your rambling!

119
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,050
Deuxième Haché!

120
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,730
It appears to have worked,
but it actually didn't?

121
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,650
Well, did it or didn't it?!

122
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,120
Well done.

123
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,690
I've been waiting for a man like you.

124
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,330
Hm?

125
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,280
Would you save her... Save Robin?

126
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,720
What?! What're you saying?

127
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,180
I kept quiet about this, but... Robin is...

128
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,190
...actually my little sister... whom I
was separated from a long time ago.

129
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,980
What?!

130
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,570
Is that true?!

131
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,960
I didn't know.

132
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,670
She never told us anything like that, so...

133
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,990
That's just natural...

134
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,820
...but it's true.

135
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,840
It was over twenty years ago.

136
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,290
I'll never forget.

137
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,790
On an island in the West Blue,

138
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,000
on a sunny, pleasant summer day,

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,580
Robin and I went to a beach to play.

140
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,180
--Big brother!
--My sister and I were close.

141
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,140
--Robin!
--So we always played together.

142
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,070
--Look!
--On that day, too, we both were happy...

143
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,450
...until those guys came.

144
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,620
When I took my eyes off of her for a second...

145
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,040
...those pirates kidnapped Robin!

146
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,960
Robin! Give Robin back!

147
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,220
After that day, I never saw her again.

148
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,320
When I found out that she
escaped from those pirates,

149
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,740
--Robin...
--...it was too late.

150
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,250
It was all my fault.

151
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,850
So I wanna save her at any cost,

152
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,200
but I can't do anything due to
the position I'm in right now.

153
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,440
So... I'll entrust everything to you.

154
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,390
Please, save her!

155
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,270
Okay, I got it. Just leave it to me.

156
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,730
I'll take this key and save her without fail.

157
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,480
You think I'd buy that crap?!

158
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,030
Robin-chan is your little sister?

159
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
You dumbass! If you're gonna lie,
try to make it more believable.

160
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,460
Seriously, after coming this far,
you're still causing me trouble,

161
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,400
you dumb woman!

162
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,440
Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb woman!

163
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,490
I'm getting pretty exhausted because of you!

164
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,200
Walk on your own, bitch!

165
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,660
Don't make me repeat it.

166
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,870
There isn't even a shred of hope left for you.

167
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,260
I heard some voice in the passage earlier,

168
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,890
but no one showed up after all, did they?

169
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,980
Lucci might be killing him right about now, huh?

170
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,300
You bitch! You made me
have to do all that coughing!

171
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,260
Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb woman!

172
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,650
Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb woman!!

173
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,340
You should have realized by now.

174
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,900
No matter what tricks you play,
you can never go through these doors.

175
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,660
You're wrong! I'll do whatever
it takes to go through there!

176
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,340
It seems that we disagree.

177
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,290
I guess there's no point in discussing it.

178
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,440
I don't have much time, either.

179
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,130
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

180
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,960
Stamp!

181
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,550
Whip!

182
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,220
Spear!

183
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,280
Did it work a little this time, wolf?

184
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,250
Whoa! You bastard! The key...!

185
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,040
You gave it to me!

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,540
How dare you...?!

187
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,500
You still haven't learned your lesson?

188
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,960
Iron Body!

189
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,680
--See ya!
--Ahh! Hold it!

190
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm the one who has the trademark on foul play!

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,440
How dare you mock me?! Shave!

192
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,410
Party Table...!

193
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,510
Iron Body Kenpo!

194
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,240
Hm?!

195
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,530
Cuisseau Shoot!

196
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,830
Brochette!

197
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,920
Dammit! I'm pissed!

198
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,280
If you wanna get hurt that badly... that's fine.

199
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,970
I'll show you the true power
of my Iron Body Kenpo!

200
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,190
Iron Body Kenpo! Wolf Plantain Stance!

201
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,320
Wolf Hunt High-Speed Scratch!

202
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,480
Whoa! A slashing attack?!

203
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,160
Don Po Ro!

204
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,980
What do you think of the
power of an Iron Body punch?

205
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,920
It's incomparably powerful, isn't it?

206
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,970
Moon Walk!

207
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,910
Tempest Kick! Lupus Fall!

208
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,370
You were naive to think that you
could steal the key from me and run.

209
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm a wolf. I'll keep going
after you until I chew you up.

210
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,410
Oh? You're still alive.

211
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,210
I don't intend to run...
I don't intend to be killed...

212
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,890
And I don't intend to forgive.

213
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,280
Forgive?

214
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,130
Are you sympathizing with Nico Robin?

215
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,590
A distracted mind just creates
openings during a fight.

216
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,250
If you have time to pity that ill-fated woman,

217
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,530
you should think of a way
to save your neck here.

218
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,910
Watch your mouth.

219
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,430
I'm the kind who heats up with anger.

220
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,090
If you're under strain, there's no
chance you can bring me down.

221
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,780
I'm sure my attacks have done
quite a bit of damage to you by now.

222
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,940
If that wasn't enough, then...

223
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,280
Iron Body Kenpo! Devil Wolf!

224
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,410
Go ahead and laugh while you can.

225
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,920
Hm?

226
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't know what's so fun
about spinning like that, but...

227
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,930
Hm? What's with him?
One of his feet is now red!

228
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,100
Devil's foot...

229
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,890
Diable Jambe!

230
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,980
The heat generated from spinning
will make my fast kicks even more...

231
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,400
It's glowing!

232
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,620
Ow, it burns!

233
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,590
Its destructive power is just like that of a devil.

234
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,270
It burns! Ow, ow, ow...!

235
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,570
I-I got burned! Even my bones
feel hot! They're broken!

236
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,780
Iron Body isn't working at all!

237
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,780
What's with that kick?! Dammit!

238
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,880
How stupid!

239
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,040
To think that he jumps into the air
when he's fighting a Six Powers Master!

240
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,950
Diable Jambe!

241
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,880
--Première Haché!
--Moon Walk!

242
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,840
How stupid!

243
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,550
You're really stupid!

244
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,830
You got carried away and became
hasty trying to finish the fight!

245
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,850
I win!

246
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,600
Take this! Moonlight Ten Finger Pistol!

247
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,400
One of my hands got repelled.
You were close, huh?

248
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,090
If you were fast enough
to get another kick in,

249
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,360
you could've completely
stopped the Finger Pistol.

250
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, I couldn't help it...

251
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,370
...because the other kick is...
for finishing you off!

252
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,600
Diable Jambe!

253
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,420
What? W-Wait!

254
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,380
Flambage...

255
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,460
...Shot!

256
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,480
God creates food...

257
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,210
...and the Devil creates spice.

258
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,280
I guess I made it a little too spicy.

259
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,340
What're you doing?
My attack has already started.

260
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,430
--What?!
--Kirin Shower!

261
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,600
I can't block them!

262
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,550
I'm just starting to show a
giraffe's real wild strength!

263
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,030
On the next episode of One Piece!

264
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,080
"Fierce Sword Attacks! Zoro vs. Kaku,
Powerful Sword Fighting Showdown"

265
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,140
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
