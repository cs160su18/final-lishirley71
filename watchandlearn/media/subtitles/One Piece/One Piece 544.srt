00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
It's not our way to worry

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,560
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,900
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,660
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,790
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after Shirahoshi,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,620
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,880
Boss!

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,850
"The Sun Pirates Split! Jimbei vs. Arlong!"

82
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:23,650
And so that was how the captain of
the Sun Pirates - Fisher Tiger died.

83
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,620
The captain's death.

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,500
I think you all must know
how painful it was...

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,960
...for the crew who were left behind.

86
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,600
What are you going?!

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,770
"Don't kill humans"?!

88
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,030
See what happens when
you show mercy to them?!

89
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,820
Brother Tai was a fool!

90
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,160
Arlong-san!

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Arlong-san!

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,380
Arlong-san!!

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,930
I won't forgive them at any cost!

94
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,650
Get ready, you bastards!

95
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,780
You're the Fish-Man...

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,710
So noisy!

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,680
You're Arlong, aren't you?

98
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,680
What brought you here?
Why did you come back so...

99
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,150
THE NAVY HQ VICE ADMIRAL
BORSALINO (FUTURE ADMIRAL KIZARU)

100
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,150
...nonchalantly?

101
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm gonna kill all the people
who betrayed Big Brother Tai!

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I'm gonna go to that island too!

103
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,790
So you're seeking revenge?

104
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,040
That's right! Fisher Tiger is dead!

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,080
You lowly creatures killed him!

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,130
Oh I see, he's dead.

107
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,930
But you need to come with me now.

108
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,720
Enraged by Fisher Tiger's death,

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,310
Arlong lashed out against
humans and he was imprisoned.

110
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,990
He could've survived if he hadn't
been refused a transfusion.

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,110
Fisher Tiger didn't have to die
if there was Fish-Man's blood.

112
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,240
You humans killed him!

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,830
"Fisher Tiger,
the Captain of the Sun Pirates,

114
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,840
Dies After Being Denied a
Transfusion of Human Blood."

115
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,130
Not too far from the truth.

116
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,680
The cause of his death was related to humans.

117
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,180
Arlong told the Navy a lie...

118
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,430
The truth was far more tragic.

119
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,360
Tiger was betrayed by humans so he
refused their blood because he had

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,190
hard feelings against them.

121
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,990
Plus, he was a slave.

122
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,320
If that became public,
it would have stained Boss' honor.

123
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,620
That's why Arlong told a lie.

124
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,790
Captain Jimbei! There is an enemy ship!

125
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,130
Even without the Boss,
there is no turning back now!

126
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,050
Prepare for action!

127
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,470
Don't kill anybody!

128
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah!

129
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,310
I start identifying myself as
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei

130
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,980
and as the captain of the Sun Pirates,

131
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,700
I did nothing but fight, day in and day out.

132
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,580
THE FISHMAN ISLAND - THE RYUGU PALACE

133
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,580
"I am writing this because..."

134
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,960
"...I thought that you two deserved
to know the whole truth."

135
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,920
"The Sun Pirates captain - Jimbei."

136
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,380
My mind is set.

137
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,930
I guess Tiger had no choice but
to live the way he did-jamon.

138
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,270
Now I understand what was going
through his mind that day.

139
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,660
I'll be alright! I will not give in!

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,740
We shall live under the sun!

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,830
The day that humans and we
understand each other will come!

142
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,630
Sign here to show that you want to relocate!

143
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,670
That's impossible, Otohime-sama!
We just can't!

144
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,550
Humans refused to help
Tiger-san who saved slaves

145
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,640
of all races without discrimination!

146
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,220
How could we understand them?!

147
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,270
Another day without any signature.

148
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,610
Mother-sama!

149
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,770
My sweet babies!

150
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,610
Mother-sama, are you okay?

151
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,490
Are you okay? Are you okay?

152
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,950
You look very tired.

153
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,250
You're my consolation!

154
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,830
But I'm fine!

155
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,250
Mother-sama!

156
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,050
Mother-sama!

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
I promise you...

158
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,220
...a great future!

159
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,930
Queen Otohime was working
so hard day after day.

160
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,320
Rescuing humans from shipwrecks...

161
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,620
--Are you alright?!
--It was pirates again.

162
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,250
--Help me...
--Of course, we will help you.

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,870
Let's take them to the island!

164
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,050
Teaching the island children
about the world above...

165
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,050
Like I taught you yesterday, this is
an area with many trees called forest.

166
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,430
Forest? The Sea Forest?

167
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,600
Collecting signatures...

168
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,640
Wait!

169
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,730
It'll only take a minute!

170
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,690
However...

171
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,240
Queen Otohime!

172
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, you folk are the ones
who signed it, aren't you?

173
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,290
We need to ask you a favor.

174
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,660
How many signatures have you got so far?

175
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,870
I have been doing this for 5 years

176
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,550
but on about 100 sheets of paper
there are 10 signatures each.

177
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,760
Which means there are 1000 supporters.

178
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,720
The population of the Fish-Man Island is
5 million so, to be honest, I'd prefer more...

179
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,770
Now, here is what we have to ask you.

180
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,400
We're afraid we want to withdraw
our signatures - which amount to

181
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,230
about half of what you have.

182
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,820
What?

183
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,030
You haven't heard yet?
The pirates who arrived the other day...

184
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,910
...committed a robbery in this
town and got away from the island.

185
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,130
Queen Otohime...

186
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,050
Queen Otohime!

187
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,510
Oh kids! Do you want to hear
about the world above?

188
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,350
Um... My mom wants the paper
that I signed the other day!

189
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,730
My mom wants it!

190
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,900
What do you want?

191
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,780
I listened to you because you're the Queen...

192
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,290
But we have problems with humans...

193
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
We don't wanna...

194
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,210
...Hear your speech anymore.

195
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,670
We are tired of it.

196
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,850
Welcome home, Mother-sama!

197
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,320
I worked so hard today! I'm home, my angels!

198
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,900
I think I overdid it...
Could you leave me alone for today?

199
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,850
You are all liars!!

200
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,070
Otohime-sama! You're on the air
- the whole country heard it!

201
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,160
Shurrup!

202
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,790
Minister of the Left!

203
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,520
A-Are you drunk?!

204
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm alright!

205
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,900
Shurrup! I'm not... I'm not drunk!

206
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Yes, you are!

207
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,490
--What is that?
--Is that Otohime-sama?

208
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,870
Everybody, listen!

209
00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:01,790
We... We are capable of staying
in the water forever if we want!

210
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,340
But in the ocean so broad,

211
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,680
and on the seafloor so dark,

212
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,730
we chose to live in this
limited area... Do you know why?!

213
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,230
Otohime-sama...

214
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:29,780
Isn't it because there is some light and air?

215
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,290
But there is more light above ground,
and the sky is higher!

216
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:52,300
Why do our children sneak
out to see the Sabaody Park?

217
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:59,220
There are more beautiful places
than we can imagine in the world!

218
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,440
There is no place that we should not go...

219
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,400
You are just making convenient
excuses to convince yourself

220
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,120
and giving everything up!

221
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,490
Have courage!

222
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,250
And go for what you truly want!

223
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,960
Your Majesty...

224
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,630
If humans stand in your way,
let's face them together!

225
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:41,520
Then maybe we can make a difference for
the future of the children on this island,

226
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,400
even just a small one!

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,670
I left my family behind
on the Fish-Man Island.

228
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,340
My kid and wife... I wonder
how they are doing.

229
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,550
But you can go home someday.

230
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,850
We former slaves will get
killed if they find us.

231
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:27,310
So whether we want it or not, we have to
keep sailing for the rest of our lives.

232
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.

233
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,740
THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS

234
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Are you alright now?

235
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
It was awful.

236
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,250
I can't believe that you got beaten so bad.

237
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:51,090
Arlong, who was locked up in Impel
down the other day, is nothing.

238
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,550
The most violent one is Jimbei!

239
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,640
He was unbelievably strong.

240
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,180
It's too dangerous to have him at large.

241
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,310
Hmm...

242
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,070
UNCLEAR JUSTICE

243
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,740
They want me to join the Seven Warlords?!

244
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,910
Your bounty was raised
to 250 million berries!

245
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,710
They figured that you're gonna be an
even bigger threat to the Government.

246
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,170
They finally got it!

247
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:37,670
Let's turn them down and gain
more notoriety, Captain Jimbei!

248
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,510
No, I think I'm gonna take the offer.

249
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,140
What?!

250
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,850
Welcome back, Jimbei!
I heard about the Seven Warlords.

251
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:55,730
If I join the Warlords, Aladdin and the
others who don't want to be pirates...

252
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,820
...can live in this country without being
chased under the amnesty of the Government.

253
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,450
More importantly, if I become a Warlord,

254
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,170
the Fish-Man can get closer
to the World Government.

255
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,960
For the good of the Queen who
we've caused so much trouble.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Thank you.

257
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,180
She's not feeling well now.

258
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,140
And it could make the late
Tiger's dream come true -

259
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,600
liberation and freedom for the Fish-Man!

260
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,150
But at the same time, I think the amnesty
would cause us some trouble too...

261
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,910
IMPEL DOWN

262
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,120
--Arlong-san!
--Arlong!

263
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,080
Arlong-san!

264
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,130
--Arlong-san!
--Arlong-san is back! He's back!

265
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,630
Arlong-san!

266
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,640
If you've got something to say, just say it!

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,390
You're gonna join the Warlords,
huh? Brother Jimbei.

268
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,900
You're gonna be the
Government's dog, aren't you?!

269
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,270
Don't you remember what Brother Tai said?

270
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,690
Don't let resentment and
anger get the better of you!

271
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,490
You've gotten soft, Brother.

272
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:31,540
I know I'd be safe if I just
followed you, but I refuse!

273
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,330
Big Brother is dead!

274
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,710
I'll lead the Arlong Pirates again!

275
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,800
I'll take my men with me.

276
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,510
So this is it.

277
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,050
Arlong, you fool...

278
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,350
If you really wanna stop
me, you better kill me...

279
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,980
...right now!

280
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,440
A-Arlong-san!

281
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,900
If you can't do it, I'm free to go.

282
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,120
I represent the anger of the Fish-Man!

283
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,740
How arrogant you are!

284
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,870
Jimbei-san!

285
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,710
That's great!

286
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,810
Jimbei-san!

287
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,940
Stop it!

288
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,710
Just take him away now!

289
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,590
Arlong-san!

290
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,090
Don't worry, Jimbei.

291
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,850
You two grew up together and
he's like a brother to you.

292
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,680
No wonder you couldn't just kill
him even though you were justified.

293
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,900
Why can't that fool understand...

294
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,520
...what Brother Tai truly meant?!

295
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,200
Wherever he goes, as long as he engages
in violence, the Navy won't leave him alone.

296
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,660
Or if that doesn't work,
let's go and stop him ourselves...

297
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,410
...at any cost!

298
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:45,050
Well, well, we'll go our own way,
just like we used to, Captain Jimbei!

299
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,880
Macro, you...

300
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,340
Let them go!

301
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,760
Bye!

302
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,810
Damn, he's like a monster...

303
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,810
Hachi, let's go.

304
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,910
The Sun Pirates split into three groups

305
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,790
and went separate ways.

306
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,370
Because of Jimbei's status
as one of the Seven Warlords,

307
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,630
he is able to safely bring the
former slave Fish-Men home.

308
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,890
Just as Otohime's ideal future
had seemed one step closer,

309
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,310
a drifting ship arrived.

310
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,560
On board is a Celestial Dragon
who thinks of Fish-Men as

311
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,190
nothing more than slaves!

312
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,020
"Shaking Fish-Man Island!
A Celestial Dragon Drifts In!"

314
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,070
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
