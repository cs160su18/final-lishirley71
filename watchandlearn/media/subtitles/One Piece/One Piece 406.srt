2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,360
"Feudal Era Side Story -
Boss Luffy Appears Again"

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,120
Greetings once again!

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
It is the height of summer in the
legendary city of Grand Jipang,

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,970
a veritable mishmash of cultures
from all places and all times.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,170
Everyone appears to be as heated up
and energetic as the great sun itself,

43
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,950
but why might that be?

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,640
Big news! Big news!

45
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,790
Big news!

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Great Portable Shrine Race?

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,530
Yeah! The whole town is abuzz
with the news about it!

48
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,940
Oh? It's a big race that takes
place once every 100 years?

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,940
I've heard about that! They
say the prize is incredible!

50
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,420
Supposedly, the winners get to ask
the Grand Shrine's sacred treasure

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,420
for any wish they want!

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,820
It'll grant any wish?

53
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,700
Here you are! Have some cold water!

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,690
Oh! Thanks!

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,180
That's good!

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,320
You sure are thoughtful! Who are you?

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,920
She's our newest hired hand.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,660
I'm Omao. It's nice to meet you!

59
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,730
Seconds!

60
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,680
Here you are!

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,490
A heaping bowl! Awesome!

62
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,890
What good service!

63
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,410
Yum! Yum!

64
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,170
You don't need to give him so
much extra food, Omao-chan.

65
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,110
He's just going to put it on
his tab without paying his bill.

66
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,240
Okay!

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,790
So, what is this sacred treasure?

68
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,660
Oh, right...

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,420
They say that the sacred treasure has
the magical power to grant any wish.

70
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,220
It's kept in the Grand Shrine's treasure
room, which is opened once a century.

71
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,700
One policeman supposedly
made it big and became a samurai

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,100
after his wish was granted,

73
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,630
and one cook married the
prettiest girl in town

74
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,170
and lived in complete happiness!

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,860
That sounds great!

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,350
That sounds neat!

77
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,570
Alright! Let's enter the
Great Portable Shrine Race!

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,030
Forget it!

79
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,670
I refuse to take part in a sweaty
competition for something so suspicious!

80
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,530
The winners also receive
one million Ryo-Berries.

81
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,690
C'mon, you guys! Let's get ready!

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,970
We're gonna win the
Great Portable Shrine Race!

83
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,420
She suddenly has life in her...

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,740
Okay, we'll need a great
portable shrine if we want to win!

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,490
So, where are we going, Onami?

86
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,480
--The lumberyard.
--Lumberyard?!

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,650
I hear the greatest builder
in all of Jipang lives there!

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,080
Hello!

89
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,300
Is there no one home?

90
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,150
Wh-What is this?!

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Oh, what a nice roll of fabric!

92
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,680
Oh, sorry 'bout that!

93
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,250
Oh, you picked it up for me? Thanks, girlie!

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,250
It went flying off when I tried drying it

95
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,760
with my Special Franky Workshop
Super Drying Clockwork Mechanism!

96
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
Master Builder!

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,010
--You shouldn't go out in public...
--...looking like that!

98
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,530
That was a close call...

99
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,870
You didn't make it in time!

100
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, girlie. Could I have that back?

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,130
Eh?

102
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,710
That.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,060
This?

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,010
It is my loincloth, after all! Super!

105
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,620
L-L-L...

106
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,820
Loincloth?!

107
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,500
Awesome! What's this doohickey?!

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,110
It's my Super Drying Clockwork
Mechanism Fun Fan Sunny Wind!

109
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,880
It's so cool!

110
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,340
The loincloth...

111
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,110
The loincloth landed right on my face...

112
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,660
So, what kind of super portable
shrine do you want me to make?

113
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,330
Well, one that's...

114
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,390
One that can win!

115
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah! One that's super cool and
that can absolutely win for sure!

116
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,420
Yes, that's easy to say,

117
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,840
but the other people participating
in the race sound tough.

118
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,440
The legendary Flying Fish Riders,
the fastest gang in Grand Jipang.

119
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,780
Rolling Express, who are speedy
when it comes to love and work.

120
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,110
Oh! I like you!

121
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,960
Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,880
They're all especially quick people.

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,980
There are many other rivals, too.

124
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,710
Thriller Company?

125
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,260
Who? I've never heard of them before...

126
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,910
Who're you guys?

127
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,450
They're the ones you were just talking about.

128
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,050
They're Thriller Company.
They specialize in import wholesale.

129
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,000
They moved into the 13-story tower
built over in the Foreign District.

130
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,340
Eh?! Does that mean you guys came
to ask for a portable shrine too?!

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,800
Our portable shrine has long been completed!

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,050
We're here today to warn you
that it's pointless to enter the race!

133
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,170
What?! What do you mean?!

134
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,400
Yeah! There's no way to know until we try!

135
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,330
Nice and feisty...

136
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,110
Just my type!

137
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,790
In any case, it's in your best
interest to heed our advice!

138
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,420
You don't want to get hurt, now do you?!

139
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,330
Hold on, Cindry-chan.
Why are you in front of me?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,570
You don't scare us!

141
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,550
We have Boss Luffy on our side!
He's a policeman!

142
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,390
Let us leave for now!

143
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,040
But you'll be sorry if you
dare oppose Thriller Company!

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,910
Hey.

145
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,590
Your friends left.

146
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,600
Th-They ditched me?!

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,320
A-All right! You've been warned!

148
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,520
What was that?!

149
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,970
What a weirdo!

150
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,150
It doesn't get any creepier than that!

151
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,940
It almost sounds like they'll
try and mess with us...

152
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,230
Listen, guys!

153
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,210
Don't you dare lose to those creepy freaks!

154
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,620
I'm gonna make you guys
a super portable shrine!

155
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,860
One that definitely has a chance
of winning! So you better win!

156
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,550
Of course we will!

157
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,420
Let's win this thing, everyone!

158
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,330
Yeah!

159
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,570
Come on!

160
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,240
Come on! Come on! Come on!

161
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,850
I can't hear you!

162
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,740
How annoying.

163
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,680
What's all the noise?

164
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,190
Stop! Stop!

165
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
That's a lame chant! What are
you, palanquin carriers?!

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,180
Right, sir!

167
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,070
But we couldn't think of anything else...

168
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,940
There's gotta be something
better that's more worthy

169
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,410
of the Flying Fish Riders,
the fastest gang in all of Jipang!

170
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,210
Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome!

171
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,940
--That's it! Say it more!
--Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome!

172
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,510
Just a bunch of idiots...

173
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,320
Now victory in the portable
shrine race is as good as ours!

174
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,390
And then...!

175
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,720
Duval-sama! You're so wonderful!

176
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,850
I declare my love for you!

177
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,090
All those who want a kiss, form a line!

178
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,420
Oh! You cut in line!

179
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,220
You know that's naughty of you!

180
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,960
Wh-What's going on?!

181
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,350
Boss! We're suddenly missing four people!

182
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,960
What?! Count again!

183
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,440
One!

184
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,290
Two!

185
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,460
Three!

186
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,480
Four!

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,540
Five!

188
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,570
Six!

189
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,670
Seven!

190
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,890
See? You're all here!

191
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,500
So we are!

192
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,770
Who're you guys?!

193
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,780
Just some zombies passing by.

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,480
Z-Zom...?

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,690
Wh-What did you do with our friends?!

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,610
I'm sorry for acting so tough...

197
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,850
I'm sorry for being loud every night...

198
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,910
I just wanted someone to
pay attention to me...

199
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,840
Please dry me overnight and
then make a broth out of me...

200
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,730
Why're you guys so down in the dumps?!

201
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,590
Because I did this!

202
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,180
Negative Hollow!

203
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,090
--Negative! Negative!
--I'm depressed... Totally depressed...

204
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,180
--Negative! Negative!
--Extremely depressed...

205
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,020
Boss?!

206
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,020
Carrying shrines or winning races
won't help us make it in this world!

207
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,160
This junk is nothing but a pipe dream!

208
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,130
Boss!

209
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,300
That's another one down!

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,420
Nothing's biting...

211
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,070
I got one!

212
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,170
Alright, you!

213
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,890
Whoa, it's huge!

214
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,790
I won't let you beat me!

215
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,330
Bones... on... a...

216
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,220
--piece... of... wood...
--Help...

217
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,170
...me...

218
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,990
He sure eats a lot...

219
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,070
He sure does.

220
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,660
This guy doesn't know the
first thing about manners!

221
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,040
Geez, no one decent ever comes here!

222
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,740
You sure do eat a lot!

223
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,130
More yakitori!

224
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,750
Don't eat with him!

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
Here's the bill!

226
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,140
Why me?!

227
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,380
My, how delectable!

228
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,920
That was truly delic--

229
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,820
Oh, how rude of me.

230
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,050
You got that right!

231
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,160
Who are you, anyway?!

232
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,610
Oh, please excuse my late introduction.

233
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,860
It is a pleasure to meet you.

234
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,740
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.

235
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,860
I was born in...

236
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
I was born in...

237
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,740
I forget.

238
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
What?!

239
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,900
If you're gonna introduce yourself,
do it all the way to the end!

240
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,260
That makes me feel sick!

241
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,010
I only remember my name.

242
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,600
It's possible that some sort of shock
caused you to lose your memory!

243
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,520
Say, is it just me, or is something
inside your head making a sound?

244
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
Maybe you have a screw loose?

245
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,610
Eh?! That's not good!

246
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,650
It opens up?!

247
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,260
Awesome!

248
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,920
Oh! I found this in there!

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,780
It's a sideways flute...

250
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,740
A flute?

251
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,950
Here we go...

252
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,700
How do things work in there?!

253
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,500
You're a funny guy!

254
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,930
Well?

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,050
Looks pretty good on you!

256
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,940
"Portable Shrine Race Participants"
"Fang-Frog Shipping Agency"
"Big Helmet Clan"

257
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,760
"Flying Fish Riders"

258
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
The Flying Fish Riders have dropped out too.

259
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,890
That just leaves the Rolling Express
and Pinwheel Eatery teams!

260
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,800
Once they're out of the way,
victory will belong to Thriller Company!

261
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,800
"Rolling Express"
"Pinwheel Eatery"

262
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,050
The race is tomorrow.

263
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,260
Let's go finish our work now, Absalom.

264
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,480
I don't need you to tell me that.

265
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,960
Things are going to be fun tonight!

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,910
Oh, Cindry-chan.
Why do you keep getting in front?

267
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,800
I've brought some food, everyone!

268
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,790
Oh! Thanks!

269
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,770
Lucky!

270
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,880
"Express Delivery"

271
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,320
Who's taking our shrine?!

272
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,440
No idea!

273
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,380
Is it a thief?!

274
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,880
I-It's floating!

275
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,030
I'm stuffed! That was great!

276
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,520
Simply being with you
makes me overeat as well!

277
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,570
You guys do eat too much!

278
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,540
Wh-What the...?

279
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,000
A portable shrine is flying off!

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,360
Stop!

281
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,060
Come back, portable shrine!

282
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,840
Let's follow it!

283
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,940
Yeah!

284
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,560
Oh, you're wonderful! Marry me!

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,510
No way.

286
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,140
Rejection!

287
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,700
That's her 4,450th rejection!

288
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,040
This thing... sure is heavy...

289
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
Get back here!

290
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,910
Stop, you portable shrine!

291
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,210
Who're you guys?

292
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,040
They're...!

293
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,270
How frightening! Zombies!

294
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

295
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,860
Wow! You're awesome, Brook!

296
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,670
Huh?

297
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,990
How did I know how to do that?

298
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,530
Hey, you guys!

299
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,190
What's all the ruckus?!

300
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,940
Onami! Sanji!

301
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,240
What the...?!

302
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,390
Marry me...!

303
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,670
This is horrible...

304
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,210
It's all over!

305
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,700
We can't enter the race like this!

306
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,030
Our only choice is to drop out now...

307
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,900
When will I finally get to marry someone?!

308
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,900
If this was all meant to destroy
their portable shrine before the race...

309
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,530
...then ours is in danger too!

310
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,510
No, Omao-chan is in bigger trouble!

311
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,190
Omao-chan?

312
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,990
She hasn't returned from delivering
meals to the Franky Workshop,

313
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,120
so we were just on our
way to check things out!

314
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,750
Look out! Outta the way, outta the way!

315
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,210
Omao-chan!

316
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,210
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

317
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,400
Boss! Franky-san and the others are...!

318
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,430
Get Dr. Bluenose right away!

319
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,190
Right!

320
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,030
Hey, you alright?

321
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,370
My head hurts...

322
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,310
I'm bleary-eyed...

323
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,190
I don't have eyes, though,
as I'm nothing but bones...

324
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,870
I'd say you're too okay.

325
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,080
I remember.

326
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,670
Your memory is back?!

327
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,940
Yes.

328
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,200
I remember everything now.

329
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,540
Wh-What's with that get-up?
Where are you going?

330
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,050
I should not be here.

331
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,080
This is because...

332
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
...I'm actually a member of Thriller Company.

333
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,150
What?!

334
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,960
Brook-san...

335
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,590
Come on, now!

336
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,680
That's not a very funny joke!

337
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,050
Thank you for everything.

338
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,140
Hey...!

339
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,010
"To Be Continued"

340
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,650
What's with those Thriller Company guys?

341
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,190
Destroying the portable shrines
so they can win without trying...

342
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,650
That's beyond cowardly!

343
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,180
Yeah! They won't get away with this!

344
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,800
We'll win this fight!

345
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,860
Everybody, attack!

346
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,850
Do it yourself!

347
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,370
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,970
"Feudal Era Side Story -
Defeat Thriller Company's Trap"

349
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm gonna be a detective!
