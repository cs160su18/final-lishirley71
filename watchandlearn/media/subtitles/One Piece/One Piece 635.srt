We are the one! Go ahead!

morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel
something - that's the treasure

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

and go wherever you want to
go - that's the adventure

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,480
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,720
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,860
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,880
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,320
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,100
When Luffy found out that the prize for a

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,490
fighting event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,240
Are you interested in that guy?

79
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,610
Who are you?

80
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,370
I'm Rebecca. A gladiator.

81
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,240
This man was a legend.

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,160
A legend? This old man?

83
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,780
He was the strongest
gladiator in the history

84
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,830
of the Corrida Colosseum, named Kyros.

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,800
The winner of the Block
A battle group emerged:

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
Burgess from the Blackbeard Pirates.

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,560
Now, the battle of Block B is about to start.

88
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,570
Meanwhile...

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
Hey.

90
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm not blind.

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,330
No matter how you disguise yourself,

92
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,700
I can't help recognizing the face of the guy...

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,330
...who put a blot on my record!

94
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,970
You!

95
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,830
"The Fateful Reunion!
Bellamy the Hyena!"

96
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,950
SCENE-1
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

97
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,130
You...

98
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,320
...gave the diamond-head pops hell.

99
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,940
I'll be back by morning!

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,950
A city of gold? A sky island?!

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,750
The era of dreams is over,
you pathetic excuses for pirates!

102
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,100
Your name was...

103
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,650
...Maro.

104
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,990
-Bellamy!

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,410
Oh yeah, Bellamy!

106
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,660
Why are you here?!

107
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,090
No particular reason.

108
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,090
THE FORMER CAPTAIN OF THE BELLAMY PIRATES

109
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm not a resident of Jaya.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,120
BELLAMY THE HYENA
BOUNTY: 195 MILLION BERRIES

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,220
I can be wherever I want.

112
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,140
On top of that,

113
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,510
Doflamingo has been my pirate hero
since I was a kid.

114
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,730
I've no interest in the Flare-Flare Fruit

115
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,270
but I have my own reason to win this thing!

116
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,710
Well, then I'll have to just fight you again!

117
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,430
But I'm not the man I used to be.

118
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,270
Straw Hat.

119
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,880
I visited the Sky Island.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
You mean Skypiea?!

121
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,660
I lost my crew but it turned my
view of the world upside down.

122
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,180
You didn't do anything to
the people there, did you?!

123
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,150
Maybe. Maybe not.

124
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,300
Anyway, I'm not holding a grudge
against you anymore.

125
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,990
I'm gonna get on board Doflamingo's
ship to ride through

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,030
the "wild wave" that will come soon or later.

127
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm done picking on you.

128
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,310
Hey.

129
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,750
AT A CAFE IN THE NORTHEAST

130
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,390
SCENE-2
CAESAR HANDOVER TEAM

131
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,400
Green Bit?

132
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,300
I don't recommend you to go there.

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,280
Are you people researchers or explorers?

134
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,200
Yes, something like that.

135
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,980
You better not go
unless you have a purpose

136
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,710
that's worth risking your life.

137
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,250
That bridge looks very strong though...

138
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,480
Yes, it's made of iron.

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,850
But, look at the entrance.
Nobody's crossing it nowadays as you see.

140
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,920
A school of Fighting Fish inhabit
the area around Green Bit.

141
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,760
Before they came,
people used to come and go freely

142
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,240
but that was 200 years ago.

143
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,230
Mister, what's a Fighting Fish?

144
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,210
It's a savage fish with horns.

145
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,420
If you approach them by a ship,
they'll capsize you.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,330
That's why they reinforced the bridge with iron
but it's no use.

147
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,750
No use?! What do you mean?!

148
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,860
Can they even tear down an iron bridge?!

149
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Well, I don't know
the current condition of the bridge.

150
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,870
Only people who crossed it know
but I don't know anyone who came back.

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
What?!

152
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,410
Hey, Tra-guy!

153
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,930
You have to change the handing-over spot now!

154
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,270
He's right!

155
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,090
Think what it's like to be handed
over at such a place, fool!

156
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,700
You fool!

157
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm not gonna change.

158
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,740
We're already here. Stop making a fuss.

159
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,360
More importantly,

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm worried about the situation of this country.

161
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,530
Their king quit all of a sudden.

162
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,560
How come they are so calm?

163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,700
We're in unexpected circumstances already.

164
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,240
That's what worries me!

165
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,500
What are you doing, Robin?

166
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,560
What's going on?

167
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,440
CP-0.

168
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,130
What?! "CP"?

169
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,220
The strongest intelligence
organization in the world.

170
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,520
Cipher Pol Aigis Zero!

171
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,010
D-Don't tell me they're related to CP9!

172
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,440
They're the greatest of
all of those organizations!

173
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,990
CP9 was fairly strong!
They are more formidable?!

174
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,090
When they're on the move,
nothing good happens.

175
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,600
Indeed.

176
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,420
SCENE-3
THE FAIRY AND ZORO

177
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,270
I won't let you get away, you thief-fairy!

178
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,580
Where did it go?

179
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,290
Is that it?!

180
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,970
There it is!

181
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
This is it!

182
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,140
I caught you!

183
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,630
Give me back my sword!

184
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,840
What?

185
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,890
Oh no!

186
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,320
Ow, ow, ow... This is no good!

187
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,490
I'm so dumb! This human will see me!

188
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,850
I have to run! Otherwise, the human will...

189
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,930
SCENE-4
STRAY KIN'EMON

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,940
Where are you, Kanjuro?!

191
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,610
Who are you people?

192
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm just an old man passing by!

193
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,740
Don't lie! Isn't that a
topknot under your hat?

194
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,820
N...

195
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,420
No, it's a topknot-shaped hat!

196
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,070
Then, take it off for us!

197
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,820
I can't do it - for a good reason.

198
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,980
You're a samurai - Foxfire Kin'emon,
aren't you?!

199
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,830
I am not!

200
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,830
You must confuse me with someone else!

201
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,030
We saw you in the video from Punk Hazard.

202
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,110
And we figured a samurai like
you will come back here.

203
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,840
That's what samurai do, right?

204
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
If so, what are you gonna do?

205
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Let me tell you something.

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,030
If you point your gun at a samurai,

207
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,290
you better prepare yourself for the worst!

208
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,410
Whoa, easy!

209
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,330
If you don't want Kanjuro
who you're obviously looking for, to die.

210
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,060
What?! Did you just say Kanjuro?!

211
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,740
Keep your hand away from
the sword, samurai-san.

212
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,970
You know where Kanjuro is, don't you?!

213
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,290
Of course, I do.
But if you don't listen to me,

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,580
I will kill both you and Kanjuro.

215
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,820
Now, the competitors of

216
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,060
Block B are entering the ring
one after another!

217
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,560
I gotta hurry! It's gonna start soon!

218
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,180
Oh, I have a good view from here!

219
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,630
How could you do such a
dirty thing, Navy-san?

220
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,340
You people sent in a rat to this competition

221
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,310
to arrest all the wanted pirates, didn't you?

222
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,680
What are you talking about?

223
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,580
You're good at playing dumb!

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,090
But I can't just let you go
after getting my dear subordinate beaten.

225
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,030
I guess I'd better silence you, Bartolomeo.

226
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,600
I can't believe how famous I became!

227
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,240
SCENE-5
SANJI IN LOVE

228
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,060
Violet-chan!

229
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,950
Yes?

230
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,450
No, I just wanted to call your name!

231
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,400
Oh my!

232
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,830
Sanji-san.

233
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,780
Yes?

234
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,600
I just wanted to call your name!

235
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,270
I got my sights on the target.

236
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,190
Violet-chan!

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,190
"Dear Nami-san and Robin-chan."

238
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,160
"How is the weather there?"

239
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,390
Yee-ha!

240
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,200
I can't believe it! You're very strong!

241
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,820
No no! Anybody can detect a sniper
at 16 meters above the ground!

242
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,020
It was nothing!

243
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,260
How dependable!

244
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,540
"I'm getting hit by a hurricane called love!"

245
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,280
"I'm...

246
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,220
...in love!"

247
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm here for you!

248
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,250
SCENE-6
THE SUNNY'S SECURITY TEAM

249
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,830
No, you shouldn't drink it all up!

250
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,440
What?!

251
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,790
Listen! A poison tester's job is

252
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,060
to try the food for a shogunjust a little to see

253
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,100
if there isn't any poison in it!

254
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,180
Understood?!

255
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,390
Yes, sir!

256
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,190
Do it again!

257
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,320
Get me a cup of tea, Choppa'emon.

258
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes, sir!

259
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,480
A VASSAL: CHOPPA'EMON

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
I'll bring it to you right away, sir!

261
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,890
A MAID: O-NAMI

262
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,550
Sir, how are you feeling now?

263
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,880
Ah, it's so comfortable.

264
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm feeling great.

265
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,700
Yeah? That's good.

266
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm feeling great, too!

267
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,010
Y-You hurt me, Nami-san!

268
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,590
Huh? I thought it was a
sleeping-in-your-lap party!

269
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,170
What kind of party is that?!

270
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,380
Brook.

271
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
He's playing shogun.

272
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,410
Playing shogun?

273
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,990
Whenever we leave Momo alone,
he looks very serious and depressed.

274
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,680
Maybe, he's thinking about dirty things.

275
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,730
No, he's not!
He's not gonna share it with us

276
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,930
but maybe he has had some kind
of trauma even at that young age.

277
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,960
What?!

278
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,690
I see. I didn't notice that.

279
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,430
But he tries to act cheerfully like that
because he doesn't want us to worry.

280
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,070
How touching.

281
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,890
Hey, Bone-kichi!

282
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,370
Yes?

283
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,310
Do something to warm the place up.

284
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,580
No way. I only take orders from Luffy-san...

285
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,510
Do it!

286
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,020
All right!

287
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,870
I'm gonna sing a song.

288
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,650
Ah, great!

289
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,060
Soul King!

290
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't like it
I don't like it

291
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,050
Don't like it
I don't like it

292
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,870
Doesn't matter how many times we bury him

293
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,010
He's gonna come back

294
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,140
Yeah!

295
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,050
The Vitality Corpse

296
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,630
Come on!

297
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,510
Thank you, everybody!

298
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,460
--Huh?
--What?

299
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,270
I don't like it...

300
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,430
What?!

301
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,900
What's going on?

302
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,990
I thought there are only
four of us on the ship.

303
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,850
So did I... Then what's that noise?!

304
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,870
Creepy!

305
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm scared!

306
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,450
O-Nami!

307
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,830
I don't like it... Honestly...

308
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,880
I-I-It's from the men's dormitory.

309
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,360
Oh, I don't like it!

310
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,080
There is somebody in there!

311
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,300
Who is it?

312
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,320
What the hell?!

313
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,430
What, what's going on?!

314
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,480
Chopper!

315
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,310
Bone-kichi!

316
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,500
Go look!

317
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,070
What?!

318
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,320
I think we don't have a choice.

319
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,720
Uh-huh.

320
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Wh-What's going on in here?!

321
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,900
I can't believe this.

322
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,970
You're too weak and this
is like a joke, Navy-san!

323
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,750
Competitors of Block B! Is Capman here?!

324
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,360
And Bartolomeo?!

325
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,040
You're Bartolomeo, aren't you?

326
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,840
Block B's match will start soon!

327
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,590
Okay.

328
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,860
And did you see a competitor named Capman?

329
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,080
I don't think so.

330
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,040
Can I watch it with you, Lucy?

331
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,780
Of course, you can!

332
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,740
Now, the next competitor to enter is...

333
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,830
a latecomer!
He's in Block B, too!

334
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,980
It only took him a year to become infamous
and enter the New World!

335
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,380
An incomparably brutal and crazy rookie!

336
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,480
He roasted some pirates on a skewer
and shared the video!

337
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,990
And he also bombed some innocent civilians!

338
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,680
He ranked No.1 in the "most annoying pirate
who should just go away" competition!

339
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,500
A pirate -

340
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,220
Bartolomeo!

341
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,030
All of you!

342
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,970
Go to hell!
