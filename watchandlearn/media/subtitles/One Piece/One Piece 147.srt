2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,410
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,420
Hey, Mister! We want to go to the sky island!

20
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,350
Do you know anything about it?! If you do...

21
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,230
She said "sky island"!

22
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,270
But the Log Pose is
definitely pointing to the sky!

23
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,900
Give me a break!

24
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,950
Luffy!

25
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,630
Zoro, hold on a minute!

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,750
Shut up! I'm just taking him up on his offer!

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,850
Luffy!

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,830
Get outta this town!

29
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,920
Luffy! Zoro! Forget the promise,
take care of them already!

30
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't take them on, no matter what happens.

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,760
"Distinguished Pirates! A Man Who Talks of
Dreams and the King of Undersea Search"

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,130
Look at them! They're still standing!

33
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,810
Get those clumsy chickens!

34
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,250
This town isn't for dreaming cowards!

35
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,680
What's the commotion?

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,910
I heard the Bellamy Pirates
are holding a public lynching.

37
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,090
Luffy! Zoro! Why are you
just taking this from them?!

38
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,590
Fight them! Why don't you just beat them up?!

39
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,530
It's no use, lady. They're smart.

40
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,150
They've realized that their
opponents are out of their league.

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Not fighting a strong opponent...
it's a disgraceful move, though.

42
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,580
I guess he has no dignity as a captain.

43
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,770
The Navy's generous these days,

44
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,460
giving 30 million Berries for the
head of a worthless ass like him.

45
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Zoro, don't take them on,
no matter what happens.

46
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,720
Why... are you both...?

47
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,980
The doctrine of nonresistance...
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

48
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,870
In addition to being weak, you have no pride.

49
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,210
You can't get into a single fight.

50
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,890
But your head is full of dreams.

51
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,780
You're just like worms.

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,880
Right on!

53
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,650
I'm done here.

54
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,000
A weak-looking shorty worth 30 million...

55
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,470
I wondered what kind of man he is.

56
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,270
This isn't just a letdown, it's boring!

57
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,370
I've never met cowards like them before.

58
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,700
Hey, get them out of my face.

59
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,700
They're eyesores.

60
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,230
Look at them!

61
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,900
Luffy! Zoro!

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,140
Hey, woman.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,980
You won't be able to move forward
into the new era if you're with him.

64
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,000
How about I buy you?

65
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,970
What'll it cost to have you come with me?

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,730
What was that? You're going to buy me?

67
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,800
That's right. Join us. It'll be fun.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,390
Hate to say it,

69
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,000
but I'm too good for a team
of small fries like you!

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,750
How stuck up!

71
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,440
Their gang is nothing but dumbasses!

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,180
They're hopeless!

73
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,430
Take those two and beat it already

74
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,790
while you're still alive, you small fries!

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,280
Hey, don't ever come back!

76
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,260
The sky island exists.

77
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,950
The cherry pies here really are the best!

78
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,670
You're that guy...

79
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,740
Why so angry, young lady?

80
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,410
They're the ones who won the fight.

81
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,100
What?

82
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,870
Oh? You'll surpass us?

83
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,580
We'll meet again when we
become distinguished pirates.

84
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,270
Your sharp retort was really something, too.

85
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,820
You've got nerves of steel.

86
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,090
Zoro!

87
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,210
Luffy!

88
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,990
The new era they're talking about is crap!

89
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,500
The era where pirates have dreams
will be over, they say?! Huh?!

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,390
What's going on?

91
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,520
People's dreams... have no end!!

92
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,500
Isn't that right?!

93
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,170
Hey, hey...

94
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,840
What're you suddenly shouting about?

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,020
What's this about people's dreams?

96
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,960
Outdoing others isn't easy!

97
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,470
Has your brain melted?!

98
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,730
What's going on? I hear a ruckus outside.

99
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,370
Don't bother. Those guys might be goin'
on a rampage 'cause they're pissed.

100
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,100
How sad!

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,800
They can go ahead and laugh at us.

102
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,230
When you aim high, you sometimes
come across fights not worth fighting.

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,820
Isn't that right?!

104
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,030
Let's go.

105
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,580
Y-Yeah... Luffy?

106
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,640
Luffy!

107
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,710
Oh, looks like I interrupted you.

108
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,610
Are you in a hurry?

109
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,310
I hope you can go to the sky island!

110
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,100
Ah...

111
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,290
Hey, he might've known
something about the sky island.

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,530
I wonder who he is.

113
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,860
I don't know... And it's not "he."

114
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,680
What? It's not "he"? Then what?

115
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,050
"They," probably...

116
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,140
What do you mean?!

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,620
Do you mean there were
others with him? Where?! Hey!

118
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,430
The drinks sure taste good today!

119
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,330
Panel!

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,220
Here!

121
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,290
Nail!

122
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,060
Here!

123
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,930
Panel!

124
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,670
Here!

125
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,110
The pain...!

126
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,490
Here!

127
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,900
Here...

128
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,870
Seriously... I know I'm repeating myself,
but I'm not a shipwright.

129
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,990
But you're really handy with stuff, Usopp.

130
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,500
Aren't I?! That's the amazing thing about me.

131
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,660
We should just buy a new ship instead.

132
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,760
Are you nuts?! Do you know
how we got this ship?!

133
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,330
Yeah, yeah, I've heard it so many times.

134
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,250
It was given to you guys by a
pretty girl from your village, right?!

135
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,680
But still, it's dangerous to keep
traveling on a ship in this condition.

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,720
That's why I'm repairing it!
Give us a hand here!

137
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,540
Repair? You call this repair?
You're just patching it.

138
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,380
Shut up!

139
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,790
Hey, that's a funny face, Usopp!

140
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,630
Oh, like this?

141
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,360
Shut up!

142
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,660
Oh, yeah... About tonight's dinner...

143
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,830
Shut up!

144
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,780
Oh, so you don't want any?

145
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,330
Ahhh!

146
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,470
Ahhh! We do!! Sanji-kun!!

147
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,360
Now, I wonder how the seagull
stock soup is coming along.

148
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,080
Please let us eat!!

149
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,770
Sanji-kun!!

150
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,240
Hm?

151
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,710
Salvage, salvage...

152
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,390
Salvage, salvage...

153
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,660
Wh-What's with that ship?

154
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,930
Salvage...

155
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,930
This song is...!

156
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,320
L-L-L-L-Luffy! Zoro!

157
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,110
Why are you wounded?! What happened?!

158
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,630
Nami-san! Are you all right?!

159
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,820
D-D-D-Doctor!!

160
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,200
So check them out already!

161
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,190
Ow...

162
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,520
So, what kind of Moguera
monster did you fight?

163
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,160
Pirates. But that's okay, it's all over now.

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,730
Yeah.

165
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,050
Even if it's over for you guys,
it's not over for me!

166
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,680
What's with you guys?! You're men, right?!

167
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
When someone provokes you, you should
just go ahead and beat them all up!

168
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,500
Actually, better yet, why not just
blow up this whole annoying town!!

169
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,670
So what was that stuff you said earlier?!

170
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,170
What's past is past!
Don't talk about ancient history!

171
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,500
Do you want me to floor you?!

172
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,330
Hey, what's she in such a mood
about when she's unhurt?

173
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,330
I don't know.

174
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,640
Oh, yeah! Did you get any
information about the sky island?

175
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,160
Sky... island...?

176
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,700
Who cares?! All I did was mention "sky island,"

177
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,560
and the entire bar broke out laughing.

178
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,180
Did I say something funny?!

179
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,200
What's with them?!

180
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,900
Ketchup Star!

181
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,610
Guard Point!

182
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,060
It's quite lively up there.
Why are you so upset?

183
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh! Welcome back, Robin-chan!

184
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,050
Would you like to eat first,
or shall I prepare your bath?

185
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,290
Oh, Robin, did you go somewhere?

186
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,250
Yeah. I got some clothes and
information about the sky island.

187
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,390
That's right! You, Robin!!

188
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,150
Jumping Point!

189
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,850
This all happened because you
started talking about that sky island!

190
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,230
If it doesn't exist,

191
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll send you to a watery grave!

192
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,270
Hey, Chopper!

193
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,200
Ahh, leave her alone for now!

194
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,220
Or rather, you'd better not get
close to her. Just don't rock the boat.

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,650
Here, Captain.

196
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,480
Oh! It's a treasure map!

197
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,710
Hm? Isn't it just an ordinary map? Where is it?

198
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,650
It's this island.

199
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,800
The town drawn on the left is
Mock Town, where we are now.

200
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,280
And you see an x on the other side, right?

201
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,930
I heard that a man who doesn't
blend in in Jaya lives there.

202
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,340
Doesn't blend in?!

203
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,060
His name is Montblanc Cricket.

204
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,620
A man who talked about dreams
and was driven out of this town.

205
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,310
You might have something
in common to discuss.

206
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,440
Then, why don't we try going there?

207
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,580
Hey, wait a sec, Luffy. I'm not sure
if we should go now because...

208
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,360
Hey, Chopper, you saw it
earlier, too, didn't you?

209
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,120
What're you guys doing?

210
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,820
I thought I was a goner!

211
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,460
Geez, you're such a pain.

212
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,790
But Nami was...

213
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,170
What?! What about me?!

214
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,020
You tryin' to say I'm some
simple-minded idiot?!

215
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,750
Big boss! Undersea preparations complete!

216
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,100
The mic's ready, too!

217
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,300
Alright! Starting the search sonar!

218
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,850
This is Utan Diver Number 27!
Sonar response confirmed!

219
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,850
School of fish detected at 9 o'clock!

220
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,690
From it's swimming speed,
we've determined that it's saury.

221
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,300
Alright! We'll have them
roasted whole for dinner!

222
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,130
This is Diver Number 4!
Sonar response confirmed!

223
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,310
Small sailing vessel
detected traveling on the sea!

224
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,270
What?! A vessel?
Determine the exact direction!

225
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,480
Let's see... I'd say it's at 12 o'clock!

226
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,040
It's already close enough to see!!

227
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,710
Stop the search and return
to the ship, Utan Divers!!

228
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,850
Didn't take long for us to
come across something weird...

229
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,850
But it doesn't look like the
same guys from before, Usopp.

230
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,520
Well, whether that's a good thing
or a bad thing is another story.

231
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,900
In any case, we did see them! Right?

232
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,100
Yeah. As we thought,
that salvager is from this island!

233
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,440
We saw his ship coming back!

234
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,070
I see... but I don't mind seeing him again.

235
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,070
Hey hey, you guys! Quit mumbling over there!

236
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,490
Ha! Honestly, I got all worked up
wondering who you guys were!

237
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,850
That's quite a reckless face
you've got! What species are you?

238
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,450
I'm human, you moron!

239
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,230
You punks! Don't you know Shojo-sama?!

240
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,230
He's the big boss of the Shojo Pirates
and the king of undersea search!

241
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,560
Don't make our big boss angry!

242
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,520
Now, now...

243
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,050
Looks like you're pirates.

244
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,580
Did you know that Crocodile, one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea, was defeated?

245
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:48,250
When you consider my abilities,
that post may come to me.

246
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,290
So I've been getting all worked
up waiting to be contacted.

247
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,970
I see... Then you want to become one
of the Seven Warlords of the Sea?

248
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,700
Well, in any case, the great part about me

249
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,440
is that I haven't had my hair
cut in all my 25 years of life.

250
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,750
Now, aren't you surprised?

251
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,870
Sounds stupid.

252
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,850
Whoa! I'm surprised!

253
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,820
Hey, watch your mouth!

254
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,300
Now, now... What you say
really gets me all worked up.

255
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:27,160
Listen. You will come out of the tunnel
that is my anger into a sea of blood.

256
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,810
Okay, whatever...
but there's a place we wanna go.

257
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,700
So move aside.

258
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,770
Idiot! This area is my turf!

259
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,880
If you wanna pass through, pay the toll!

260
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,310
What's he mean by his turf?
He's talking like Masira.

261
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,640
Huh? Did Masira say stuff like that?

262
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,130
What? Masira?! What about Masira?

263
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,770
We kicked him off our boat, but...

264
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,620
K-Kicked... Kicked...?!

265
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,780
Big boss!

266
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,420
Kicked?! How dare you do that to my brother?!

267
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,260
This is revenge for Masira!

268
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,260
Hey, hold on a sec.

269
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,090
We kicked him, but he's still alive!

270
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,680
Sound wave!!

271
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,300
Havoc Sonar!!

272
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,310
The ship is...!

273
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,380
So... what're they doing?

274
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,380
Big boss!

275
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,850
Who knows? But it's amazing.

276
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,210
If you use that technique on the ship, it'll...!

277
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,880
Oh, no! He's blinded by anger!

278
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,460
He's destroying their ship with his voice.

279
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Now everyone! Stop gawking and
let's get through here while we can!

280
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,810
Okay!

281
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,860
Hey, Nami's not a demon any more.

282
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,040
Really?!

283
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,080
Yeah, she should be calmer
after letting off that much steam.

284
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,870
H-Hey... hold on!

285
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,340
This isn't good! The waves
made it to this ship after all!

286
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,570
The ship's starting to fall apart,
particularly the repaired areas!

287
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,410
The ship's body is worn out enough as it is!!

288
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,340
If we stay here, the ship will be torn apart!!

289
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,970
Full speed ahead! To someplace
out of his voice's reach!

290
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,050
In any case, I was surprised.

291
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,920
Then this pretty woman says,

292
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,840
"Tell me where this Cricket lives!"

293
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,550
What a bold woman!

294
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,530
Bold? Well, she was strong!

295
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,540
She had these mysterious hands
popping out everywhere,

296
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,180
and they knocked down everyone
in the bar. It wasn't funny!

297
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,590
But what does she want
with old geezer Cricket?

298
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,740
The sea around there is the turf
of the big monkey brothers.

299
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,370
Also, if you have something
to do with that old geezer,

300
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,960
you'll catch his stupidity.

301
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,130
That'd be a problem.

302
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,350
What that woman's after is
gold bullion, no doubt about it.

303
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,290
Gold bullion?!

304
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,430
Yeah. I heard some gold
bullion was found recently.

305
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,990
Really? Where?

306
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,650
Hey, guys...

307
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,390
Bellamy!

308
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,200
What did you just say about gold bullion?

309
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,760
That Cricket guy...
I'd definitely like to meet him, too.

310
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,080
Tell me all about him!

311
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,540
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

312
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:27,570
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

313
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,490
There are days where I almost lose to myself

314
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:51,930
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

315
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,050
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

316
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:08,420
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

317
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,270
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

318
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,390
This unique moment...

319
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,650
So this is, uh... what's his name again?

320
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,710
Montblanc Cricket.

321
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,170

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,550
Wow, that's a cool name!

Oh, that brings back memories.
I read it a lot when I was a kid.

325
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,840
Do you know it?

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,550
Yeah. I heard that he was a real person.

On the next episode of One Piece!
