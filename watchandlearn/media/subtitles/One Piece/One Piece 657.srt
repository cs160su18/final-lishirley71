The unchanging bond will light up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Put the pieces of our dreams together

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,750
and if that makes you feel something - that's the treasure

The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,670
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,630
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,810
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,330
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,670
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in which a winner will get

77
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,530
the Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize - and won the first round.

78
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,900
And Rebecca, the gladiator girl Luffy supports,

79
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,520
is now fighting the last match of the first round.

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,060
I didn't know she used the Observation Haki!

81
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,980
Haki?

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,920
She has also never been
wounded by anybody

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,850
and she won it all by letting opponents fall out of the ring!

84
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,790
She has never been defeated!

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,990
Let's see what happens
if I break your bones!

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,830
Ill Weed-chan!

87
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,230
If I bring Luffy-senpai here,
can I have your autograph?

88
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,710
You can do that for me?
I'll be counting on you!

89
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm gonna bring him at the risk of my life!

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,450
I've got to do this right!

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,610
"The Most Violent Fighter!
Logan vs. Rebecca!"

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,260
I have to be careful
not to bump into Luffy-senpai.

93
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,700
Because his awesomeness might blind my eyes and make my heart explode.

94
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,580
I need to look for him with caution.

95
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,300
Come to think of it, since the captain
and the vice captain are here,

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,340
other members must be here
on the island, too.

97
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,410
Sniperking-senpai and...

98
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,850
..."Black Foot" Sanji-senpai!

99
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,880
Sis Nami!

100
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,800
The great doctor - Chopper-senpai and...

101
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,750
...Big Sis Nico Robin!

102
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,560
The great shipwright - Franky-senpai!

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,440
The great musician - Soul King - Brook-senpai!

104
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,080
I can see them, too!

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm getting really nervous!
I can't help getting excited!

106
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,640
By the way,
I know I didn't miss a thing

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,930
but why isn't there anyone here,
besides Luffy-senpai?

108
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,940
There were a whole bunch
of people here earlier.

109
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,570
Is that...

110
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,100
...a staircase?

111
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,770
I haven't been downstairs.

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,330
It's really creepy down here.

113
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,550
I don't think Luffy-senpai is here
in such a gloomy place.

114
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,450
What is it? I hear voices.

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,890
Hurry up! Out of our way!

116
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,090
Get out of our way!

117
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,510
What is this place?

118
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,730
A WAITING ROOM FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT
IN THE BASEMENT OF THE COLOSSEUM

119
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,130
Next! Come in!

120
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,190
There are so many people here.

121
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,870
Well, let's go look.

122
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,140
They're all injured.
Is Luffy-senpai here?

123
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,760
Hey, look!

124
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,850
Why is he here?! This is bad!
He's gonna agitate everybody here!

125
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,600
Mr. Bartolomeo!
Wh-Why are you here?

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm looking for someone. Excuse me.

127
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,550
Y-You shouldn't be here!

128
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,860
This is where we treat the losers!

129
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,110
If they see you...

130
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,560
Treat the losers?

131
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,810
I see! They're losers!

132
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,600
Damn you! Did you come here to make fun of us, Bartolomeo?!

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,240
You won the match with your pathetic power!

134
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,180
I'll kick your ass right here!

135
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
S-See, I told you!

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,050
Please don't cause any trouble in here!

137
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,340
All right. I think he has no business here.

138
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,860
Sorry to bother you all!

139
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,940
Get yourselves looked at!

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,050
What did he come here for?

141
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,300
Next! Mr. Sai from the Kano Kingdom!

142
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,070
Next?!

143
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,300
Our old man that you carried in
hasn't come out yet!

144
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,180
Oh, Mr. Chin Jao.

145
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,580
Is he dead?! Huh?!

146
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,080
Ah? What's going on?

147
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,780
Shut up, you martial arts fool!

148
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,910
He's quite tough but he is really old now!

149
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,170
If he's dead, don't hide it!

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,130
He's so loud.

151
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,000
You're overreacting.

152
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,250
Mr. Chin Jao hasn't come out here
because...

153
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,830
...there is an exit at the back of the room

154
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,840
and those who are treated are not coming back here.

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,470
Oh, is that so? I'm sorry.

156
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,880
Do you understand?
Then, please come in.

157
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,870
I'm sorry for getting it wrong!

158
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,260
Really, I'm sorry!
How can I even make it up to you?

159
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm on my knees! Please forgive me!

160
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,410
Don't worry!
He gets emotional easily.

161
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,430
Oh, I see...

162
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,110
This way, sir. Please come in.

163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,850
Mr. Sai from the Kano Kingdom, am I correct?

164
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,690
Yeah.

165
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,810
Lie down on the bed here.

166
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,230
Like this?

167
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,820
Yes. And close your eyes.

168
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,790
All right. We're going to start.

169
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,310
What the...

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,960
Next! Come in!

171
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,620
Ow, ow, ow...

172
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,540
What is this? A toy?
Is this a stack of toys?

173
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,800
Toys and fighters.

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,050
Who is it?

175
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,460
Hajrudin!

176
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,960
You guys?

177
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,160
Why are you all here?

178
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Old man! You're alive!
That's great!

179
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,620
What's so great, you fool?!

180
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,960
I guess they dropped all the losers of
the competition in here.

181
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,340
What?!

182
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,910
What do you mean by that?!
How can I get out of here?!

183
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,570
There's no way out!
We must've got set up by Doflamingo!

184
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,250
This means war, Elizabello-sama!

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,490
I can't believe it but, even with my King Punch,
I can't break this wall.

186
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,730
Whoa-whoa, we're underground.
That means the wall is the ground itself.

187
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,630
No matter how strong your punch is,
it's impossible to break it.

188
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,470
What are they gonna do
collecting us here?

189
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,840
I don't think they're gonna treat us here.

190
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,200
If this turns out badly, Doflamingo,

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,420
I'll carry this anger
even towards your grandchildren!

192
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,260
Listen to this rousing cheer!

193
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,190
Now, the potential winner of Block D...

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,540
...Rolling Logan sets his sights on Rebecca!

195
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,840
Let's see!
Which bone should I break?

196
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,800
Should I break her neck?

197
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,350
Neck!

198
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,650
Or spine?

199
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,950
Spine!

200
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,300
Or...

201
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,760
...arms and legs sound better?

202
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,860
Much better!

203
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,000
You guys are too sweet.
This Ill Weed-chan deserves...

204
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,320
...her whole body smashed up!
Don't you think so?!

205
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,590
It's so irritating!
What's wrong with them?!

206
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,820
Like I told you, that's how much they hate the former king.

207
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,350
But it has nothing to do with her!
She's a great person!

208
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,450
We all know that.

209
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,870
When I got seriously injured
and my life was hanging in the balance,

210
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,960
Rebecca sat up with me
and kept encouraging me.

211
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,560
Not just me!
Everybody here likes her!

212
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,570
But the people outside will never forget...

213
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,320
...what happened that night.

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,990
That night?

215
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,580
Yeah, it's a long story but...

216
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,660
Never mind then.

217
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,710
What?!

218
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,980
Go for it, Rebecca!

219
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,840
All right. Should we start?

220
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,430
Rolling Logan has started attacking
with the momentum from the crowds!

221
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,050
Using his long reach,
he's going for Rebecca from both sides!

222
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,390
They say his max grip strength is over 500 kg! Rolling Logan!

223
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,940
Once she gets caught, it's all over for her!

224
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,650
This is not good!

225
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,750
It's no use!

226
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:41,650
He calmly tracks her down
and narrows the space for her to run!

227
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,620
She's literally like a frog
in the sights of a snake!

228
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,540
What is she gonna do now?! Rebecca!

229
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,820
Your back is wide-open!

230
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,820
Both of you, go to hell!

231
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,130
How cowardly are you to
try to attack me from the back?!

232
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Do you want me to break your bones?!

233
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,830
Watch this carefully, Ill Weed-chan!

234
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,440
Now's the chance!

235
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,610
Oh? Taking advantage of him being off-guard,
Rebecca started to run!

236
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,890
Rebecca is scurrying like a rat!

237
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,690
Rolling Logan is chasing her...

238
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,150
...mowing down the other contenders!

239
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,370
Stop running, Rebecca! Fight!

240
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,970
Fight and bleed!

241
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,100
Oh no!

242
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,640
I'll never let anyone get away
once I've got them in my sights!

243
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,420
Rebecca lost her precious sword!
She's totally cornered!

244
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,170
Rebecca finally got caught!

245
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,240
Now, Rolling Logan!

246
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,790
What is he going to do from that position?!

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,060
Ill Weed-chan!
What do you want me to do?!

248
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,420
Do you want me to throw you to the ground?
Or...

249
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,340
...like the guy earlier...

250
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,520
I like the way you scream!

251
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,170
I'll do this then!

252
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,700
I'm gonna pulverize you slowly
so let me hear it more!

253
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,120
That bastard!

254
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,790
--This is it for her!
--Rebecca!

255
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,810
Would the undefeated girl
lose here finally?!

256
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,960
Pulverize! Pulverize! Pulverize!

257
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,870
Pulverize! Pulverize! Pulverize! Pulverize!

258
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,340
Soldier-san... I...

259
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,440
Faster!
Use the lower half of your body!

260
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,020
I can't take it anymore!

261
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,320
Today's competition is a chance and I'll take it!

262
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,190
You're out of your mind!
It's not a chance!

263
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,640
It's impossible for you
to win that competition!

264
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,830
You're gonna die!
I won't allow you to enter it!

265
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,950
Let go of Rebecca!

266
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh, the smiling gladiator Agilia joins
in this fight!

267
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,840
She saved Rebecca with a merciful smile!

268
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,180
She got away thanks to Agilia!

269
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,320
Way to go, happy-faced old woman!

270
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
"Happy-faced old woman," you said?

271
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,780
Are you okay, Rebecca?

272
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,690
I'm okay! Thank you, Agilia-san!

273
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,230
It's too soon to say that!

274
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,230
You want to win the Flare-Flare Fruit, don't you?

275
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,860
Then, have courage to fight!

276
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,210
How dare you!

277
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,110
I'm gonna finish both of you off
and send you straight to hell!

278
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,980
This competition is nothing
like the other events!

279
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,870
You can't win this thing
just by running around!

280
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,990
Agilia-san!

281
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,410
Angry Rolling Logan is overpowering Agilia!

282
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,160
Agilia-san!

283
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,820
Agilia-san, bend over!

284
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,920
Let me step on your back!

285
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,070
Oh! No way! Rebecca is going to make an attack?!

286
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,840
It's not gonna work against me!

287
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,100
What?!

288
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,730
No! This can't be true!

289
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,610
I can't believe it!
Rebecca won an upset victory!

290
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,560
She moved unbelievably fast
and fended off Rolling Logan's attack

291
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,860
forcing him to fall out of the ring!

292
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,790
You made him believe that you were gonna attack,

293
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,390
drew his attack, and took advantage of it.

294
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,610
You're unbelievable.

295
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,530
Prepare to die!

296
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,560
Now you're facing the moment of truth!

297
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,170
You gotta move to the finals at any cost!

298
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,860
Uh-huh!

299
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,640
She did it!

300
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,660
All right! Rebecca! Agilia!

301
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,230
Another one's coming!
Kick his ass, Rebecca!

302
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,100
Hey, not Cabbage!
Show me Rebecca!

303
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,340
Yeah, we want Rebecca!

304
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,260
I just realized it's hard to watch it from here.

305
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,580
I'm gonna go closer to cheer for her!

306
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,220
Oh yeah. It seemed to me like everybody was happy in this country but...

307
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,250
...by seeing you guys,
I noticed it's not true.

308
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,510
What you saw was the bright side
where "winners" are living happily.

309
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,620
Doflamingo labels...

310
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,490
...the people who obey him "winners"
and the people who disobey him "losers."

311
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,040
Just like the World Government!

312
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,580
Rogue "Losers" are like trash

313
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,770
and once you hide that trash somewhere dark,

314
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,370
the country looks good, but only on the surface.

315
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,910
Let's go treasure hunting!

316
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,870
It's similar to the country I grew up in.

317
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,740
Once you start feeling something's wrong,

318
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,510
you'll see there are so many strange things going on here.

319
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,140
We think there is an even darker part.

320
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,840
You better be careful, too.

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,550
Okay! Bye!

322
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,520
Where did Luffy-senpai go?
I can't find him anywhere!

323
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,290
I can't face Zoro-senpai like this.

324
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,770
L-L-L-L....

325
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,460
Luffy-senpai!
