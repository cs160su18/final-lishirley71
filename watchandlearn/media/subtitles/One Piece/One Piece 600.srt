2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,850
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,150
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

11
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,690
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

12
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,650
After forming an alliance--
with Trafalgar Law,

13
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,640
Luffy finally encountered Caesar Clown

14
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,140
aka the Master who rules
the island. However...

15
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,620
You shouldn't underestimate me.

16
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,350
You're a Warlord-sama now, aren't you?

17
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,000
You've done so well.

18
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,600
When did you come here?

19
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,600
Vergo!

20
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,210
It's inevitable. This is
Joker's important territory.

21
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,420
I can't just let those who learn
about his identity walk away.

22
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,570
Hey, Tra-guy, who's Joker?

23
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,380
He is a member of the Seven Warlords
authorized by the World Government.

24
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,660
He is Don Quixote Doflamingo.

25
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,100
"Save the Children! The
Master's Evil Hands Close in!"

26
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,530
Doflamingo...

27
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,740
Who is that?

28
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,370
Didn't you see him at the Navy Headquarters?

29
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,150
At the Navy Headquarters?

30
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,250
Oh yeah!

31
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,500
Hey, you, gator guy!

32
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,970
You turned me down and now, you
wanna team up with Whitebeard?

33
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,680
It makes me jealous.

34
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,870
That bird guy!

35
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,480
You better not take him lightly.

36
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,110
He's right.

37
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,460
And they say that Doflamingo

38
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,420
attacked Moria after the War of the Best!

39
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,450
He attacked Moria?

40
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,670
THE REMAINS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
LABORATORY NAMI AND USOPP'S GROUP

41
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,800
Master!

42
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,190
Master!

43
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Master!

44
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,690
So...

45
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,520
...you're the one who
kidnapped these children?!

46
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,590
Why is he here?

47
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,700
Luffy and the others couldn't meet him?

48
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,760
How could you do such a horrible thing?

49
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,420
Horrible?

50
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,160
Why did you take them away?
The children are suffering!

51
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,340
What?!

52
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,400
Hey, no! Don't, Nami!

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,770
You're making them suffer!

54
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,210
Whoa-whoa,

55
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,190
Law said he's a Logia-type Devil Fruit
eater with a 300 million berry bounty!

56
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,130
What did you give to such small children?!

57
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,370
They said they want to go home!

58
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm sure their parents are looking for them!

59
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,020
We will get them out of here at any cost!

60
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,090
Where are the children who wanna go home?

61
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,590
Master!

62
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,760
Hey!

63
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,220
--Master!
--Hey, wait!

64
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,440
Don't go! Do you wanna go back to the lab?!

65
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,990
Get out of my way!

66
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,480
Usopp!

67
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,610
Candy...

68
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,710
What?

69
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,420
Master, give me the candy!

70
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,650
That's it. Come back to me, children.

71
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,480
Wait, you all!

72
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,020
You shouldn't go back to him!

73
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't you wanna go home?!

74
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,280
Don't touch me!

75
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,450
Cockroach!

76
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,000
Go away, cockroach!

77
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,970
Nami!

78
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,720
--You alright?!
--Y-Yeah.

79
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,470
You brat, don't push your luck!

80
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,640
No, Usopp!

81
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,960
Let go of me!

82
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,020
We have no choice but to stop them by force!

83
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,250
He must be hallucinating!
He called you a "cockroach"!

84
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,060
But...

85
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,010
They're victims!

86
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,470
It's not their fault!

87
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,870
Unchain me!

88
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,710
It's painful!

89
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,920
But we have to do something
before they beat us!

90
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,510
Focus that anger at...

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,310
...that jerk!

92
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,890
Take these off!

93
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,640
Unchain me!

94
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,040
--No way!
--They broke the chains?!

95
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,670
Amazing!

96
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,470
You became so powerful!

97
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,930
That bastard!

98
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,970
Candy...

99
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,600
Master...

100
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,000
Candy...

101
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,150
--Master...
--Give me...

102
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,270
That gas bastard! I'll show him!

103
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,340
This should work against gas!

104
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,700
Special Attack!

105
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,410
Fire Bird Star!

106
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,660
Kids, move aside!

107
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,130
What?!

108
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,600
Did you think I would catch fire and explode?

109
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,020
You knew my powers are gas-based, didn't you?

110
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,140
But it's too bad. I put the fire
out before it even touched me.

111
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,990
Poison gas is not the only
kind of gas, you see.

112
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,870
The air all around us is gas, too!

113
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,200
Which means I can manipulate
the air within a certain area.

114
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,250
--He can manipulate...
--...The air?

115
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,160
If I remove the oxygen, fire can't burn.

116
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,840
And you people can't even breathe!

117
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,650
Master?

118
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,690
Like this!

119
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,000
Usopp!

120
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,830
Black Ball!

121
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,790
Storm Cloud...

122
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,180
Master...

123
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,020
C-Candy...

124
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,240
Candy...

125
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,880
Hurry...

126
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,450
Were you wondering if
Straw Hat didn't meet me?

127
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,330
Well, he did.

128
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,290
Straw Hat and two others.

129
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,550
I made them suffocate!

130
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Hey!

131
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,080
Candy!

132
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,260
--Master! Candy!
--Candy... Candy... Candy...

133
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,890
--Candy! Candy!
--Hurry!

134
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,440
--Master!
--Candy!

135
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,070
Give me it! Give me it!

136
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,410
Children.

137
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,010
I'm only giving it to the good
children who go back to the lab!

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,960
Good children only?

139
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,040
That's right!

140
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,020
Yes, yes! I'll be good!

141
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,380
Then just wait a little bit longer, can you?

142
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,670
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

143
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,390
Let's go back! Master!

144
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,560
Okay, okay! Well, before we do...

145
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,160
Kill these devils who took you away

146
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,340
and tried to worsen your pain!

147
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,190
Kill them...

148
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,890
Crush their skulls with that giant pipe!

149
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,760
Uh-huh...

150
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,340
Don't...

151
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,680
I can't think clearly...

152
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,770
Caesar!

153
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,660
--Browncolor?!
--No, Brownbeard!

154
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,330
Straw Hats!

155
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,410
I came to my senses!

156
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,450
I don't remember this one.

157
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,780
Oh yes! You're my dutiful
lackey - Brownbeard!

158
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,910
You bastard! Did you even forget who I was?!

159
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,690
Of course not!

160
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,670
What happened to you?

161
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,360
Your whole body is charred
and you look terrible.

162
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,130
That's because you ordered them to kill me!

163
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,420
I remember now!

164
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,380
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

165
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,180
Your name is also on our kill list.

166
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,230
He was easy to manipulate because
he was so dumb but he's a pain now.

167
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,310
I don't need him.--

168
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,950
Kill him.

169
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,400
The Cool Brothers, huh?

170
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,660
That's how you got charred.

171
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,830
I trusted you.

172
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,250
Don't be so angry.

173
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,090
You're still alive after getting
attacked by the Cool Brothers.

174
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,630
You're very lucky!

175
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,170
Shut up!

176
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,240
Caesar!

177
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,040
Hey, children, it's dangerous here!

178
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,520
Get on board the Flying Gas Balloon outside.

179
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,110
Let's get away from here!

180
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,910
Wait, everybody! Don't go!

181
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,540
Caesar!

182
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,250
I don't care that you fooled me.

183
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,050
I don't care about myself anymore.

184
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,050
But I want my crew back!

185
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,140
I'm not gonna let them go
through hell like I did!

186
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,190
Idiot! You don't have a crew anymore!

187
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,820
You and all of your crew
became my subordinates!

188
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,530
Stop acting like a captain!

189
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,410
You're just a shitty pirate who
got beaten in the New World!

190
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,830
Hey, Nami! Let's go after the kids!

191
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,490
Okay!

192
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,840
They will keep following me
thinking I'm their savior!

193
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,100
They're too dumb to notice.

194
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,340
They don't know that I kept them
alive because they're my guinea pigs!

195
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,100
You bastard!

196
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,110
Gastanet!

197
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,470
--Brownbeard!
--What happened?!

198
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,960
Gastanet!

199
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,310
PUNK HAZARD - THE MIDDLE LAKE

200
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,740
They're so persistent!

201
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,890
How far is the lab?

202
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,280
The one that was on the other side
made it completely to this side now!

203
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,240
Which means this one is the
last piece of him, doesn't it?

204
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,330
It merged with a smaller one?

205
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,000
It's getting bigger and bigger!

206
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,340
Just keep running to the lab!

207
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,880
Wait for me!

208
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,220
Momonosuke!

209
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,320
--Open it!
--Give us back Captain-chan!

210
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
Give us back Smo-yan!

211
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,390
CAESAR CLOWN'S LABORATORY - THE FRONT

212
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,250
It's starting to move!

213
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,970
They're all heading in the same direction.

214
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,560
Where are they going?

215
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,040
CAESAR'S RESEARCH ROOM

216
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,940
I found out the formula of the
drug and I found sedatives.

217
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,270
Now I have to find a way to
rescue-- Luffy and the others.

218
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,810
Easy...--

219
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,380
Easy...--

220
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,480
Wh-Who was that?

221
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,670
Can I have the candy?

222
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,540
Where did the Master go?

223
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,280
Master...

224
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,960
Hey, Master!

225
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,560
Where are you?

226
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,650
This is Caesar. Are you there, Monet?

227
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,340
Yes.

228
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,020
I retrieved the children safely.

229
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,810
Is Smiley's food ready?

230
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,920
Everything you ordered me
to do is prepared, Master.

231
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
The Navy soldiers are in
front of the closed shutters.

232
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,700
And we can transfer the Straw Hats anytime.

233
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,370
The Video Transponder Snails
are on standby outside.

234
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,840
So, when Smiley gets there,

235
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,060
we can start broadcasting the fun experiment?

236
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,040
Yes.

237
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,290
Great. Connect me to all the receivers.

238
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,260
Okay.

239
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,660
To all unlawful "brokers" wherever you are.

240
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,610
I'm sorry to contact you on such short notice

241
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,190
but you all are very lucky to see this!

242
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,070
What you're about to witness is the
deployment of a poison gas weapon.

243
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,530
I added a new feature to the
one from four years ago.

244
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,030
It's something those scum from the
Government-- can only dream of creating.

245
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,200
Today, we have uninvited
guests here on our island.

246
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,600
That's why I decided to
perform the experiment.

247
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,950
Invasion, war, domination.--

248
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,260
It has various uses.

249
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,770
If it appeals to you,

250
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,190
let's talk business.

251
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,190
Give us back Captain-chan!

252
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,990
Are you interested in a
weapon of mass destruction?

253
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,660
No.

254
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,920
But...

255
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,740
...I'd lose nothing by
learning about it, right?

256
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,780
An agreement has been made between Law and Caesar.

257
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,720
As that secret comes to light...

258
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,490
...Zoro and gang, fleeing from Smiley, come upon a large object.

259
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,730
It is nothing less than an indication of the beginning of Caesar's fearsome plan!

260
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

261
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,620
"Shaking Up the New World!
Caesar's Horrendous Experiment!"

262
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
