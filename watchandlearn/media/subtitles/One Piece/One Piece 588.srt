00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,160
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,290
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,460
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,880
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,340
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,510
Find it!

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,850
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,600
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,770

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,010
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,940
It's not our way to worry

Since the day that the dream began

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,700
the future that I’m aiming at hasn’t changed

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,470
we go!

68
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,470
WE GO!

69
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,150
...head for the New World,

71
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,690
the second half of the Grand Line.

72
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

74
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

75
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,340
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

79
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,100
After surviving a fierce battle,

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,360
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,820
the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,110
After receiving an emergency signal,
they landed on Punk Hazard Island.

83
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,320
It was a strange island
divided into two parts;

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,030
the Burning Lands and the Ice Lands.

85
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,500
Whether it's the Straw Hats or Smoker,

86
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,500
we can get rid of all those troublemakers

87
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,460
who are learning what's
going on on this island at once!

88
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,920
Call Joker.

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,420
Yes, sir!

90
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,140
I never understood why you joined
the Warlords in the first place!

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
What are you up to?

92
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,070
There are things that you can't see

93
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,610
unless you change your standing, Smoker!

94
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,570
Scalpel!

95
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,710
My heart!

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,220
I don't have to tell you anything.

97
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:11,120
"Meeting Again After Two Years!
Luffy and Law!"

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,650
No!

99
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,150
Tashigi-chan!
He's way too strong!

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,440
Let go of me!

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,240
I didn't join the Navy
to cower behind rocks!

102
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,820
You will get chopped up again in that film!

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,700
Leave it up to Smo-yan for now!

104
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,580
Oh? The film is gone!

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,250
Now is our chance!

106
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,710
Go, Alliga-taur!

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,840
What is that?

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,350
A ship?

109
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,060
Isn't it a warship?

110
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,190
So the Navy's here?

111
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,230
What? I didn't see anything
around here little while ago.

112
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,070
What's going on?
Is the Master okay?

113
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,610
Hey, somebody is there!

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,860
Oh? It's...

115
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,530
Hey! Hey!

116
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,750
It's you! Do you remember me?

117
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,160
Thank you for your help the other day!

118
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Straw Hat-ya.

119
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,290
He's...

120
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,630
...the guy we met at the
Human Shoppe in Sabaody.

121
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,800
His name is Trafalgar Law.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
He is now...

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,890
Yes, he's Traf... Tra-guy!

124
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,100
Yeah, that's his name!

125
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,850
He helped me get away from the battlefield

126
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,770
and treated my wounds!

127
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,690
Your wounds?

128
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,900
Yeah!

129
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,650
Like Jimbei, he saved my life!

130
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,400
Hey!

131
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,490
I didn't expect to see you here!

132
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,620
Thank you very much for helping me!

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,910
Oh?

134
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,750
Where are the talking bear and the others?

135
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,550
Put Straw Hat-ya on my ship!

136
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm gonna help him get out of here.

137
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,840
Let me take care of him for now!

138
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm a doctor!

139
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,180
Where's Ace?!

140
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,390
What is going to happen
if we leave him like that?

141
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,770
Well, it's simple.

142
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,320
Like I said when we got here,

143
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,570
if his wound opens up, he will die.

144
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,410
Straw Hat-ya must take a
complete rest for two more weeks.

145
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,280
All right. Thank you for everything.

146
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,000
So you made it, Straw Hat-ya.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,420
But you don't have to thank me for that.

148
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,300
I just did it on the spur of the moment.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,010
We are both pirates.

150
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't forget that.

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Yeah.

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,390
We're all enemies when it comes
to the fight for the One Piece

153
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,940
but I owe so many people for
helping me two years ago.

154
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,810
I just saw Jimbei and now you - I'm so lucky!

155
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,860
Thanks again!

156
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
Hey, there is a Navy soldier on the ground!

157
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,330
Is it...

158
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,410
Could it be...

159
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,460
Hey, help me, Trafalgar.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Smoker-san!

161
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:53,970
No!

162
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,590
Smoker-san!

163
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,430
Smo-yan!

164
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,350
The Navy?!

165
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,680
Oh? Is she...

166
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,060
Oh no, Luffy!
The Navy's here!

167
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,690
Yeah!

168
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,240
Captain-chan, what happened?!

169
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,490
You alright, Smo-yan?

170
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,370
Smoker-san!!

171
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
I thought so! It's Smokey and his clan!

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,540
It's been a while!

173
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,340
There is a hole in his chest!

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,010
Smoker-san!

175
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,470
To become a member of the Warlords...

176
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,020
...he delivered the hearts
of one hundred pirates

177
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,730
to the headquarters!

178
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,310
He's crazy!

179
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,990
How dare you!

180
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,080
How dare you!

181
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,450
How dare you!

182
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,460
How dare you!!

183
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,590
Whoa whoa, don't.

184
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,630
I don't like these lame
tearjerking scenes.

185
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Room.

186
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,190
Tashigi-chan!

187
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,900
Shambles!

188
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,610
Damn! He took her down again!

189
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,820
Smo-san's on the ground, too!

190
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,790
What did he just do?

191
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,370
She never learns.

192
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,380
Don't get so serious.

193
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Tashigi-chan!

194
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,960
Luffy! Let's go!
It's dangerous here!

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,970
Uh-huh.

196
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,430
Oh yeah.

197
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,140
Hey, Tra-guy, I wanna ask you something.

198
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,720
Go round to the back of the laboratory.

199
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,940
What you're looking for is there.

200
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,600
We'll see each other again later.

201
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,480
We both have something we want to take back.

202
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,990
Good. He was talking about me.

203
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,910
I shouldn't be here.
I'm a former pirate!

204
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,580
Alright, Luffy, let's get away from the Navy!

205
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,720
I wonder if Smokey and his clan will be okay.

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
Did they lose to Tra-guy?

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,220
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

208
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,430
Shoot!

209
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,850
Stop! This is no time for that!

210
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,480
Smo-san and Captain-chan are injured!

211
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,330
It's freezing!

212
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,120
A MOUNTAIN BEHIND THE LABORATORY
SANJI'S GROUP

213
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,000
What should we do?!

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,120
The kids can't take it anymore.

215
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,710
Alright, let's remove this fur and...

216
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,670
No! It's my body!

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,300
But I don't think we can find
any warm coats around here...

218
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,050
Isn't there a lodge or something?

219
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,470
On top of that,

220
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,890
I need a camera and a mirror -
and a sh-shower would be nice!

221
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,980
Shut up or I'll tie you up!

222
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,850
Who's who?

223
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,060
The robot is scary...

224
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,610
Since it's come to this, you people,

225
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,110
I need you to put a leaf on your head.

226
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,660
Huh? What are you talking about?!

227
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,070
The kids are collapsing from cold!

228
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,660
And I don't see any plants on this island!

229
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,950
So there are no leaves!

230
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,630
Then a stone or whatever is fine! Hurry up!

231
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,380
If you insist.

232
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,670
I hope you have a plan.

233
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,510
I'll get them for the kids!

234
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,600
We got it. Now what?

235
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,980
If it's a spell-to-make-it-not-cold
kind of bullshit, I'll kick your ass!

236
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,070
All right!

237
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,990
Poof!

238
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,540
What?!

239
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,040
What's this?!

240
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
I got a coat and boots!

241
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,220
Why?! How did you do it?!

242
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,640
Gloves!

243
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,350
It's warm!

244
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,390
Very warm!

245
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,730
The thing is I ate an unusual fruit one day

246
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,440
and since then, I can use magic
which allows me to disguise myself

247
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,860
or everyone else in any way I please.

248
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,240
I don't know much about foreign
clothes but will these suffice?

249
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,240
I have to warn you.

250
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,950
Since it's magic, if you take those
clothes off, they'll disappear.

251
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,250
Cool! Head man! Thank you!

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,380
He shouldn't have done it!

253
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,710
So he's a Devil Fruit eater?

254
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,130
What? Devil?

255
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,300
But, wait a minute.

256
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,010
If you had such power,

257
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,560
why didn't you do it sooner?!

258
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,440
I-It was nice to see her in a breast-band.

259
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,480
I didn't wanna cover it up.

260
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,980
You fool!

261
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,530
I-It itches! Itchy!

262
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,290
You'll never say "ouch" or "I'm cold," will you?

263
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,290
I'm a warrior!

264
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,960
There you are! Guys!

265
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,510
Hey!

266
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,780
Hey! Hey!

267
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,570
Why are they here?

268
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,200
Are you all okay?

269
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,740
Oh, it's them!

270
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,290
Luffy and the others!

271
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,330
Zoro! Usopp! Robin! Brook!

272
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,670
I'm glad to see you!

273
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,250
Why is that jackass cook jumping around?

274
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,760
He went nuts from cold?

275
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,010
Oh? They look like giant children to me.

276
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,430
Shh...

277
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,350
Huh? Hey, what are you doing?!

278
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,650
Don't do it, Franky!

279
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,940
Hello...

280
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,410
THE STRAW HATS' ENCAMPMENT

281
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,990
We're here! This is good.

282
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,370
This building has a similar style as the other one.

283
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,830
But it's crumbling.

284
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,210
It looks like there was a
huge explosion or something.

285
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,920
It's fine as long as it'll
shelter us from the blizzard.

286
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,720
Now, where should we begin?

287
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,470
I hurt my own delicate body!

288
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,760
I'll treat it right away!

289
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,020
Hey, Sanji-kun!
What are you doing to my body?!

290
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,310
I'm Chopper.

291
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,990
I got my legs back!

292
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,950
Leg-maro! Oh my hind legs!

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,750
I told you there is no creature like that!

294
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,880
How surreal.

295
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,220
He's quite original.

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,800
Th-The skeleton...

297
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,720
...Just talked!

298
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,810
Are you okay, Nami-Sanji?

299
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,440
It was weird.

300
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,110
I had a dream of crossing a river.

301
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,530
There was a river running
through giant boobs...

302
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,490
It's not the time for that!

303
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
Hey, do the tank thing!

304
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,210
Show us the laser beam!

305
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,710
Shut up!

306
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,340
Who was it in his body?

307
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,010
Huh? You sure?

308
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,890
You want to smoke, don't you?

309
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,730
Let's talk like adults, everybody.

310
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,860
Alright. Now, who is who?

311
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm Franky!

312
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,030
Don't come to me when you get wounded.

313
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm Chopper.

314
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,080
I'll treat your wounds.

315
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,580
I'm Nami.

316
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,910
I will never shoot the laser beam!

317
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,210
And this is our...

318
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,920
...Nami-san!

319
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,220
Yeah! There you are!

320
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,890
Was I always that indecent?!

321
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,560
I won't do it again!

322
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,350
Don't hurt Nami-san anymore!

323
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,520
Don't, Nami!

324
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,810
Nami's gonna die!

325
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,900
If you touch my body,
I'll make you pay 200,000 berries.

326
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,230
Peeping will be 100,000.

327
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,440
That's so cruel!

328
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,280
Stop laughing!

329
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,990
Wouldn't be so funny if it happened to you!

330
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,660
Let's get it straight from the beginning.

331
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,620
He is the samurai from the Wano Kingdom.

332
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,250
The signal that we received was...

333
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,800
...meant for the Alliga-taur

334
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,050
who they call "Boss" from one of his men.

335
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,970
It all started when this samurai
sliced up all those centaurs.

336
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,480
But I just wanted to rescue my missing
son - Momonosuke and cut those people

337
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,810
because they were standing in my way!

338
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,730
In fact, look!

339
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,320
That many children were
held captive in the facility.

340
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,530
I'm sure Momonosuke is still there!

341
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,280
Uh-huh, there were more children.

342
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,830
We don't even know the
newcomers that well yet.

343
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,000
But the question is what
happened after the signal.

344
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,960
It's that man we just saw!

345
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,260
People were saying that he is a Warlord.

346
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,640
What?!

347
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,930
You mean Tra-guy?!

348
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,640
Did he become a Warlord?!

349
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,270
Yes, he joined them within past two years.

350
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,650
He chopped me up into three
pieces before I knew it!

351
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,490
My head was kept in the facility!

352
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,950
My torso was left there.

353
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,740
And my legs were chased by a beast.

354
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,040
When my legs were trying to
get away using their wits,

355
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
they stuck onto something.

356
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,250
And that was the back of the dragon's head!

357
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,170
Oh yeah, you were cursing about a Warlord!

358
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,550
What? There were just legs, weren't there?

359
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,180
How did he speak?

360
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,470
Oh? You're right.

361
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,010
Oh, that was...

362
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,680
...my farts.

363
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,400
It has always been my specialty.

364
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,150
So you were fart-talking?! Yuck!

365
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,020
Yes, I was!

366
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,440
Oh, it smells when we're in a room.

367
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,820
How funny to see a person
with just a head and legs.

368
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,830
By contrast, I just saw
someone with just a torso.

369
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,420
That was his torso, obviously.

370
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
You're right!

371
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,080
You saw it?!

372
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,210
Where?!

373
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,880
Where did you see my torso?!

374
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,310
Um... Are you... Tashigi-chan?

375
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,320
Y-Yes.

376
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,530
What?! So you're really Tashigi-chan!

377
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,570
They got switched?!

378
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,530
What's going on?!
How did this happen?!

379
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,200
I mean, are you okay without
a heart, Tashigi-chan?

380
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,910
Yes, strangely.

381
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,420
It's hard to talk to Captain-chan...

382
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,630
That means...

383
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,960
This one is so scary!

384
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
Smo-yan with Tashigi-chan's body!

385
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,350
It says "CC" on a ship hidden
beside the laboratory.

386
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,180
What? There was such a ship,
Vice Admiral Smoker?

387
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,230
Yeah. If it's left over from old days,

388
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,520
the mark should be "PH"...

389
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,030
...standing for Punk Hazard.

390
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,820
If there is some mastermind behind Law

391
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,580
and if "CC" are his initials,

392
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,330
I think I know who it is.

393
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,580
If he's here on this island,

394
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,380
it makes a lot of senses!

395
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,850
He is the former colleague of Dr.Vegapunk.

396
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,600
He is a scientist

397
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,940
named Caesar Clown!

398
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,240
What the hell have you done, Law?!

399
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,950
I'm the one who should be complaining here!

400
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,910
Caesar!

401
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,840
In the tumultuous New World, the ruler of Punk Hazard...

402
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,470
...turns out to be an unexpectedly well-respected figure.

403
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,350
As the Straw Hats recoil from this shocking fact...

404
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,640
...Smoker tries to discover the true identity of this mysterious master.

405
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

406
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,360
"The Worst in the World!
A Scientist of Terror - Caesar!"

407
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
