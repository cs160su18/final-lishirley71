2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,380
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,630
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,420
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,360
So where do you guys wanna go?

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Since we've got our own ship,
we won't take the train.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,320
We'll just follow the log.

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,870
I see. Then it must be Water Seven.

27
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,490
Water Seven?

28
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,670
Above all, it's a city that made
a name for itself with its shipyard.

29
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,580
Their technology is No. 1 in the world!

30
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,960
All right! I've decided!

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,920
We're gonna go there and get a
shipwright to join our crew for sure!

32
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,850
What the hell is this?!

33
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,810
This area should be okay, don't you think?

34
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,360
Holy crap! The Going Merry
has gotten this rickety?

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,980
Take this with you.

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,190
A map?

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,360
This'll be helpful! Thanks!

38
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,910
That's perfect. Once we get the money,
we can go to the shipyard right away.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,740
Yeah. We can finally have
the Going Merry repaired!

40
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,660
All right! Go! Yagara!

41
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,880
Thanks for your business! Be careful!

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,340
Dash to the shipyard!

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,800
Yahoo!

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:33,850
"Adventure in the City on the Water!
Head to the Mammoth Shipbuilding Plant"

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,190
This is great!

46
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,400
Hey! I'm counting on you!

47
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,990
It's amazing that such a convenient
creature exists in this world.

48
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,120
It doesn't rock much. It's comfortable!

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,620
To the right! Right!

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,420
--The ball is headed your way!
--Here we go!

51
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,590
Ah! Stop the ball!

52
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,470
--Pass the ball! Pass the ball!
--This is neato!

53
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,440
This area seems to be a residential area.

54
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,400
This town really is built around canals.

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,570
Hey, mister!

56
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,740
Hey, pops!

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,700
Where are you going? Sightseeing?

58
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,580
To the shipyard! We're gonna
have our ship repaired!

59
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,330
Then go to the backstreet
shopping district first!

60
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,290
Checkmate.

61
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,040
Thanks!

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,210
S-Sure...

63
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,210
Backstreet shopping district...

64
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,920
We'll turn right ahead of here.

65
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,930
Oh, my beautiful mademoiselle!
How about dinner with me tonight?

66
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,390
Huh?

67
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,350
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

68
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,770
Don't worry about him. The guys
around here say that like it's a greeting.

69
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,280
O-Okay.

70
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,070
Hey! Hurry up and go to work already!

71
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,580
I know, I know. Stop nagging.

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,120
At any rate, people in this
town are generous to outsiders--

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,870
or should I say they're overly friendly?

74
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,210
Hey! You with the long nose!

75
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,670
--Huh?
--Nothing. I was just saying hey, that's all.

76
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,630
Want a fist in your face, pops?!

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,600
Hm?

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,020
Ah, a hill is coming up. We're gonna
go against the flow. Is that okay?

79
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,560
Can we go up?

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,610
Wait! Wrong way! Go right! Right!

81
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,660
So it doesn't matter even if the
water is running downhill, huh?

82
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,080
Not bad, you guys!

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,120
The canals even go above the rooftops!

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,000
But we're going the wrong way!
We have to go to the shopping district first!

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,550
Oh, don't be so hasty.

86
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,630
This is a rare opportunity.
Let's stroll through the canals.

87
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,970
--Hm?
--Hm?

88
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,430
H-Hey! L-Look! Look ahead!

89
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,970
Oh, that's right! We're at the top of the hill!

90
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,940
Which means...

91
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,990
This is fun!

92
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,320
This is fun but scary!

93
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,950
Nooo!

94
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,840
Sorry!

95
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,930
Arrrrgh! We went flying!

96
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,430
We're falling. We're falling.
We're falling. We're falling.

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,850
We're falling. We're falling. We're falling...

98
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,690
We're falling!

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't get full of yourself!

100
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,580
Hm?

101
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,920
Miss! Our stuff is cheap!

102
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,500
How about taking a look at our products?

103
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,510
We've got lots of superb
items that are hard to find!

104
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,430
We're now starting our 50%-off sale!

105
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,060
Wow! Things have gotten lively!

106
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,440
Oh? We ended up in the shopping district!

107
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,650
Could it be that you took a shortcut?

108
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,200
I'm sorry. You guys are actually smart, huh?

109
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,250
I've never been to such an
energetic shopping district!

110
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,460
Hey, look at that! That's a huge bull!

111
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,090
Whoa! Hey, it's coming this way!

112
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,720
This guy is scary!

113
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
It's like he's about to eat us!

114
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,350
Considering its size, I wonder if this is a King.

115
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,940
Hm? What the heck is that?

116
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,310
Masks...

117
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,730
Wow, they're pretty. They're gorgeous.

118
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,360
I wonder if there's a party or something.

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,820
What? What's going on?

120
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,330
Here! These are freshly made
water-water octopus dumplings!

121
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,790
Two water-water croquettes?

122
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,830
Both look yummy! Yagara, go over there.

123
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,130
Hey, where're you going?!

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Hey, Luffy! Where're you going?!

125
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,050
Ask the Yagara!

126
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,600
Welcome! What would you like?

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Oh, so you were hungry.

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,980
Water-water meat is the Yagara's
favorite food, although it's human food.

129
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,280
Water-water? Then give me ten of them.

130
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,820
They're so good that the cooks from the gourmet
town would secretly come to purchase them.

131
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,580
It captivates your body and soul, doesn't it?

132
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,040
They... are... so... soft...!

133
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,130
--Yummy!
--What?! Is it that good?

134
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,960
Hey, Luffy! Give me one!

135
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,920
No! Buy it yourself!

136
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,970
Hm?

137
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,640
Hey, Nami! Pull the boat over to that shop!

138
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,060
More masks... Now that I look closer,
they seem to be everywhere in town.

139
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,930
Nami!

140
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,940
Those people with masks...

141
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,610
Hey, Nami!

142
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,490
Hey! Some pirates started
causing a ruckus at Dock #1!

143
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,030
What?! Is that true?!

144
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,740
We'd better get there right away!

145
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,290
I don't understand what you're saying.

146
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,910
Well, actually...

147
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,460
I thought about it carefully.

148
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,720
I thought about it really carefully.

149
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,680
Well, it's true that you guys repaired our ship,

150
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,140
but no matter how I looked at it,
I thought the fee was too high.

151
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,520
You're interrupting our work.

152
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,610
So... I decided not to pay--
not even a single Berry.

153
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,530
Thanks for the perfect repairs!

154
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,450
On top of that, it was free!

155
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,960
Well... Kalifa, what's going on over there?

156
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Yes, Iceberg-san.
They're the customers for Dock #1.

157
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,300
Now that the work has been completed,
they're saying they won't pay.

158
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,970
That's sexual harassment.

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,720
Well... That is sexual harassment.

160
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,830
Sir, it'd be wise not to tease craftsmen like that.

161
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,090
B-Boss!

162
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,050
Boss!

163
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,010
Oh, pardon me.

164
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,640
You son of a bitch!
Watch carefully where you're going!

165
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,020
Oh, pardon me.

166
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,980
Y-You bastards! Are you picking a fight?!
Who do you think we are?!

167
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,410
Hey, have you test fired the cannon?

168
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,120
Oh, not yet, sir.

169
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,050
Dammit! Who the hell are you guys?!

170
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,420
We'll remember this!

171
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,980
The pirate way of doing things doesn't
work on craftsmen's turf, now, does it?

172
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,090
Now... We're finally going to
go to the shipbuilding island

173
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,430
by using a water gate elevator.

174
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,930
A water gate elevator?

175
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,850
That tower-like thing is the one.

176
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,860
Please come in!

177
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,360
The elevator will go to the shipbuilding island,

178
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,830
shipbuilding plant, and downtown Water Seven!

179
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,500
Please hurry inside the gate!

180
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,750
One minute until the gate gets closed!

181
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,720
What'll happen inside?

182
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,930
Whoa! The water gate is now closed!

183
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,600
We're going up!
We're going up! We're going up!

184
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,530
I see. That happens. Then, this happens.

185
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,610
And then, they do this and that.
So that's why it's a water gate elevator.

186
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,580
Whoa! Water Seven is interesting!

187
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,960
So they use water for all sorts of things!

188
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,170
Hey!

189
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,470
Who're you calling Moss Head?

190
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,430
Hey, Zoro.

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,720
--Huh?
--Where's Robin-chan? She isn't on the ship.

192
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,350
Hm?

193
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,900
Right, she isn't. She went
out with Chopper earlier.

194
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,730
--What?!
--She said she was going shopping.

195
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,320
What the hell?! Then are you
the only one on the ship?

196
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,700
What a boring environment!

197
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,290
You got that right.

198
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,000
All right, then. I'll go grocery shopping, too.

199
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,130
So make sure you watch the ship good.

200
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,840
Geez, he's already asleep.

201
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,760
Well, fine. I'll leave the ship to you.

202
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,500
We're here!

203
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,220
So this is the world's No. 1 shipyard!
Downtown Water Seven!

204
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,560
As expected, I see more ground around here.

205
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,400
Things are huge all over!

206
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,860
I've never seen a huge town like this!

207
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,570
Seeing that fountain up close
makes it look especially big!

208
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,960
Hm?

209
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,500
What's with that crowd?

210
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,210
Aren't they watching the shipyard?

211
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,470
Let's go see it! Go, Yagara!

212
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,390
Hey, look over there!
It's Lucci-san! He's so handsome!

213
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,060
Isn't Paulie here?

214
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,570
Lulu's here! How refined he is!
He's truly a man's man.

215
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,070
Who's manlier than Tilestone?

216
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,030
--Hey, pops.
--Hm?

217
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,580
Did something happen?

218
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,420
Yeah. It seems that some pirates
caused a ruckus at this here Dock #1.

219
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,590
But, well, it ended when the
craftsmen knocked them down.

220
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,550
There's no end to those fools.

221
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,430
Shipwrights beat pirates up?

222
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh, you must be a voyager.

223
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,010
That crowd is... well, in short, busybodies.

224
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,480
Those shipwrights at the Galley-La
Company are admired by all the residents.

225
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,440
They're strong...

226
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,440
...and skilled.

227
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,360
They're the pride of Water Seven.

228
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,790
Wow, I'm looking forward to meeting them!

229
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,370
Ahh...!

230
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,420
Hey, Luffy!

231
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,750
Hm?

232
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,630
Let's hurry up and go to
the money-changing shop.

233
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,420
We can come back here later.

234
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,050
Okay!

235
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,150
It says that we're in the
backstreet shopping district.

236
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,110
They call a place this lively the backstreet?

237
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,570
So they have places that
we can walk around, huh?

238
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,070
The water is clear and the town is beautiful.

239
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,070
Yeah.

240
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,700
Scary!

241
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,790
Wow!

242
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,420
What a beautiful lady!

243
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,130
Such beauty hasn't been
seen for the last 100 years!

244
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,550
Err...

245
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,090
This place is full of Sanjis...

246
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,970
Whoa! What's that?!

247
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,600
That's a mask shop.

248
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,900
I've noticed people are walking
around in town wearing those masks.

249
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,690
Oh, so they're wearing them, huh?
I thought those were weird faces.

250
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,070
It sounds like they're holding a
costume carnival every day right now

251
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,620
on San Faldo, an island you
take the sea train to get to.

252
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,790
What? How come you know that?

253
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,960
People walking by are talking about it.

254
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,630
I'm surprised that you can hear them.

255
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,960
It's a habit...

256
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,130
Since my childhood, I've lived by trying to judge
people's feelings and listening in on them.

257
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,350
You're amazing, Robin.

258
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,810
--Doctor...
--Hm?

259
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,070
Over there! There's a bookstore.

260
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,650
Really?!

261
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,150
Can we stop by here?!

262
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,490
Of course! Let's go inside.

263
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,450
All right!

264
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,960
CP9...

265
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,730
Robin! I'm gonna go on ahead and go in, okay?

266
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,520
If I'm in my human form... it may be okay.

267
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,980
Oh?

268
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,270
Wow, what a cool mask!
What're you dressed up as?

269
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,980
Y-Yeah... A human reindeer.

270
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,280
If you're having fun, that's what's important.

271
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,910
Oh?

272
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,040
Robin?

273
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,000
Hello?!

274
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,250
Robin?!

275
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,000
I thought we were attacking you in your sleep...

276
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,970
Who are you bastards?!

277
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,970
Identify yourselves!

278
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,070
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

279
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,610
Chasing after something constant

280
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,200
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

281
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,490
Even when we're exhausted

282
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,660
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

283
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,090
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

284
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,010
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

285
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

286
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,760
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

287
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,850
Eternally... Eternally...

288
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,640
Wild fantasies from our childhood

289
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,480
We trace unforgettable memories

290
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,150
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

291
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

292
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,780
Together we entrust our feelings

293
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,370
We go beyond the changing time

294
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,080
Eternally... Eternally...

295
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,920
Incredible! Usopp flew in the sky!

296
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,380
Yeah! Hm? Hey, I'm right here.

297
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,840
Come to think of it, that Usopp
has a square-ish nose.

298
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,850
--When it comes to guys,
nothing beats a round nose!
--Well, welcome, Straw Hat.

299
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,390
I'm Iceberg, the boss of this city.

300
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,850
Are you a big shot, pops?
Then please repair our ship!

301
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,020
--Sure.
--Whoa, that sounded frivolous!
Is it okay to be that frivolous?

302
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,650
"The Franky Family and Iceberg-san"

304
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,650
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
