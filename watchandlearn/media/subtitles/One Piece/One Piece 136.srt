00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,580
"Zenny of the Island of Goats and
the Pirate Ship In the Mountains!"

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,420
After them! Don't let them escape!

21
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,930
Here I thought they were these great pirates,

22
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,980
but these fainthearted guys are
just running away, aren't they?

23
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,680
Sergeant, let's be the ones who
bring in the Straw Hat pirates!

24
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,850
We'll bring them in, for sure!

25
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,530
Come on! If we don't do something,
they really will hit us!

26
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm too hungry...

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,110
Me, too...

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,300
Man, these navy guys are pesky.

29
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,180
Haven't you caught anything yet?

30
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,370
It's not a matter of catching something!

31
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,670
There isn't a single drop of water left!

32
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,090
At this rate, we're either going
to shrivel up, or die of starvation.

33
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,150
Robin-chan, it's time for afternoon tea.

34
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,280
Would you care for some
mille-feuille, as well?

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,970
Thank you, mister cook.

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
I want a snack, too!

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,060
Sanji, where the hell did
you have that hidden?!

38
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,030
Hey! You guys keep your mitts off of this!

39
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,490
What's with the lack of a sense of urgency?!

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,830
Is this any time to be laughing?!

41
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,670
Nami, this sea looks even
more alarming than the navy.

42
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,440
Use your navigating skills and do something!

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,170
I know!

44
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,250
More fog?

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,800
We might be able to use this
fog to give the navy the slip.

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,550
But this water is moving fast.
What's more, there are reefs everywhere.

47
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,110
This region of the ocean is designated
as a class-one danger zone!

48
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,620
Pursuing them any farther is impossible!

49
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,840
If this keeps up, we'll be wiped out!

50
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,830
Silence! We've chased them this far!

51
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,400
We've almost got them, you know!

52
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Sergeant, let's finish this now!

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,810
Withdraw. Come about at once.

54
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,050
We've got orders from Captain Moore

55
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,520
that once we spot the Straw Hat pirates,
we are to eliminate them!

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,190
Stop pestering me!

57
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,610
The captain is not in command
right now. I am. Understood?

58
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,280
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,840
Hard aport! Pull the sail 45° to the left!

60
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,650
We're out of the fog.

61
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,970
Hey, an island! I see an island!

62
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,180
I wonder if it has something to eat!

63
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,740
Six people and one animal...

64
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,250
Doesn't matter how many
of you damn pirates there are.

65
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,130
Just you watch this...

66
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,010
Maybe it's uninhabited.

67
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,320
--A goat?
--M-Meat!

68
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,100
Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat!

69
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,720
Hold on! I don't care how hungry you are,

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,540
you can't just go after that cute little goat!

71
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,210
Apparently, the cute little goats
have taken a liking to us.

72
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,680
It's a trap! We've fallen into their trap!

73
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,040
We have no choice!

74
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,490
Don't cut them, Zoro!

75
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,800
These guys aren't bad! I can tell that much!

76
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,280
Tabasco Star!!

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
The goat kicked it back.

78
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,120
Usopp!

79
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,660
Wait! We're not going to eat
you or anything! I promise!

80
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,040
But why did you all set a trap for us?!

81
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,380
Huh? They were ordered by somebody to do it!

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,010
Somebody who?

83
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,970
Stop!

84
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,850
You idiot! Keep out of the way!

85
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,020
Watch out!

86
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,610
Stop it!

87
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,780
I-It's a monster!

88
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,660
A weird old man fell out of there.

89
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,040
Chopper, is this the man who
gave the goats their orders?

90
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,440
How about it?

91
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,710
They say yes.

92
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,670
He must have thought we
were here to attack him.

93
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,760
Don't worry. We just want
some water and provisions.

94
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,700
How can I trust anything a pirate says?!

95
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,770
I'm telling you right now, there's no
treasure on this island, got it?!

96
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,230
I am penniless!

97
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,230
You don't look very rich, in any case.

98
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,870
Damn pirates! If that's how you
want it, I'll be a man about it!

99
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,900
Simmer me, bake me, do whatever you will!

100
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,870
Oh, really? I'm a cook.
Simmering and baking are my specialty.

101
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,720
Wait! Wait! I was just joking!
You fiend! You scoundrel! You killer!

102
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,360
He's gone limp.

103
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,640
The old man's grit is amazing,
but he's pretty fainthearted.

104
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,520
Oh, no! His heart has stopped!

105
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,740
--Zoro!
--You ogre!

106
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,280
--How cruel!
--Mossy.

107
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,480
Now, hold on, it's not like that!

108
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,940
I'm a doctor! Let's hurry and
take the old man to his house!

109
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,060
I was very nearly killed out there.

110
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,040
You really can't drop your
guard around a pirate.

111
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
Listen to you! You fainted all on your own.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Old goat man, did your
heart stop out of shock?

113
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Here in the Grand Line,
there must be surprises every day.

114
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,350
I'm surprised you've lasted this long,
with that faint heart of yours.

115
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,880
That's the truth!

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,200
Still, we're glad that you're life isn't in danger.

117
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,940
What's there to be glad about?!

118
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,920
You've already scared the hell
out of me, and nearly got me killed.

119
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,440
What's more, now I can't chop
firewood, or draw any water.

120
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,910
I'm out a whole bunch, here!

121
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,060
Altogether, I've lost 50,000,000 Berries!

122
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,020
You're overcharging, aren't you?
At the most, it should be this much.

123
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,760
Now you're being stingy!
Even with a huge discount, it's this.

124
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,340
If you subtract Chopper's
consultation fee, it's this.

125
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,020
All you young folks ganging up
to pick on an old man like me...!

126
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,040
You're heartless!

127
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,590
We're not picking on you!

128
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,760
Ah, I can't go on anymore!

129
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,900
Don't cry.

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,050
All right, old goat man.

131
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,460
We'll chop your wood
and draw your water for you.

132
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,250
You're the reasonable sort,
aren't you, my straw-hatted lad?

133
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,820
We have a deal.

134
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,300
That old guy sure did seem
to dislike pirates, huh?

135
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,580
Do you think he has
some grudge against them?

136
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,890
They say the old man is
the only person on the island,

137
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,300
and that it's been 20 years since
he washed up here from somewhere.

138
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,020
20 years?!

139
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,020
We've met someone like that before, huh?

140
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,760
Oh, where are you going, Zoro?

141
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,350
Huh? I'm going to go look
for something to eat.

142
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,580
I doubt the old man is going
to share anything with us.

143
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,800
Oh, right! In that case, get some meat!

144
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,860
Don't ask for too much!

145
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,160
Put your back into it more!

146
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,790
Can't you youngsters even
chop wood right these days?

147
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,170
I thought so. This cleaning is no good.

148
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,100
Do this over, here!

149
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,690
After that, get some grass to
the island goats, and fix the hut!

150
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,790
Ah, I'm so tired... Don't just
stand there, rub my shoulders!

151
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,880
You might pay me a little mind,
without me having to tell you everything.

152
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
You people really are so
much trouble. After that...

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,100
There's more?

154
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,070
Damn it, which way is north,
and which way is south?

155
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,790
What's that?

156
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,400
That's...

157
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,230
I finally made it back.

158
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Are you guys still at it?

159
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,110
That old-timer has been pushing
work on us, one job after another.

160
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,990
We're all worn out.

161
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,860
I'm so hungry...

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,210
A pirate ship?

163
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,670
The ship was run down, but it
was definitely a pirate ship.

164
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,690
Who made it?

165
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,250
The old guy is the only one here.

166
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,230
Why would the old-timer build a pirate ship?

167
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,470
How should I know?

168
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,970
We just might be in luck here.

169
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,810
In any event, let's go have a look.

170
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,840
You say it's at the top of the mountain?

171
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,020
Let's go see!

172
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,730
Whoa, there's no need to run, right?

173
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,810
Hey, wait! It'll take too long
to get there starting now!

174
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,440
You're right.

175
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,460
Damn, it was this close, in a straight line?

176
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,880
It seems creepy somehow, doesn't it?

177
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,490
Like a ghost ship in the mountains, huh?

178
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,540
Robin, don't say anything like that.

179
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,750
What are those?

180
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,420
Spirits of the dead! Didn't I tell you so?!

181
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,940
They're fireflies!

182
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,680
He used lumber from the local trees.

183
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,390
But it looks like he stopped midway through.

184
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,140
The old guy really did this?

185
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,230
It doesn't look like it's here.

186
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,200
What's not here, Nami?

187
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,400
Treasure.

188
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,900
Treasure?

189
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,990
If my guess is correct, that old man is,
in actual fact, a former pirate!

190
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,450
A pirate?

191
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,260
He probably got shipwrecked,

192
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,560
and I'll bet he's the only one
who made it to this island.

193
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,490
And so, he was building this
pirate ship to get off the island.

194
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,620
Yeah, but a former pirate disliking pirates

195
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,090
doesn't make any sense, does it?

196
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,670
That's just simple camouflage,

197
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,480
to keep us from finding
the treasure he's hidden.

198
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,920
I thought he was shady, right from the start.

199
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,130
Remember that furniture in the old man's hut?

200
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,750
He had some pretty valuable
things together there.

201
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,820
That's my Nami-san! Very astute!

202
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,800
That can't be right.

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,990
There's no way that fainthearted
old man was once a pirate.

204
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,460
Yeah, but he might have been
a famous pirate long ago.

205
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,950
And above all else, there's this ship.

206
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,040
There's a dense forest ahead, with no paths...

207
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,180
...and a steep cliff to the rear.

208
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,910
If he's going to build a boat to escape on,

209
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,970
why do it up here in the mountains?

210
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,340
Why, Nami?

211
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,310
W-Well...

212
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,490
"Justice"

213
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,820
Why did you turn back?
A danger zone, you say?

214
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,910
Do you think you can fear those,
and still preserve the navy's justice?!

215
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,010
I'm terribly sorry. But it
won't be possible for them

216
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,170
to get out of that danger
zone so easily, either.

217
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,130
They couldn't have gotten too far away.

218
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,330
Even Smoker, and Hina,
leader of the Black Cage Unit,

219
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,920
let the Straw Hat pirates slip away from them,

220
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,100
but we will stop them at
my hand, no matter what!

221
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,560
They will be of no matter, once they
are within your grasp, Captain.

222
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,290
Begin a search at once! Go locate
where the Straw Hat pirates are!

223
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,150
Yes, sir!

224
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,970
--Uh, Captain...
--Let's go, Corporal.

225
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,820
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,020
Why didn't you report
that island to the captain?

227
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,800
You saw it, too?

228
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,880
Yes. I saw the island, not recorded
anywhere in that area of the sea.

229
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,540
Let's keep that from the captain
for a little while. Got it?

230
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,100
Why? The Straw Hat pirates
are probably on that island.

231
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,680
Allow me to let you in on something.

232
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,170
The one who put down
Crocodile in Alabasta was...

233
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,770
Yes, sir, Captain Smoker, hero of the navy.

234
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,190
You're such a dumbass.

235
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,120
That turns out to be the official
statement, nothing more.

236
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,650
Then, who exactly was it?

237
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,070
Those Straw Hat pirates, apparently.

238
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,130
If we took those guys on,

239
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,210
no matter how many lives
we had, it wouldn't be enough.

240
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,160
But, sir...

241
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,080
Hey, don't believe everything
you hear from the higher-ups.

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,590
If we were to fight them head-on,
they'd wipe us out like it was nothing.

243
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,410
Never mind them, I need you to give
me a hand with something, Corporal.

244
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,480
You need a hand?

245
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,770
Let's get off this island, right away.

246
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,810
If this keeps up, that funny old man

247
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,610
is just going to keep slave-driving us.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,410
--I'm staying here.
--Luffy?

249
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,180
I want to eat! I can't fill up on just this stuff!

250
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,140
Ah! It's all gone!

251
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
Why, you...!

252
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,130
--I had to go out looking for that food!
--For the time being, let's head back to the ship.

253
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,590
Ah, Chopper, we're going back to the ship.

254
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm going to stay by the old man's side.

255
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,220
I can't just abandon one
of my patients, after all.

256
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,600
But he's gotten better. If you feel
sorry for him, there'll be no end to it.

257
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,680
There will be an end.

258
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,130
What do you mean?

259
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,650
An end?

260
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,900
That old man's heart didn't
stop just because he's timid.

261
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,240
He's sick.

262
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,110
So by "there will be an end," you mean...?

263
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,570
There's no doubt about it.
That old man only has three days left.

264
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,180
What?

265
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,620
Three days, you say?

266
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,900
I sure slept well.

267
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
That smells good.

268
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,430
--Good morning, old-timer!
--Breakfast is ready.

269
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,520
W-What is all this?!

270
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,140
Sanji is a noted cook, so this is delicious!

271
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,830
The island goats told me where the fruit is,

272
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,550
and some points where the fishing was good.

273
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,440
Come on, hurry, hurry.

274
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,350
Nami-chan, I'm warning you,
I don't have a penny to pay with.

275
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,760
You don't have to worry about that.

276
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,320
Something's fishy here. Way too fishy for me.

277
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,160
There's a proverb about this, you know.

278
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,260
"Beware of pirates that suddenly become nice."

279
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,880
There isn't any poison in this, is there?

280
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,340
How rude.

281
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,480
It's only natural to be kind
to the elderly, isn't it?

282
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,900
If you don't want any, I'll eat it for you.

283
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,190
Hold on! I'm eating, I'm eating!

284
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,580
What's the matter with you?!

285
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,950
Old-timer, are you okay?!

286
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,060
--Hey, don't startle him!
--Sorry.

287
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,600
Oh, so you've eaten a
Devil Fruit, too, have you?

288
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,570
Yum! It truly has been a long time
since I've had anything this good.

289
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,660
Old-timer, if there's anything we
can do for you, just ask us, okay?

290
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,160
Make sure you don't leave behind any regrets.

291
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,630
Nobody asked you!

292
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,960
If you like this kind of food,
I'll make it for you, anytime.

293
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,220
You will, huh? Well, thanks.
Wow, this really is good.

294
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,430
This is terribly yummy.
This goes beyond yummy!

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,260
What's the matter, old goat man?!

296
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,310
--Don't tell me...!
--It's happening already?!

297
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,450
--Oh, no!
--Hey, stay with us!

298
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,130
Whew! It was so good,
I rushed through eating it,

299
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,780
and got it stuck in my throat.

300
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,710
Oh, your food got stuck in your throat, did it?

301
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,380
Don't scare us like that.

302
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,280
I was sure it was too soon for that.

303
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
Too soon for what?

304
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,960
N-Nothing at all! He means
you're eating too quick, old-timer.

305
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
Never mind him, have some of mine, too.

306
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,850
And mine, too.

307
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,310
Help yourself to this, too.

308
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,980
Really?! Much obliged, much obliged!

309
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,030
This really is good!

310
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,790
His appetite is on the same
level as Luffy's, isn't it?

311
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Does he really only have three days left to live?

312
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,220
Here it is, Sergeant!

313
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,670
According to the records,
there was a man who fought

314
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,980
against some pirates in that
area of the sea 20 years ago,

315
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,640
and hasn't been seen since.

316
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
I remember now. He was a guy
named Zenny, or something.

317
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,560
Zenny?

318
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
The bastard wasn't the
only thing that went missing.

319
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,690
A huge treasure disappeared with him.

320
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,980
Supposing he made it to that island,

321
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,710
and even if he has already kicked the bucket...

322
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,290
Treasure doesn't have a
life expectancy, does it?

323
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,040
You've already eaten too much!

324
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm just getting started.

325
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,840
You're awesome, mister!

326
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,850
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

327
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:28,030
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

328
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:43,800
There are days where I almost lose to myself

329
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:51,790
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

330
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,330
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

331
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:08,340
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

332
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,600
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

333
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,640
This unique moment...

334
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,190
How long are we going to have
to look after the old man?

335
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,000
My, how cold.

336
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,390
Whether he's a pirate, or has treasure,
it's none of our business, right?

337
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,850
You should embrace a more inquisitive mind.

338
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,600
Our pursuers from the navy
are already that close!

339
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
--Oh, are you scared?
--I'm not talking to you!

340
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,920
On the next episode of One Piece!

341
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,940
"How's Tricks? The Designs
of Zenny the Moneylender!"

342
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
