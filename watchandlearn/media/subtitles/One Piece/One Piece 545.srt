Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,300
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,590
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

74
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

76
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,560
On their way to the New World,

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,940
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

78
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,240
where the New Fish-Man Pirates

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,780
who are looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom...

80
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,950
...assisted by Vander Decken,
who is after Shirahoshi,

81
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,460
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

82
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,530
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil.

83
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,590
If I join the Warlords,

84
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,620
Aladdin and the others who
don't want to be pirates...

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,220
...can live in this country
without being chased

86
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,340
under the amnesty of the Government.

87
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,390
Big Brother is dead!

88
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,220
We'll go our own way, just like we used to!

89
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,940
The Sun Pirates split into three groups

90
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,470
and went separate ways.

91
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,680
"Shaking Fish-Man Island! A
Celestial Dragon Drifts In!"

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,670
THE FISH-MAN ISLAND

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm back!

94
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,970
I still can't believe that this day has come!

95
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,510
When we were the Celestial Dragons' slaves,

96
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,390
we were hopeless and all we
had was hatred toward them.

97
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,880
We got away from the Celestial
Dragons thanks to Boss Tai

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,840
but still they were looking for us.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,400
I thought being a pirate was
the only way to survive.

100
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,650
But now we can even go back to
our hometown without hiding!

101
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,370
We are free!

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,390
Captain! No, Brother Jimbei!

103
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,370
I'll never forget what you've done for us!

104
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't be so dramatic.

105
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,540
I won't, but we know what you did.

106
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,970
You needed the amnesty of the
Government to help free us.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,860
That's why you joined the Warlords.

108
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,680
It's not as though you wanted to join them.

109
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,850
Quit this chatting and go
to your family already!

110
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,020
Look! They're becoming impatient.

111
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,610
--Honey...
--Dad!

112
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,130
--Baby...
--Just go to them.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
--Dad!
--Honey!

114
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,980
Aladdin, you were a slave just like them.

115
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,920
But now you can get off of the ship finally.

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,520
Jimbei.

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,890
We will no longer be chased
as renegade slaves.

118
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,720
All of us can stay with family without fear.

119
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,930
But just like the mark
of the Celestial Dragons,

120
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,310
because of our terrible experience as
slaves, our hatred toward humans...

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,980
...will never go away!

122
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,200
Of course I understand what
Brother Tai truly meant...

123
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,490
But...

124
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,970
I can't believe that Boss Jimbei

125
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,200
is becoming a tool of the
World Government... or humans!

126
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,010
Did he forget who killed Tiger-san?

127
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,260
I've lost respect for Boss Jimbei.

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
I knew that there were many islanders

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,140
who didn't like the idea
of me joining the Warlords.

130
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,530
THE RYUGU PALACE

131
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,190
Thanks to Jimbei's momentous decision,

132
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,910
now we have a relationship
with the World Government.

133
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,320
In order to use this opportunity to
establish friendly relations with humans,

134
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,830
I will keep trying hard!

135
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,590
But even if it's for his friends,

136
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,130
I can't believe Jimbei took
on such a big burden-jamon.

137
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,170
When he gets an order from
the World Government,

138
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,770
he has no choice but to fight...

139
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,060
...whether he likes it or not-jamon.

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,190
He will put himself in
harm's way and occasionally

141
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,940
his blood will be spilled.

142
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,110
I know.

143
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,420
I won't let Jimbei's sacrifice end up wasted.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,690
I have to do my best, as well!

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,760
But don't push yourself too hard.

146
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,990
Because I don't want you to
suffer another hangover-jamon!

147
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,290
Oh...

148
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,290
And then something happened that would

149
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,300
change Queen Otohime's life forever.

150
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,070
An uninvited visitor came to the island...

151
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,870
Ryugu Kingdom! Ryugu Kingdom!

152
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,770
This is border patrol speaking!

153
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,560
A huge wrecked ship is seeking
emergency entry into the country!

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,520
What are you waiting for?!
Accept them already...

155
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,070
It can't be true!

156
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,490
A Celestial Dragon is on board!

157
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,030
What?!

158
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,330
King Neptune!

159
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,330
A Celestial Dragon?!

160
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,630
Accept them!

161
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,500
--Send a rescue team immediately!
--Yes, ma'am!

162
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,250
I'll meet them myself!

163
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,920
Otohime-sama!

164
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,580
What is a Celestial Dragon
doing on the seafloor?

165
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,860
It's a Celestial Dragon's ship!

166
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,180
Must've been attacked by
some deep-sea creature.

167
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,260
They look down on us Fish-Men.

168
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,350
How come they were in such deep water?

169
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,270
Hurry up!

170
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,700
Damn! They are all dead! What weaklings!

171
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,200
Bring me a breathing mask now, you fishes!

172
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:26,060
A WORLD NOBLE (CELESTIAL
DRAGON) SAINT MYOSGARD

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,860
I can't stand this Fish-man's smell!

174
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,110
Bring me a mask now!

175
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,700
Hurry up and save my life, you fools!

176
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,500
He has no respect of us!

177
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,090
That's not how you ask somebody to help you!

178
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,390
Doctor!

179
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,650
I need a doctor!

180
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,010
--Is a medical team here?
--They're here but...

181
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,360
...they don't know what to do with "it."

182
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,080
We have to kill him.

183
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,280
They are the scum of the world!

184
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,820
The Seven Warlords are nothing!

185
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm not gonna work for the World Government

186
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,450
or anybody, even if they beg me to!

187
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,480
That's our Captain Vander Decken!

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,250
Jimbei is no match for me as
a pirate in the first place,

189
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,950
no match at all, I suspect!

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,100
Hm? What's going on at the harbor?

191
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,620
Hey.

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,790
Captain, he said that a
Celestial Dragon is here.

193
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,940
Celestial Dragon?

194
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,360
Looks like his ship has wrecked
and he's asking for help.

195
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,480
Sounds like fun. Let's go see it.

196
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,220
This wasn't how it was supposed to be...

197
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,460
What?! The Fish-Man slaves
went back to their island?!

198
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,300
Why is it, My Daddy?

199
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,350
Here is the thing, My Son.

200
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,890
A Fish-Man named Jimbei just
joined the Seven Warlords.

201
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,560
Jimbei?

202
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,920
And the Sun Pirates which he belongs
to were hiding all those slaves

203
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,610
but their evasion charges were
dropped by the amnesty of the

204
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,480
Government so they went back home, My Son.

205
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,620
I think the slaves who escaped from
my place are among them, My Daddy.

206
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,390
I'm sure of it.

207
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,850
It makes me sick to think
that they are living a

208
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,500
free and easy life now.

209
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm gonna go get them back, My Daddy!

210
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,820
Because I've spent a lot of money
to collect those Fish-Man slaves!

211
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,680
Gee! I didn't know that the deep
sea was such a horrifying place.

212
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,380
Hey, what are you guys doing?

213
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,810
What?

214
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,450
It's been a while, huh? Myosgard.

215
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,830
How dare you address me without my title! Oh?

216
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,210
Oh, you were my slaves!

217
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,800
You just have to come home with me!

218
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,380
I didn't give you my permission
to be free, fishes!

219
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,680
D-Don't do it, guys!

220
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,090
He's a Celestial Dragon!

221
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,560
If you kill him, the
amnesty will become void!

222
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,110
Don't do it, fools! Know your place!

223
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,990
Who do you think I am?!

224
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,410
I'm... I'm...

225
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,390
The Navy admirals will come to the aid of a

226
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,980
Celestial Dragon in danger
in the world above.

227
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,210
That's why people are afraid of your folk.

228
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,240
But you're on the Fish-Man
Island at the seafloor.

229
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,840
As long as the islanders stay quiet,
whatever happens to you here,

230
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,380
they'll think it was an accident.

231
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,350
He's right...

232
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,200
--I won't say anything!
--Me too! Of course!

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,040
He's barely alive. He's
gonna die soon anyway!

234
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,360
Let him suffer the same
way that you slaves did!

235
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,900
--Kill him!
--Make him suffer!

236
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,190
Show him no mercy!

237
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,250
What's going on?

238
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,990
I thought I was a respected man...

239
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,160
For the life of me...

240
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,250
I can't forgive you!

241
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
Hey, don't!

242
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
--Do it!
--Kill him!

243
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,010
Don't do it!

244
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,970
You stupid fishes!

245
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,390
Queen Otohime!!

246
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,420
The Queen has been shot!

247
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,700
Queen Otohime...

248
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,000
Everybody, drop your gun!

249
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,410
Children are watching!

250
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,800
Aladdin!

251
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,910
Where is the Celestial Dragon
who's ship was wrecked?!

252
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,760
I just got here, myself.

253
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,990
Boss Jimbei!

254
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,640
Our mother rushed out of the palace!

255
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,890
What?

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,610
Brother-sama, who are the Celestial Dragons?

257
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,060
They are humans, Shirahoshi.

258
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,280
Humans?

259
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,010
There are quite a few humans out
there and they are the scary ones.

260
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,220
I heard some gunshots too.

261
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,110
Let's go.

262
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,470
O-Otohime-sama...

263
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,820
It's just a scratch.

264
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,780
Why do you protect him?

265
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,450
You don't know what he did to us in the past!

266
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,970
He treated us like we were
animals, not even slaves.

267
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,440
I can feel your anguish - it's very painful.

268
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,010
Mother-sama!

269
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,400
Mother-sama!

270
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,700
I know it's hard but...

271
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,450
...you can't plant your anger and resentment
toward humans in children's mind!

272
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,890
They need a chance to meet humans
and figure them out on their own.

273
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,810
So, please!

274
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,100
Don't tell the people on the island anything!

275
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,230
Neither the tragedy we endured
nor of our anger towards humans!

276
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,250
Brother Tai...

277
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,230
Watch out, Mother-sama!

278
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,120
Don't move!

279
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
Oh no! Your Majesty!

280
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,670
Mother!

281
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,460
That bastard!

282
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,410
Queen?

283
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,720
To a Celestial Dragon like me,

284
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,250
the Queen of a fish country
is just another commoner...

285
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,720
...or even less!

286
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,360
What an asshole!

287
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,820
Mother-sama!

288
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,070
You fools! What are you doing?!

289
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,990
Get me a mask and a doctor! Otherwise...

290
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,460
Mother-sama!!

291
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,750
What?!

292
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,420
It's the Sea Kings!!

293
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,300
What was that?

294
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,960
It didn't look like a coincidence...

295
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,150
Shirahoshi... Don't tell me you are...

296
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
What's the matter, Captain?

297
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,120
According to the family legend, a long
long time ago, there was a Mermaid...

298
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,460
...who possessed mysterious power that
could even control the Sea Kings!

299
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,970
Vander Decken I decided to look into
the legend and headed for the seafloor.

300
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,180
My ancestors! I finally found her!

301
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,560
Shirahoshi is the legendary Mermaid?

302
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,190
You did it, Captain!

303
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,070
Shh! Don't let anybody hear about it.

304
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,820
It's a secret legend that only
my family knows, I suspect!

305
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,450
If I can control the Sea Kings as
I wish, I can do anything I want.

306
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,160
I can have anything I want!

307
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,110
So, what are we gonna do now?

308
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,210
Kidnap Princess Shirahoshi?

309
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,010
First, I have to marry her.

310
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,080
What?!

311
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,060
But she's still a kid now.

312
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,020
Hmmm... that's the problem!

313
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,310
Aladdin...

314
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,610
Let me treat him.

315
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,030
Thank you.

316
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,200
I'll treat you next.

317
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,900
A few weeks later,

318
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,130
when the Celestial Dragon
who's life has been saved was

319
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,580
about to leave for home,

320
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,780
Queen Otohime did an unexpected thing.

321
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,390
I'll get even with you!

322
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,730
Although I'm a respected
World Noble, you insulted me

323
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,730
and harassed me terribly.

324
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,200
You fishes, I'll make you
feel sorry for what you did!

325
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,280
Is that what we get for saving his life?

326
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,700
We provided a ship and
crew for him to go home!

327
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,540
How could he say that?!

328
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,020
We shouldn't let him go! It's
dangerous to this island!

329
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,790
Wait a minute!

330
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,920
You seem like you have more to say.

331
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,550
In that case, I'll come with
you to the world above.

332
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,710
To the world above?!

333
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,680
That's too dangerous, Otohime-sama!

334
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,930
Mother-sama!

335
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,800
Wait-jamon, Otohime! I won't let you do that!

336
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,770
If you wish to negotiate
with the Nobles, I'll go!

337
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm sure humans won't catch you

338
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,360
since you're the King and a Great Knight.

339
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,780
Then let me...

340
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,240
No, there is no point if
it's a strong man like you!

341
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,850
We have to show that

342
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,370
even a weak woman can
go there and return home

343
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,550
if we want to prove to our nation
it's totally safe up there.

344
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,330
I'm physically more fragile than
anyone - that's why it makes

345
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,390
more sense for me to go.

346
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,760
--Mother-sama!
--Mother-sama!

347
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,330
Otohime-sama!

348
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,810
Where are you going, Otohime-sama?

349
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,610
Otohime...

350
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,250
Trust the woman who you chose to be your wife

351
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,000
and the humans.

352
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,280
She's just a fish queen - how arrogant!

353
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,480
Mother-sama!

354
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,100
Mother-sama!

355
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,870
Jimbei...

356
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,240
No one can stop her.

357
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,850
All we can do is trust her and wait.

358
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,130
Your Majesty! Please be careful!

359
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,030
Otohime-sama!

360
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,420
Mother-sama!

361
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,030
Otohime brought a single
paper back from the surface.

362
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,970
It represents a light of
hope for Fish-Man Island.

363
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,150
Gathering numerous signatures,

364
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,590
her dream becomes the dream
of all of Fish-Man Island.

365
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,200
Fish-Man Island seemed ready to change,

366
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,340
when all of a sudden,

367
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,440
a gunshot rings out across
all of Fish-Man Island!

368
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

369
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,880
"A Sudden Tragedy! A Gunshot
Shuts Down the Future!"

370
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
