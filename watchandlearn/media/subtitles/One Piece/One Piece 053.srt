00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,610
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!!

22
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,260
A storm is coming.
An unimaginably big storm is...!

23
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,680
Out of our way!

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,580
I'm... dead.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm still alive after all.

26
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,700
I got lucky.

27
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,240
Are these all coincidences?

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,980
It's as if heaven is trying
to let that man live.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,550
We'd better hurry
or we'll be in trouble!

30
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,570
We're gonna make it to
the Grand Line like this!

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,710
"The Legend Has Started!
Head For The Grand Line"

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,520
Inherited will...

33
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,500
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

34
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,350
These things cannot be stopped.

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,850
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

36
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,490
these things will never cease to be!

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,350
A pirate, huh? Fine by me.

38
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,800
What's with this storm?!

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,270
If we don't leave soon,
we'll be stuck here.

40
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,280
Nami-san was right when she said
we should hurry back to the ship!

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,550
Run! Run! Run!

42
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,830
Special Move:
My Carnival of Colors!

43
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,070
Pardon me!

44
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,640
Attacking me is a waste of time.

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,140
There isn't a man alive
who can touch my smooth skin.

46
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,650
For a second there,
I saw a field filled with flowers.

47
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,120
You're alive, Captain Buggy.

48
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,910
No way I'd die!

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,660
Buggy, this isn't good!

50
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,720
They're marines from headquarters.
There'll be no end to them!

51
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,660
Humph. I could care less if the
marines want to stick their nose into...

52
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,680
Whose nose did you say is sticking out?!

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
I didn't say anything like that!

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,550
What're we going to do?

55
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,640
Gum-Gum! Go after Gum-Gum!

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,480
Mohji and Richie should have
burned down his ship by now.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,400
He can't get off of this island.

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,340
We'll kick his ass and
leave this island, guys!!

59
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah!!

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,640
Motor!!

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,490
Yes, Captain!

62
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,480
Chop-Chop Buggy! Here we go!

63
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,770
Igniting the bomb engine!

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,360
Set the slope!

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes, Big Sis Alvida!

66
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,920
No friction...

67
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,640
Smooth-Smooth Tracks!

68
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,690
Don't let the pirates get away!

69
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,880
Wh... What's this smoke?!

70
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,470
What the hell...?!

71
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,350
White Out!

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,270
Smoker!

73
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,740
I don't have time for you, small fries!

74
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,470
H-He's too strong!

75
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,340
So that's the power
of Plume-Plume Fruit...

76
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,740
He took down Buggy's
gang in a split second...

77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,510
Fire!

78
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,290
Captain! He caught
us all in one fell swoop!

79
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
How dare you, Smoker!

80
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,340
What's with this annoying steel net?!
Firing a weird pistol like that...

81
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,110
That was a "Cage Shot" developed by
the Navy to deal with Devil Fruit powers.

82
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,820
Dammit!

83
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,510
Bring my Billower Bike here!
We'll go after Straw Hat!

84
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,310
Yes, sir!

85
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,980
This is heavy!

86
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,900
The Going Merry is in danger!

87
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,980
The Navy might be
already heading toward it!

88
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,870
We have to get out as soon as possible!

89
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,130
Nami! Nami!
Can't I just ditch this thing?

90
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,770
No, you can't! Run faster!

91
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,310
I knew you'd say that.

92
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,390
Dammit! What's with
this sudden downpour,

93
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,260
when we have to burn down this ship?!

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,640
Dammit! This is bad, Richie!
We can't get a fire going like this!

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,380
One more time!

96
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,280
Be patient, Richie! I'll feed you later.

97
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,280
What're you doing?!

98
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,440
Mohji!

99
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,710
Oh, it's you, sneak thief woman.

100
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
Go, Richie!

101
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,830
Special Attack: Fresh Egg Star!!

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,970
You...

103
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,750
Damn! The rain made my hand slip!

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,390
Richie!! You're such a...!!

105
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,650
Now! Let's get on the ship!

106
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,300
Yeah!

107
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,270
Hold it! You have to get past me!

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,980
I'm Mohji, Vice-Captain of
the Buggy the Clown Pirates!

109
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,310
I won't let you take
one step on this...

110
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,830
Prepare to fire!

111
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,540
The Navy!

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,000
This is bad!

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
Aim!

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,410
Fire!

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,460
Contact the cannon unit!
We'll capture the pirate ship!

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,880
Yes, sir!

117
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,360
N-N-N-Nami!

118
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,130
Yeah!

119
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,830
Which direction is the sea?

120
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,300
I can't tell where we're going
because of this heavy rain!

121
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,770
There they are!!

122
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,410
What persistent bastards!
Should we stop and fight?

123
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,420
We don't have time for that.

124
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,170
Oh?

125
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,820
Who's that lady?!

126
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,530
Hm?

127
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,590
I didn't realize you're Roronoa Zoro,
and a pirate to boot.

128
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,500
You gonna take this sword, too?

129
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,130
You... You lied to me!

130
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,490
What?! What'd you do to her?!

131
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,350
You didn't ask my name. That's all.

132
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,430
It's not that I lied to you.

133
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,100
A rogue like you can't be
allowed to own a renowned sword!

134
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,410
I'll collect your sword,
the legendary Wado Ichimonji!

135
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,550
Try it.

136
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,630
I see...

137
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,640
You jerk! How dare you attack a lady!

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
Please don't interfere!

139
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,570
What?

140
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,310
This is the fight between Roronoa
and me! There's no need to step in!

141
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,320
You heard her. Go on ahead.

142
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,550
Let's go.

143
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,520
Hey, Zoro! If you hurt the
lady, I won't forgive you!

144
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,290
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

145
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't let you have this
sword no matter what.

146
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,820
Sergeant Major Tashigi lost...

147
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,940
That Sergeant Major Tashigi lost...

148
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Well, then... I'm in a hurry, so...

149
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,500
Why aren't you finishing me off?!

150
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,900
Is it because I'm a woman?!

151
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,060
You're lucky, Zoro. You're a boy.

152
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,660
It's humiliating that
you won't fight seriously

153
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,360
in a game played in earnest just because
men're physically stronger than women!

154
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,890
I'm sure you don't understand the
feeling that I wish I was born a boy!

155
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,400
I don't carry a sword for pleasure!

156
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,250
I don't like your very being!

157
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,020
Listen! Your face! It looks exactly like
my close friend's who died long ago!

158
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,360
On top of that, you started saying
the same thing she used to say!

159
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,590
Don't imitate, you copycat woman!

160
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,360
What?! Stop talking
like a child! You're rude!

161
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,700
I live the way I am! I don't
know what your friend was like,

162
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,050
but I'm the one who feels upset!
Isn't she the copycat?!

163
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,560
Wh-What'd you say?!

164
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,870
I see the exit! The harbor is up there!

165
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,270
Hey, who is it this time?

166
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,600
You're finally here...

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,750
Straw Hat Luffy...

168
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,190
Didn't I tell you that you can't enter
the Grand Line unless you beat me first?

169
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,100
Oh, yeah. I forgot about it.

170
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,600
You're such an airhead...

171
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,090
Hey, Luffy...

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,010
Sanji, go on ahead. I'll be right there.

173
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,410
Well, I don't know about that.
This is the end for you.

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,070
Go!

175
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,100
Fire!

176
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,180
Fire the cannons!

177
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,620
If we stay here any longer,
the Going Merry will be sunk!

178
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,260
A-Are you going to set sail?
Luffy and the others aren't here yet!

179
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,720
We don't have any other choice!
It's better than getting sunk here!

180
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,930
Right rudder full!

181
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,720
So what're we going to do
about Luffy and the others?

182
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,570
We'll pick them up somehow.

183
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,550
Don't let them get away! Follow them!

184
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,100
Nami-san!

185
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,070
Sanji-kun!

186
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,180
Sanji!

187
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,530
Nami-san, I'm back!

188
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,400
Where're Luffy and Zoro?

189
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,370
Can we collect those damn idiots?

190
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,640
Sanji-kun!

191
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,370
Behind you!

192
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,780
Dammit! This is endless!

193
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,650
I'll cover his back! Get closer!

194
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,320
No! We can't head back to land
because of the strong current.

195
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,410
Ahhh, dammit!

196
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,300
Usopp!

197
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,170
Bastards!

198
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,500
Usopp! Sanji-kun!

199
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,660
I'll beat you and
enter the Grand Line.

200
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,130
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

201
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,410
Enough of your idle talk!

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,370
What?! What?! What's going on?!

203
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,760
I ate the Plume Plume Fruit.
So my body becomes smoke at will.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,920
What's wrong? Finished already?

205
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,770
Gum-Gum Gatling!

206
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,570
What? Ahh, that's gross!

207
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,300
White Blow!

208
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,100
You bastard! Gum-Gum Pistol!

209
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,310
You get it? You can't
even enter the Grand Line.

210
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,650
Didn't I tell you that?

211
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,250
Wanted for a 30 million Berry bounty?

212
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,250
You're running out of your devil's luck.

213
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,010
Don't be so sure.

214
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,050
You're...

215
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,230
Wh-What? Who's that? Who's that?

216
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,690
The government wants your head.

217
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,100
The world is waiting for our answer.

218
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,390
Th-This is...

219
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,960
Wh-What just happened?

220
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,650
Luffy!

221
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,020
Luffy!!

222
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,350
Nami!

223
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,390
We'd better hurry up or the
ship will be swept away!

224
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,420
Okay!

225
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Gum-Gum...

226
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,510
Wha?!

227
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,790
W-Wait!

228
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,100
I have a bad feeling...

229
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,170
...Rocket!!

230
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,110
Ahhh, I knew it!

231
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,940
Everyone...

232
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,610
That man...
What was that sudden gust?

233
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,990
He appeared and disappeared
like lighting on the same day

234
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,090
that Gold Roger was executed
22 years ago. What on earth...

235
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

236
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,710
If that's your decision, then go!

237
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,460
Why? Why did you
help that man... Dragon?!

238
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,590
What reason would there be to
interfere with a man's departure?

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,860
Set sail! We'll go after Straw Hat!

240
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,880
What?

241
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,280
We'll enter the Grand Line.

242
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,180
B-But, Captain! This island
is in your jurisdiction.

243
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,910
I don't know what
the higher-ups would say...

244
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,130
Tell them I said,
"Don't give me orders."

245
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll come with you!

246
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,870
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

247
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,100
I won't forgive Roronoa.

248
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,110
I'll capture him without fail!

249
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,200
Gee, that flashy gust was lucky for us.

250
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,820
We were able to escape like
this because I always behave well.

251
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,290
Where're we going now?

252
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,420
The Grand Line.

253
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,660
The Grand Line?

254
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,330
Yeah. This is a good opportunity. I have
to settle with that damn rubber man.

255
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,560
Let's head straight into
the nostalgic Grand Line...

256
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,230
Ugh! It's almost like
the ship's gonna tip over!

257
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,970
Look at that light!

258
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,870
Is that a lighthouse of the island?

259
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,940
It's a "guiding light." The entrance to
the Grand Line lies ahead of that light.

260
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,680
The Grand Line is ahead of that light...

261
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,890
What do you wanna do?

262
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,520
B-But there's no reason to
enter during a storm like this...

263
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,200
Okay, then!

264
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,580
Shall we hold a launching ceremony
for setting sail on the great ocean?

265
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,120
Hey!

266
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,040
Sure!

267
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,200
Let's do it!

268
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,390
In order to find the All Blue!

269
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,060
In order to be King of the Pirates!

270
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,540
In order to become
a master swordsman!

271
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,130
In order to draw a world map!

272
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,650
I-In order... to become
a brave warrior of the sea!

273
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,070
We're going... to the Grand Line!!

274
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,590
Yeah!

275
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

276
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

277
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

278
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

279
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

280
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

281
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

282
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

283
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

284
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

285
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

286
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,190
Hm? What's going on over there?
A flock of birds?

287
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,810
There must be fish under that.

288
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,300
Catch some, okay?

289
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,980
Leave it to me!

290
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,470
Hm? It's not fish!

291
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,580
It's a girl!

292
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,200
There's trouble! I see a Navy fleet!

293
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,020
D-Did they come to capture me?

294
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,320
Ahhh! They're firing at us!

295
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

296
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,990
"Precursor to a New Adventure!
Apis, a Mysterious Girl"

297
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,640
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
