00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,740
"How's Tricks? The Designs
of Zenny the Moneylender!"

20
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,360
Come on, come on, can't you work harder?!

21
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,270
You're not out strolling around, now!

22
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,180
Can't you put your back into it more?!

23
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,640
Old-timer, you just sit there,
quietly! We'll take care of this!

24
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,520
Here, now, Gramps, get some rest.

25
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,560
Would you like your shoulders rubbed?

26
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,400
W-What is this?

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,930
So, why are you
intentionally building this ship

28
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,860
up here in the mountains, old-timer?

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,450
Aah... it's because it's not a ship.

30
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,990
This isn't a ship?

31
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,410
Now, look! If this isn't a ship,
then exactly what is it?!

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,920
It is my... coffin.

33
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,860
Coffin?

34
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,550
Yeah. That means, this will be my grave.

35
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,180
I see. So this is your grave, old goat man.

36
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,890
Don't pray over it! You'll doom him!

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,680
It's still too early for this!

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,430
You're over-preparing!

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Could Gramps be aware
that his life is almost over?

40
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,400
What are you so startled at?

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,450
Living on an island like this,

42
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,610
it's not unusual that I would
make my own grave, is it?

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,740
I am going to die someday, after all.

44
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,010
Not just "someday," it's going to be really soon.

45
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,040
It's not unusual for a grave to
be up in the mountains, huh?

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,580
But why have your grave be a pirate ship?

47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,210
O-Old man!

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,130
W-Wait, old man!

49
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,550
C-Coffin, or g-grave, or whatever you call it,

50
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,140
it's almost finished!
Don't go jumping the gun!

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Don't die yet!

52
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,060
Shh... He's just sleeping.

53
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,150
So, you've found the
Straw Hat pirates, have you?

54
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,640
Yes, sir! I believe they have
landed on a deserted island,

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,110
as I reported earlier.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,990
All right, ready to attack at once!

57
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,700
"Justice"

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,010
We'll storm the island with all of our forces,

59
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,710
and bring down the Straw Hat pirates!
Every last one of them!

60
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,390
Please, wait, Captain!

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,370
In addition to those guys
with Devil Fruit abilities,

62
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,490
we'll be facing the master
swordsman, Roronoa Zoro.

63
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,930
So what if we are? Are you losing
your nerve, Sergeant Minchy?

64
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,390
Of course not. I just want to avoid
any unnecessary casualties.

65
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,020
Then what would you have us do?

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,130
If you do as I say, Captain,
then you will achieve

67
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,700
a complete victory with only a few casualties.

68
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,030
There.

69
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,700
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?

70
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,000
Yum! How did you make this cheese?

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,220
From the island goats' milk. It will
give you lots of energy, old-timer.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,970
Though at this point, it'll be
just a drop in the bucket.

73
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,280
Okay, Gramps, it's your turn.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,850
Let's see... There, checkmate. That's the game.

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,210
Wait a minute!

76
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,690
No waiting allowed, Nami-chan!

77
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,650
Y-You got me. In return, play me again?

78
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,600
All right. Nothing beats playing
chess against a beauty like you,

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,840
while getting my shoulders rubbed!

80
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,450
We took in a great catch today!

81
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,020
Sanji, make the old goat man
something yummy again, would you?

82
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,330
Yeah, I'm on it.

83
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,640
Old man, if there's anything else
you want to eat, or have us do,

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,720
don't be afraid to speak up, okay?
We'll do whatever we can!

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,620
Nah, I can die happy now.

86
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,470
I'm in paradise... paradise...

87
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,420
Don't say that!

88
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,950
Even if the way ahead is short...

89
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,460
...you've gotta live with a positive view!

90
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,820
For as long as you live!

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,230
Hey, doesn't it seem strange?

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
--What?
--The old man's only supposed
to have three days to live, right?

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
That's right. Three days.

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,070
Only three days to live.

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,420
That's just the briefest moment, isn't it?

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,460
Indeed it is. In just the briefest
moment, three days have gone by.

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,920
You're right.

98
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,600
So then, how is it that
he's still alive and kicking?

99
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,510
More than that, he's healthier
than he was before, isn't he?

100
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,550
More cheese.

101
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,010
Old-timer, here's today's medicine.

102
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,860
Make sure you take it.

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,440
I don't need that anymore. It makes
all the food taste bad, after all.

104
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,980
There, checkmate!

105
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,110
Not again!

106
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,670
I thought the old guy wasn't supposed to live

107
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,940
for more than three more days.

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,000
From the way he looks, he seems
good for another 30 years.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,410
You misdiagnosed him, huh?

110
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,940
No. That can't be right.

111
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,370
Still, if I did misdiagnose him,
that wouldn't be so bad, right?

112
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,370
That's not the issue here. If this is how it is,

113
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,210
then no matter what anyone else says,
I'm leaving the island.

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah. This is no place for me to be
forever kissing up to that old man.

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,180
I want to have some adventures at sea, too.

116
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,300
Then, that settles it.

117
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,850
Nami, we're setting sail!

118
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,770
C-Can you wait a little while longer?

119
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,730
How long are you gonna goof around?
Quit playing chess, already.

120
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,310
I can't quit playing! I've lost so many times,

121
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,080
I ended up pawning the ship to Gramps here.

122
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,070
What?!

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,530
What are pirates who have lost
their ship supposed to do?!

124
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,120
I'll get it back for sure, just wait!

125
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,800
Checkmate.

126
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,960
Stop, already!

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
Earthquake!

128
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,750
If you keep this up, there's no
telling what else will be signed away!

129
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,260
If you want your ship back,

130
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,460
you'll just have to work here on
the island for as much as it's worth.

131
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,720
By my reckoning, in total,
you'll have to work for ten years.

132
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,190
How's tricks with you?

133
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,190
--Nami-san!
--Nami!

134
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm sorry. I thought that if I got lucky,

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,150
I could get Gramps to tell
us where his treasure is.

136
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,310
Are you still going on about that?

137
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,000
At this point, we'll have to leave
the old man, and run away.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
--That's all there is to it.
--Not me.

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,850
What are you talking about, Luffy?

140
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,970
It's a good thing for us that
Zoro noticed it, or we might have

141
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,620
spent the rest of our lives on this
island working for that old man!

142
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,270
Would you figure it out, too?!

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,980
You can't have any adventures
around here, Luffy. Let's go.

144
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,050
--Nope.
--Luffy!

145
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,980
A stake is something like a promise, right?

146
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,160
If so, I don't want to break any promises.

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,270
This is no time to think about appearances!

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Zoro, what do you say?

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,940
The captain is the one to decide, right?

150
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,770
Luffy!

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,730
I said no, and I mean no.

152
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,110
Checkmate.

153
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,990
T-That's...

154
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,240
Looks like we can get the ship back, huh?

155
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,410
How about it, Gramps?

156
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,870
You got me...

157
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,470
Hooray!

158
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,250
We can always count on you, Big Sister!

159
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,330
How's tricks with you?

160
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,990
Just fine, thanks.

161
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,300
I've lived for many years,
but I've never seen pirates

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,430
as interesting as you are. I really like you.

163
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,180
Big party tonight!

164
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,900
Yeah, a feast, to celebrate
us getting the ship back!

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,190
Gramps, you're just like a great pirate.

166
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,020
You can really put it away.

167
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,130
Nami-chan, are you calling me a pirate?

168
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,670
If you weren't, you wouldn't have
such first-rate glasses, after all.

169
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,300
They are indeed treasure-class, huh?

170
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,380
Ah! Nami, you're trying
to get the old man drunk,

171
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,640
to find out where he keeps his treasure, huh?

172
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,390
Don't spell it out for him!

173
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,200
Old goat man, do you really have a treasure?

174
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,520
I just said, don't go talking so openly!

175
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,060
Some things do have their proper order!

176
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,960
My treasure...

177
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,350
...is what I have shared
my joys and sorrows with

178
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,410
ever since washing up on
this island-- the island goats.

179
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,200
What a great story!

180
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,410
Gotcha!

181
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,310
Don't just say "gotcha," tell us what you mean!

182
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,920
Okay, here's what it means.

183
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,020
For all the great pirates,
who traveled the Grand Line, I am...

184
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,710
I knew it!

185
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,550
...the moneylender who dealt with them.

186
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Moneylender?

187
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah. I'm Zenny the Moneylender,
not the Pirate!

188
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
You're not?

189
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,060
That's too bad, huh, Nami?

190
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,940
Still, you must have some nerve,
lending money to pirates,

191
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,560
don't you, old man?

192
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
Why's that?

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,050
Well, doesn't he? Do you think
pirates usually borrow money,

194
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,320
then pay it back? Not to mention the interest.

195
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,540
That's right. You can bet everyone
bilked me out of their debts.

196
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,020
Every damn one of those
pirates broke their word,

197
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,500
and betrayal was second nature to them.

198
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,210
So Gramps, it's true that you hate pirates, huh?

199
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
If I would've just sat back
and taken it from them,

200
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
my business would have been wiped out.

201
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,800
Every time I went out to collect on a debt,

202
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,360
I had to fight against pirates,

203
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,700
at the risk of my own life.

204
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,800
That's a business where you have to be

205
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,820
stronger than the pirates, isn't it?

206
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,410
Old goat man, were you that strong?

207
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,240
I don't mean to brag, but I was weak.
But then, I had a dream.

208
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
A dream?

209
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,140
You did, Gramps?

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,310
What?

211
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,900
Pay back the money?

212
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,350
I'm the man they call Zenny the Moneylender!

213
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,240
I'd rather see you in hell than
have you run out on your debt.

214
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,990
Shall we head to the underworld together?

215
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,890
W-Wait, Zenny! Here!

216
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,880
How's tricks? Well, goodbye.

217
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,250
Oh, no you don't! You give us pirates our due!

218
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,370
Oh, but I am.

219
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,260
Zenny! How dare you?!

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,620
Much obliged!

221
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,760
I may have been weak, but I had a dream,

222
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,770
so I fought desperately for it.
No, I managed to fight for it.

223
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,730
Old man, what was your dream?

224
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,020
Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a pirate.

225
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,150
A real pirate. The king of the pirates.

226
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,050
That's why I first started
in the moneylending trade.

227
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,230
But instead, I got hit with a sneak
attack by some damn pirates,

228
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,500
taking their anger out on me,

229
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
and I ended up being washed
ashore for dear life on this island.

230
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,840
That was 20 years ago now, was it?

231
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,210
Have you been making that grave for 20 years?

232
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,840
At first, I planned to build
the ship near the sea,

233
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,260
but bringing the lumber down from
the mountain was too much for me.

234
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,870
So, I didn't give up, no matter what,
but built it up in the mountains.

235
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,880
I had a hell of a dream I couldn't
calculate with my abacus.

236
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
A hell of an adventure!

237
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
But somewhere along the way,
my eyes were opened.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,420
Before I knew it, I was too old
to set sail for the Grand Line.

239
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,280
So much for my dream of being a pirate.

240
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,100
Dreams are just dreams, after all.

241
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,540
Why did you give up, old goat man?

242
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,620
Age doesn't have anything to do with it.

243
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,380
If you want to become a pirate,
then you should do it.

244
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,460
Hey, now, Luffy,

245
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,150
what are we going to do if the
old man takes you seriously?

246
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,340
--Pirates need a ship,
--Sanji, give me another.
--Coming up.

247
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,300
--and the old man's ship is
a coffin in the mountains.
--Thank you.

248
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,360
So we just have to bring it down, don't we?

249
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,100
Don't say it like it's so simple!

250
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,110
Yeah... there's still time...

251
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,570
There, you see? The old man
is taking you seriously!

252
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,470
No he's not. You're just drunk,
aren't you, Gramps?

253
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,510
Yeah, I'm drunk, I'm drunk!

254
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,950
Oh, he is?

255
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,790
This straw-hatted lad has got
me absolutely intoxicated!

256
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,530
All right! Here's looking forward to the day

257
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,240
when the Zenny Pirates set sail!

258
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,800
Can we really do this?

259
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,170
Lure the Straw Hat pirates off
the island, all by ourselves?

260
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,280
No matter how strong they might be,

261
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,220
they're still a bunch of greenhorn kids.

262
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,270
Depending on how this is done,
we have nothing to fear from them.

263
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,610
It's not as though I'm going
to fight them. Now, just watch.

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,940
Is the captain going to be able
to take the Straw Hat pirates?

265
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,710
That isn't any of my concern.

266
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,060
While the bigwigs are off fighting for justice,

267
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,160
we'll just be taking away the treasure.

268
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
Corporal, I'm going to put you to work, as well.

269
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
And I will reward you handsomely.

270
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,080
Y-Yes, sir.

271
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,700
Age doesn't have anything to do with it, huh?

272
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,110
He went and said something to
make an old man like me dream.

273
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,700
That straw-hatted lad is a nefarious boy.

274
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,310
--You're right.
--Robin-chan?

275
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,200
Our captain also rescues people
who want to die, without asking them,

276
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,610
and lets them live.

277
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,530
Are you glad he let you live?

278
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,490
Indeed... I'm not quite sure about that yet.

279
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,550
You're not sorry he did.

280
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,460
I can tell by your face. Robin-chan,
your life is just getting started.

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,260
But me... my dream will
remain at rest here, forever.

282
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,680
What's the matter?!

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,230
Bad news! Everyone, wake up!

284
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,030
I sure slept good. Time for breakfast?

285
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,110
The navy! The navy is here!

286
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,450
What?!

287
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,440
Just one ship?

288
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,290
They don't look like they're
about to attack, either.

289
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,580
What on earth is it doing here?

290
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Hey, Straw Hat pirates!

291
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,880
I am Sergeant Minchy,
of the navy. It's a pleasure.

292
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,280
A pleasure?

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Listen, I'm terribly sorry about the other day.

294
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,680
If we had known better
who we were dealing with,

295
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,990
we wouldn't have chased you around like that.

296
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,430
I hope you accept our apologies.

297
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,340
Strange, isn't it? It's only natural
for the navy to chase pirates.

298
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,860
He's being unusually hospitable.
Watch yourselves.

299
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,520
P-Please! Don't get upset!
I understand that you're the ones

300
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,510
who defeated Crocodile
back in Alabasta, aren't you?

301
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,570
I wouldn't think of fighting
against pirates as great as you are!

302
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,360
Believe me. I mean, if we meant to attack you,

303
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,410
would we come here with only one ship?

304
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,580
What do you know?
The guy is afraid of us, isn't he?

305
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,240
Even assuming we did risk
our lives to fight you,

306
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,420
it wouldn't earn us a single penny.

307
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,260
So, what are you doing here?

308
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,410
Oh, we're just here to investigate the island.

309
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,390
It's a newly discovered island
that doesn't appear on our maps.

310
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,600
Investigate? There's just an old
man and his island goats here.

311
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,480
Now that you mention it,
where did the old guy go?

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
I see. Then Zenny is being
safely cared for here, isn't he?

313
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,860
Zenny?

314
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,700
Once our survey is done, we're
planning to return to our base.

315
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,090
You'd best set sail on out
of here as soon as you can.

316
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,160
I wouldn't blame you.

317
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,000
Naval headquarters is in a frenzy
to eliminate you guys, after all.

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,470
So that's it. Sounds like
this is our chance, as well.

319
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll go get the food.
Have to call Robin down, too.

320
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,570
It's...

321
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,890
...a trap! A trap by the navy!

322
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,230
Are we setting sail, Luffy?

323
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,980
There's good weather past the fog.

324
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,310
The waves are gentle, and we won't,
by any means, lay a hand on you.

325
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,570
Come on, go ahead.

326
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,030
I go when I want to! You don't decide when!

327
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,630
If I were the navy, I'd fight
desperately against us,

328
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,620
even with only one ship!

329
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,890
Besides, something else is strange!

330
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,390
How did you know Gramps' name was Zenny?

331
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,210
We didn't say a word about it.

332
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,010
W-Well, you see...

333
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,310
I'm suspicious of what kind
of survey you plan to conduct.

334
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,350
You're not, by any chance,
after Gramps' treasure, are you?

335
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,390
That's it, huh? I don't trust this guy!

336
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,130
They've caught on, have they?

337
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,660
About the mountain of treasure
that Zenny the Moneylender

338
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,150
had signed over to him to
cover the pirates' debts?

339
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,650
I knew it! Gramps does have a treasure!

340
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,490
I smell gunpowder.

341
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,670
Is it that bastard's cannons?

342
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,120
It's not just one ship's cannons.

343
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,750
It's from more cannons than I can count.

344
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,140
What's that there?!

345
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,960
If we had set sail, we would have been caught

346
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,600
in a sneak attack by that fleet!

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,080
Mess with us, will they?!
I don't care if they are a fleet!

348
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,340
--Come and get me!
--W-Wait!

349
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,010
L-L-Luffy...!

350
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,970
Usopp!

351
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,900
Guys!

352
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,430
Don't move! One move, and this guy is dead!

353
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,230
They already had a landing
party hiding here, did they?!

354
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,440
Well done, Corporal!

355
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,360
Guys, hurry and let them know!

356
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,400
Wait. If they leave now,
they won't make it in time.

357
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,640
But what else can we do?

358
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,280
At this rate, the straw-hatted
lad and the others will be...

359
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,000
This is a mess.

360
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,440
What do we do?

361
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,350
Gramps, you're a pirate, right? Do something.

362
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,130
That's crazy! Maybe I am a pirate,
but this ship is my coffin.

363
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,090
It's up in the mountains,
and no matter what I do...

364
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,050
So we just have to bring it down, don't we?

365
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,510
The wind that blows down
from the mountains...!

366
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,900
Prepare to set sail!

367
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,610
What are you standing around for?!
Men, remove the chock planks!

368
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,650
Let's go!

369
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,370
Drop your weapons, or else!

370
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,530
--Usopp!
--Damn it!

371
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,480
Guys! Hurry and get out of here!

372
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,530
They're planning to finish us
all off, one way or another!

373
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,290
You keep your mouth shut!

374
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,130
Damn you, cowards!

375
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,600
We don't even have to wait
for the captain to land,

376
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,750
it's all over now. Corporal!

377
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,710
Sure enough...

378
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,960
You cowards!

379
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,750
I can handle bullets just fine.

380
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,760
But we can't handle them!

381
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,350
I'll take the treasure of Zenny,

382
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,940
along with the heads of the Straw Hat pirates!

383
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,190
It's time to send you to hell!

384
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,480
Sail on!

385
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,040
I-Impossible! A pirate ship,
coming out of the mountains?!

386
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,150
Attack of the Zenny Pirates!

387
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,960
Old man!

388
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,720
How's tricks?

389
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:17,600
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

390
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:27,810
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

391
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,540
There are days where I almost lose to myself

392
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:51,570
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

393
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,110
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

394
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:08,120
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

395
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:17,380
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

396
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,420
This unique moment...

397
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,090
Oh, nice going! I've gotta give him more credit!

398
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,630
--Is this any time for admiration?!
--Yeah!

399
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,970
It's not a good idea to show yourself,
when you're the one they're after!

400
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,970
Gramps, let me take care of the treasure!

401
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,010
Naughty girl...

402
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,060
If something is dear to you,
fight to protect it, old man!

403
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

404
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,650
"Whereabouts of the Island Treasure!
Attack of the Zenny Pirates!"

405
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
