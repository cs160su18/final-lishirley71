2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,010
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,230
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,420
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,370
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,520
He out-negatived the Negative Ghosts!

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,860
Listen... When it comes to thinking negatively...

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,980
...I'll have you know I'm unbeatable!

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,700
Wow! He's super confident in a bad way!

51
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,780
Playtime is over, Special Zombie Oars.

52
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,290
Chop him down from the legs!

53
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,710
Where's Oars?

54
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,500
There he is! Look up!

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,090
Gum-Gum...

56
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,000
...Gatling!

57
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,150
Nami-san!

58
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,610
I came for you!

59
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,360
There she is!

60
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,330
"Blazing Knight Sanji!!
Kick Down the Fake Wedding!"

61
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,870
You're going to kick my butt?

62
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,800
Yeah, you heard me!

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,060
Even if you managed to throttle or kill me,

64
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,420
it would simply mean the zombies
would no longer be my servants.

65
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,020
It wouldn't bring your shadow back.

66
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,600
It wouldn't?

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,470
Nope. My ability allows me
to reign over shadows.

68
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,940
This is what you'll have to do
to realize your dream:

69
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,360
Make the person currently
reigning over the shadows--me--

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,800
order the shadows to return to their masters.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,230
Then they'll return to everyone?

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,750
Yep! Isn't it simple?

73
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,050
You'd need to hurt me badly enough
that I'd be willing to comply.

74
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,760
But considering your level of strength,
you couldn't even lay a hand on me!

75
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,140
All righty!

76
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,310
Gum-Gum...

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,900
...Pistol!

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,230
Wha--?!

79
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,490
A shadow?

80
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,790
I dare you to defeat my clone, Doppelman!

81
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,410
Long ago, I was brimming with
overconfidence and arrogance.

82
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,720
But it didn't take long for me to learn how
important it is to have good subordinates.

83
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,750
What's with that guy?

84
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,100
Hey! Outta the way!

85
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,940
I am the man who will become the
King of the Pirates without lifting a finger.

86
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,900
I will use the strength of others to get there!

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,940
I'm the one who will
become King of the Pirates!

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,950
Your zombie said the exact same thing.

89
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,950
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

90
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,880
As you can imagine, when its new
body is nothing like the original,

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,440
the shadow retains even more
of its original master's personality.

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,930
But that doesn't last forever!

93
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,350
Eventually, it will forget
everything pertaining to you.

94
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,930
It will become a zombie
that is completely loyal to me!

95
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,020
No matter how strong a zombie's will might be,

96
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,480
it will ultimately serve me unconditionally!

97
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,610
I'm getting it back in just a sec!

98
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,450
Gum-Gum...

99
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,040
Brick Bat.

100
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,540
...Gatling!

101
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,330
Damn it! He's blocking all of my punches.

102
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,800
Ow, ow!

103
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,010
Ow, ow, ow!

104
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,940
Ow, ow, ow!

106
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,060
You're a rowdy brat.

107
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,960
Shut up!

108
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,080
You jerk!

109
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,810
Kick his butt! Trample him!

110
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,340
But watch out for his salt!

111
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,940
Crap! I'm the only one who can
stand up to the Horo-Horo Chick!

112
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,350
This was supposed to be
my time to shine, darn it!

113
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,400
All of the other pirates quickly
succumbed to my Negative Ghosts...!

114
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,340
Mackerel... I'm worse than mackerel...

115
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,590
Yeah! I want a feral dog to step on me!

116
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm sorry for walking on the same earth...

117
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
...as everyone else!

118
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,640
I never expected one of the men to be immune!

119
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,440
I've always been negative!

120
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,400
What?!

121
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,120
But that's all right. I'll just have
the Wild Zombies kill Mr. Long Nose.

122
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,780
Drat! I can't use my Salt Stars like this!

123
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,250
How am I supposed to pull out of this? How?!

124
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,050
That's it!

125
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,210
Okay!

126
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,470
Y-You got me! Ugh!

127
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,110
Sweet! We killed him!

128
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,840
Stupid! Keep your hands over your mouth!

129
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,680
It might be another one of his tricks!

130
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,640
Oh, you're right! He's fumbling
around with something.

131
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,980
Hmph! You're wasting your time!

132
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,680
Salt!

133
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,940
How are you going to get
the salt in our mouths?

134
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,360
Star! Star! Star!

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,230
Just kidding.

136
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,110
Pepper Star!

137
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,750
Here's my chance! Eat this!

138
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,290
Salt Star!

139
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,110
Mr. Negative Nose, you weasel!

140
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm not done yet!

141
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,760
When it comes to tricking people, I'm--

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,080
Shuddup! Drop the cool act!

143
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,870
You're a loser!

144
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,430
Charge!

145
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,350
I'll stop you in your tracks! Firebird Star!

146
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,260
You missed!

147
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,770
What a klutz!

148
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,690
Sh-Shoot!

149
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,360
Get him!

150
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,700
What?!

151
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,710
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

152
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,090
It's rottin' hot!

153
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,090
Hey, you guys!

154
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,850
Now! Special Attack!

155
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,430
--No!
--Out of my way!

156
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,100
If you don't move, I'll start with--hey, wait!

157
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,320
He's nuts! I can't let my guard
down for a second around him.

158
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,830
I need to come up with a way
to defeat Negative Nose!

159
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,700
I won't let you escape!

160
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,660
Wait, Horo-Horo Chick!

161
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,080
Stop him, Kumacy!

162
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,460
The bear zombie?!

163
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,280
Wait!

164
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,340
Don't follow me!

165
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,290
Wait, Horo-Horo Chick!

166
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,840
Don't follow me!

167
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,340
Don't mess with Perona-sama!

168
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,460
I had no idea that stuffed animal
was so nimble and powerful!

169
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,820
And here he can't even reach
the zipper on his back!

170
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,780
Why, you...!

171
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,410
I'm sorry if I upset you!

172
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,540
Whoops! I wanna go this way!

173
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Yikes! Stay away!

174
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,840
--Huh?
--Stay back, darn it!

175
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,040
Gah! Don't follow me, bear!
I said to stay back, bear!

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,790
Keep back, dammit!

177
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,480
You bastard! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

178
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
Wait, you...!

179
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,220
Stay back! Stay away, dammit!

180
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,780
I'm not about to lose!
Wait, wait, wait! You little--!

181
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,650
Huh? Where'd you go?
Huh? Are you over here?

182
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,990
Now I'm mad!

183
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,670
No way!

184
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,010
Stay away!

185
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,040
Keep back, Mr. Negative Nose!

186
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,110
Don't come after me, bear!

187
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,670
Graah!

188
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,910
Let's see...

189
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,260
Yeah!

190
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,450
Nice! I'm starting to get really excited!

191
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,930
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

192
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,370
Skip! Skip! Skip!

193
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,120
Nami-san!

194
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,410
Get your grubby hands off her!

195
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,180
Sorry to have kept you waiting,
Nami-san. Your knight is here.

196
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,070
Shake! Shake your hands!

197
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:39,080
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

198
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,520
One, two...

199
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,340
Shake your hands!

200
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,270
Man, I feel like I haven't gone
swimming in ages. I wonder why...

201
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,910
Do I sink like a rock?

202
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,300
I can't remember!

203
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,470
Well, it's all good!

204
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,280
Ho-hoy!

205
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,540
I never expected this!

206
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,540
I'm drowning!

207
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,580
That was rather rash of you.

208
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,730
What if you had swallowed the salt water?

209
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,680
You could handle a little,

210
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,270
but if you drank a lot,
the salt would purify you.

211
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,580
Man, I thought I was gonna die!

212
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,330
Really! You can be such a handful.

213
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,280
Leave me alone!

214
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,170
Nami-san, you're in safe hands--

215
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,340
M-My word! Is she a goddess?

216
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,120
Uh, no. It's Nami-san. It really is Nami-san.

217
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,680
I'm sure of it!

218
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,780
Oh, I was so surprised.

219
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,160
Her beauty can be deceptive!

220
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,570
For a second, I thought I recued
a goddess by mistake. Phew!

221
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,860
A-A fairy?

222
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh, I was so surprised.
But this is definitely Nami-san.

223
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,370
Ah, what a relief.

224
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,690
--I thought I accidentally rescued a fairy
by mistake. You're a deceptive little kitten.
--Sheesh! What are you going on about?

225
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,220
As I recall, you're part of the crew
that was on that pirate ship.

226
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,890
A-An angel?

227
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,670
N-No, she's human. I'm sure of it.

228
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Ah, she had me scared there!

229
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,770
I don't blame you! I really don't blame you!

230
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,110
Nami-san and rice are about the only
things that look this good in white!

231
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,550
Yeah, seriously!

232
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,740
I know, right? You get it, right?

233
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,930
Why must she look so stinking good in white?!

234
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,460
--What are they going on about?
--It throws me off.

235
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,660
Lowly pirate! I don't need
to be chums with you!

236
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,980
Hey!

237
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,090
You nearly hit Nami-san.

238
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,220
When a lady is in the vicinity,
you should avoid attacks that could hit her.

239
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,930
I'm impressed you dodged that, bastard!

240
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,890
I see you've already lost your shadow.

241
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,860
Come to think of it, one of our new zombies
was oddly obsessed with that woman.

242
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,240
He retained some will of his own,
so he wasn't fully subservient.

243
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,200
I won't let you pursue that lady!

244
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,880
I suspect that was your zombie.

245
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,290
Considering that your shadow
wasn't put into a General Zombie,

246
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,040
your fighting ability
can't be all that impressive.

247
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,880
In fact, that penguin talked big,
but was terribly weak!

248
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm known as one of the Phantoms
and lead the General Zombies.

249
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,840
It was impudent of that small fry to defy me!

250
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,190
A-A heavenly maiden?!

251
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,420
Oh, I was so surprised.

252
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,670
I thought she was a heavenly maiden. Sheesh!

253
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,810
Listen to me, punk!

254
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,970
She's definitely Nami-san. No mistake about it.

255
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,690
I wasn't sure what I'd do
if she was a divine maiden.

256
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,890
Don't heave a sigh of relief!

257
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,110
You know, it doesn't matter how
obsessed you are with that woman!

258
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,950
I am going to marry her!

259
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,010
Now take a word of advice
and leave that woman with me

260
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,130
while you spend the rest of
your life hiding in the shadows!

261
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm rather busy at the moment!

262
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,270
Your captain's zombie may have crushed
some of my most powerful subordinates.

263
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,930
Before I deal with that, I need to kiss my bride!

264
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,970
I'm sure you understand.
I'm in a foul mood right now.

265
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,650
I don't have time to deal with weaklings like--

266
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,860
Shut up, Fur Face!

267
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,170
Absalom-sama!

268
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,650
No way! He weighs 300kg!
How did that man send him flying?!

269
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,670
You're the "invisible man"
Usopp mentioned, aren't you?

270
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,080
What was with that kick?

271
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,030
He sent me flying even though
Hogback has transplanted

272
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,480
the power of wild animals into my body!

273
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,640
Hands of the Dead!

274
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,400
What's going on? Could he
tell what I was about to do?

275
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,730
Basses Côte!

276
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,820
Longe!

277
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,950
You're the beast that showed up on Sunny
and licked Robin-chan, aren't you?!

278
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,320
Something has caught me!

279
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,500
And you ogled at Nami-san's
bare skin in the bath, didn't you?!

280
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,830
Be my blushing bride!

281
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,760
Tendron! Flanchet! Quasi!

282
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,510
Why is he so strong?! This is their small fry?!

283
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,180
Queue! Cuisseau! Jarret!

284
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,930
Why is she unconscious?! You didn't
get rough with her, did you?!

285
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,720
"Marriage," my ass!
Take a good look at my eyes.

286
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,900
I'll crush you under my feet
and turn you into croquette!

287
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,440
Damn it! I'll have to retreat for now.

288
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,860
Skating!

289
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,820
I've got Usopp's salt balls.

290
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,450
Over there!

291
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,540
What is that? It's salty!

292
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,540
Veau Shot!

293
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,970
Insane! This guy doesn't even have a bounty?

294
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,990
You said that you were in a foul mood?

295
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,940
That doesn't begin to describe mine.

296
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,520
I'm so mad I feel like my body could explode!

297
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,480
It did!

298
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:19,060
And unfortunately for you, there is bad
blood between us over one other thing!

299
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,850
You and I have some bad blood?

300
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,980
That's right! You... You...!

301
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,370
Nothing comes to mind.

302
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,060
I just met you for the first time today.

303
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,060
You stole one of my dreams!

304
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

305
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,690
"A Clear-Clear History? Sanji's Stolen Dream"

306
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,080
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
