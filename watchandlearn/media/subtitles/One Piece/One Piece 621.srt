00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,570
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,610
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,770
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,440
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,610

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,580
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,320
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,350
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,000
and landed on Punk Hazard;

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,140
an island with two parts, one burning, the other frozen.

81
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,530
They learned about the ruler of the island
and the puppet master

82
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,340
of Shinokuni - Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,000
and along with their pirate
ally - the Warlord -

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,790
Trafalgar Law, were drawn
into a climactic battle

85
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,480
which ended with Caesar's defeat.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,310
However...

87
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,180
Goodbye, Young Master.

88
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,000
I know you will become...

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,460
...the King of the Pirates.

90
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,020
Goodbye, Smoker!

91
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,010
What happened, Monet?

92
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,680
Young Master...

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,970
Weapon-morphosis!

94
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,230
Revolver Girl!

95
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,070
Oh! It doesn't work!

96
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,870
It just made me itchy!

97
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,180
Alright, we're almost there!

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,260
Go faster!

99
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,350
Is it still safe there?

100
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,660
Which means the island and those squirts
haven't been wiped out.

101
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,410
You two.

102
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,840
Take care of that guard.

103
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm on my way!

104
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,450
"Capture Caesar!
General Cannon Blasts!"

105
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,170
THE SEACOAST OF PUNK HAZARD

106
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,420
Now, with that much
ordinance, he must be...

107
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,650
What?!

108
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:14,920
I am an invincible Iron Pirate!

109
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,960
Super!

110
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,350
Even a Pacifista would
take damage from that!

111
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,370
What is that bastard?!
Why does he stand in our way?!

112
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,110
Because you guys are
trying to steal my cola!

113
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,860
Cola?! What is he talking about?!

114
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,230
Cola is my energy source!

115
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,880
So what?!

116
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,270
What's wrong, Weapon Woman?
Aren't you gonna transform?

117
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,790
I liked those looks on you!

118
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,160
Then I'll show you!

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,840
Weapon-morphosis!

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,190
Flying Disc Girl!

121
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,890
Here we go-dasuyan!

122
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,140
That's nothing!

123
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,850
Weapon-morphosis!

124
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh? What is it this time?

125
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,060
Fire Girl!

126
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,930
I'm gonna finish you off
with this one-dasuyan!

127
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,570
Oh! Ouch! Ow, ow... Ouch! Ow, ow, ow...

128
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,500
Burn up-dasuyan!

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,490
Fire Girl's "flame of love" burns any enemy -
it's the most...

130
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,190
Just kidding!

131
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,260
General I'm-Okay!

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,700
What?!

133
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,400
N-No way!

134
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,770
Come on, Fan Man and Weapon Woman!

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,880
The tunnel is gonna collapse!

136
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,420
Don't collapse before
we get to the exit!

137
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,120
Even if we can make it out,
there's the gas to deal with!

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,020
Hey girl, can you really generate wind?!

139
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,660
Are we gonna be okay?

140
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,190
Hey, hey!

141
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,320
Those of you who don't
trust Nami-san, get off!

142
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,270
No, I'm gonna kick you out!

143
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,150
You're scaring us, brother.

144
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,140
We'll be counting on you, Nami!

145
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,440
You're our only hope now!

146
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,410
Trust me!

147
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,890
What is that iron soldier?!
Nothing works on him!

148
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,790
I can't let you have my cola!

149
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,930
I said we're not
interested in your cola!

150
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,080
He's keeping us too long!
We got to take care of him already!

151
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,020
Let's do it, Baby 5!

152
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,710
No one's ever warded off
this attack of ours!

153
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,130
No matter what you try,

154
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,050
super nothing will work!

155
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,620
We're gonna chop up your body!

156
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,580
Weapon-morphosis!

157
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,370
Feast your eyes on this
weapon that I'm swinging...

158
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,620
Sickle Girl!

159
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,540
Okay, I praise you...

160
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,420
...for your power - you made
it through this General body!

161
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,070
But this is like a mantis
going up against a warship!

162
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,060
The Thousand Sunny will
conquer the whole sea someday.

163
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,920
And I'm gonna give you a taste of

164
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,050
its ultimate secret weapon although
you guys don't deserve to see it!

165
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,290
This is a land-based
version of Gaon Cannon!

166
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,300
I call it...

167
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,620
General Cannon!

168
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,620
Who is he-dasuyan?!

169
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,060
Why is he preventing us
from recovering Caesar?!

170
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,170
Pops! Hold my hand! Hurry!

171
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,830
Isn't that Caesar who's lying there?

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,530
How did he get there?

173
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,710
We can't fail!
No matter who you're working for!

174
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,350
Whoa-whoa, I can't believe it!
They are so tough.

175
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,220
Don't think that we're
just ordinary underdogs.

176
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,520
In the name of Joker...

177
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,360
...We're gonna recover Caesar
no matter what it takes!

178
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,230
So what you're trying to do is...

179
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,030
recover Caesar over there, isn't it?

180
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,240
Go, truck!

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,140
We're almost there!

182
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,100
Alright, we can make it...

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,980
What?

184
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,280
Look! The deadly gas is
everywhere at the exit!

185
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,450
N-No!

186
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,590
The gas is coming from
both front and back!

187
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,940
We have no choice but go through that!

188
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,130
Sis, save us! Please!

189
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,200
Please!

190
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
Get us out of here!

191
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,320
Sis, please! Help us!

192
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,430
You can't turn your back
on a child crying for help!

193
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,130
I'll keep my word at any cost!

194
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,480
Let's go!

195
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,120
Sorcery Climate Baton!

196
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,300
Gust Sword!

197
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,520
Let's get out!

198
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,090
Keep the wind going, Nami!

199
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,890
The gas will be everywhere outside, too!

200
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,150
I'll accomplish the mission
from Joker at any price!

201
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,930
Although I'll kill him when I get back!

202
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,590
You iron soldier!

203
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,740
We won't let you mess
with us anymore-dasuyan!

204
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,150
We made it out!

205
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,080
What?!

206
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,690
Yeah!

207
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,440
Oh? Why isn't the gas here?

208
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,510
You've made it here finally!
I was getting tired of waiting!

209
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,780
Wow! Look at that!

210
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,120
It's the General!

211
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,190
What?

212
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,960
Super!

213
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,780
--It's a robot!
--The ultimate one!

214
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,400
--Wow! Cool!
--That's what we boys love!

215
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,540
Yeah, isn't it?!

216
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,530
Buffalo!

217
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,010
Are you Baby 5?!

218
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,360
Law! Are you really going
to stand against Joker?!

219
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,640
You traitor!

220
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,780
Joker is still saving the
"heart seat" for you!

221
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,760
Who are they? Are they your friends?

222
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,730
No.

223
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,830
They're my enemies!

224
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,580
All of the Straw Hats and the Navy G-5!
Odds are against us!

225
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,520
Wh-What's going on, Baby 5?

226
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,820
In any case, we gotta take
Caesar to the Young Master!

227
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,540
They took Caesar and ran!

228
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,240
Alright, I got it!

229
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,500
It's a sniper's work to
take down a flying enemy!

230
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,000
--Those bastards!
--Whoa-whoa!

231
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,770
Usopp said he can handle it.

232
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,280
Don't underestimate our sniper.

233
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,910
Even his nose is too long.

234
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,140
The last part isn't necessary!

235
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,430
No way! If we let them get away,
our plan is...

236
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,680
You allied with us, didn't you?

237
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,320
You saw what I did earlier.
I need you to trust us a little bit.

238
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,760
Allied? What are you talking about?

239
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,370
I've been running around
all this time so...

240
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,060
...I feel like attacking now!

241
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,880
I'm not afraid of enemies
who are far away

242
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,200
and have no intention to fight!

243
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,840
On top of that, they're wounded
and turning their backs on us!

244
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,480
Alright! Let's just do it!

245
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,530
Now I give you some water.

246
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,680
Okay, let's do it!

247
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,450
Grow Up!

248
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,030
Chomping Grass on Black Kabuto!

249
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,240
Now, eat up and get your fill!

250
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,750
Be careful, Buffalo!
They're up to something!

251
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,520
You have to watch my back, Baby 5!
Neither of you can fly so I have to!

252
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,920
Let's complete the mission!

253
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,420
What?!

254
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,290
Okay! You need me, don't you?

255
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,260
I'll defend you with my life!

256
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,910
Go! Weather Egg!

257
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,230
Something's flying this way!

258
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,770
Now, hatch! Thunder-chan!

259
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,220
Thundercloud?!

260
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,690
Buffalo! I have a bad feeling!

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,030
I can't go any faster than this!

262
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,300
No, you can't get away!

263
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,300
The Science of Weather!

264
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,670
Thunder Breed...

265
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,650
No!

266
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,280
...Tempo!

267
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,250
Baby 5! Damn, she got hit!

268
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,870
Here is a final blow!
Go, Chomping Grass!

269
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,610
Special Attack - Charging Shooting Star!

270
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,590
Go!

271
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,070
H-Hey, Buffalo! You got to protect me.

272
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,720
I can't move myself!

273
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,070
O-Of course! Don't underestimate me.

274
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,930
I'm a member of Don Quixote's family!

275
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,220
I'll complete a mission at any cost!

276
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,270
Idiot! What a good-for-nothing!

277
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,740
You can't hit me, fool! I'm a gas man!

278
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,820
I-I must make it to Dressrosa
with or without them!

279
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,180
You can't run! The last ammo is...

280
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,940
Wh-What is this?!

281
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

282
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,850
Alright, I caught him!

283
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,090
That serves you right, Caesar!

284
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,780
You can count on me
when an enemy turns his back...

285
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,410
Alright!

286
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,330
All right. the initial
phase is accomplished.

287
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,000
See? They are strong, aren't they?

288
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,570
Wait for me!

289
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,620
Squirts!

290
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,000
I overslept.

291
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,570
Which way is Punk Hazard?
