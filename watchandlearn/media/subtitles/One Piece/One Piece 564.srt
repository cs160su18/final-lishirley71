00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,420
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,070
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,770
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,910
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,370
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,870
The Straw Hats find themselves caught up in
the turmoil and involved in an all-out war.

80
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,880
Now, Hordy's merciless plot puts the
Fish-Man Island in unprecedented danger!

81
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,600
The giant ship, Noah, has just lost its power

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,560
and is starting to fall
towards the island again!

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,980
What?!

84
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,070
About Hordy Jones...

85
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,690
I found out who he really is!

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,450
Hordy is...

87
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,620
...a monster who was brought
to life by our environment!

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,910
The New Fish-Man Pirates are a group of
monsters created from an ancient grudge!

89
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,850
What did you go through in the past?!

90
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,590
Answer me, Hordy!

91
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,260
What did humans do to you?!

92
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,100
Nothing.

93
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,880
We were chosen by heaven to punish humans...

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
...and granted powers!

95
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,540
Their hatred is...

96
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,620
...not rooted in their
experience or true beliefs.

97
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,330
They have no substance!

98
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,340
They are completely "empty"!

99
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,310
"Back to Zero! Earnest Wishes for Luffy!"

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,190
Their hatred is not rooted in
their experience or true beliefs.

101
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,800
They have no substance! They
are completely "empty"!

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,570
Empty? What does he mean by that?

103
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,520
Hey, you guys, you got to keep
moving! Get off of the island!

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,000
You can see the shadow of the
Noah up in the sky already!

105
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,470
--Hurry up! It's gonna come within range soon!
--I'm hurrying!

106
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,060
How much longer? How much
inflation do we have so far?!

107
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,920
87%!

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,480
Make it in time! Make it!

109
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,870
Hurry up, Yowahoshi!

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,080
Hordy-sama looks even more
terrifying than before!

111
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,960
Humans are lowly creatures.

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,650
Remember, Hordy.

113
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,260
They are evil.

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,920
This is it! We're doomed!

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,630
Since the Pirate Era began, we've kept
losing our friends day after day!

116
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,680
Humans have kidnapped some young Mermaids

117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,960
and sold them to the Human Shoppe!

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,090
We're all doomed! The
Fish-Man Island will fall!

119
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,800
--Damn humans!
--We have to kill them all!

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

121
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,880
Damn! Humans!

122
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,780
They get on my nerves!

123
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,830
Oh, you got stronger-ch!

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,660
Wow!

125
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,670
It's great! We have a hero!

126
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,920
He blew up the Human Shoppe sacrificing
his life! Pay him your respects!

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,420
Let's not forget his death!

128
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,480
Hero?

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
That serves you right, humans!

130
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,440
This is awesome!

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,500
Yeah.

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,800
Heroes are cool-ch!

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,750
Dosun!

134
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,210
Arlong-san sank another human pirate ship!

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,200
This is a crusade!

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,220
Ages ago, the filth we call "humans"
envied the chosen and gifted Fish-Men

137
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,730
and feared our existence.

138
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,940
And...

139
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,190
...they decided to persecute us.

140
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,430
Humans were everywhere in
the world, like maggots.

141
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,160
So they exploited their only
advantage - their number,

142
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
and drove us down to the seafloor.

143
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,460
Listen, everyone! Never forget
our grudge against the humans!

144
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,050
Humans know and fear that
their reckoning day will come!

145
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,470
And that's when we'll make them pay!

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,230
Never forget our history.

147
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,980
Feel the disappointment of the dead.

148
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,450
Take over their resentment.

149
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,500
Hold a grudge against humans!

150
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,880
There is this human named Rayleigh
who I knew for a long time

151
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,580
and he's different!

152
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,890
He doesn't make a face
even when he sees me...

153
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,670
Hordy?

154
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,490
I don't like your story, Hachi-san.

155
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,170
It makes me sick.

156
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,320
Humans are afraid.

157
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
Take over the resentment. Okay, Hordy?

158
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,180
Remember, Hordy.

159
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,230
They are evil, lowly creatures.

160
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,270
Hate humans.

161
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,910
Hate them. Hate them! Hate them!!

162
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,140
This is terrible!

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,850
Tiger-san, the hero who freed the
slaves, has been killed by humans!

164
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,040
What?!

165
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,880
So Tiger was not the chosen hero.

166
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,700
Who are you people?! Go away!

167
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,900
I heard you gave your blood to humans.

168
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,740
So what?! There was a
human who was dying so...

169
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,540
Dad!

170
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,850
Even the members of the royal
family are crazy in this country.

171
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,650
She wants to forgive humans.

172
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,860
Screw that!

173
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,480
Did you hear about Jimbei-san
joining the Seven Warlords?

174
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,000
Only the Arlong Pirates keep
the purity of the Fish-Men.

175
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,290
We need a hero.

176
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,130
This country...

177
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,970
...needs a hero.

178
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,810
Otohime-sama has been shot!

179
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,750
You see? That's what humans do!

180
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,800
They show no mercy even to someone like

181
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,970
the Queen who was so friendly to them!

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,200
If the royal family won't
seek revenge out of pride,

183
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,720
we'll never trust this country again!

184
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,910
We don't need such a spineless country!

185
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,920
The leader of those disgraceful
ones has been punished by heaven!

186
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,340
Those villains who want to
forgive humans must die-dosun!

187
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,690
It's time for our revenge!

188
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,730
Heaven chose us finally and granted us power.

189
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,250
--Don't tell me it's...
--That legendary drug-ch?!

190
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,290
I can't believe you got it-dosun!

191
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,880
Can you make a lot of it, Zeo?

192
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,210
I'll try.

193
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,520
The people of the Fish-Man District who are

194
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,210
disappointed with the
country will come together!

195
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,410
This is a crusade! Get ready!

196
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,890
Prepare to kill as many humans
as you can until your own death!

197
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,390
We were chosen...

198
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,560
...to inherit the duty of vengeance!

199
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,480
The reckoning day will come!

200
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,070
Evil lowly creatures - humans!

201
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,750
We're devoting our life to this vengeance!

202
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,270
It was too late!

203
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,230
I don't know when but we lost
contact with the Fish-Man District

204
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,600
and they've become something like an
isolated, dark side of the Fish-Man Island!

205
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:49,330
We pretended not to see the twisted hatred
building up in that lawless ditch...

206
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,840
...in the deep water!

207
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,970
--Hey you! Where are you going?!
--Let me go! The Noah is...

208
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,790
No way!

209
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,270
I filled my mother's shoes
and collected signatures

210
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,650
but I was only dealing
with superficial matters.

211
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,840
But I thought I was making a progress!

212
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,630
I know it's hard but...

213
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,720
...you can't plant your anger and resentment

214
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,510
toward humans in children's minds!

215
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,700
It was too late!

216
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,190
People like them are the ones
that my mother feared the most!

217
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,900
Brother-sama!

218
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,150
We should have fought within ourselves first!

219
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,530
We should have fought our
own feelings toward humans!

220
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,730
Mother was...

221
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,510
Mother was killed by the grudge
growing on the Fish-Man Island!

222
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,810
It was too late! People like them are...

223
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,530
...the ones that my mother feared the most!

224
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,360
We should have fought within ourselves first!

225
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:17,780
We should have fought our
own feelings toward humans!

226
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,490
Mother was...

227
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,210
Mother was killed by the grudge
growing on the Fish-Man Island!

228
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,550
Maybe she knew it!

229
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,610
So it doesn't matter who did this...

230
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,470
Don't get angry on my behalf.

231
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,690
Don't let resentment or hatred get
the better of you for my sake.

232
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,440
But a part of me held that resentment

233
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,860
and hated humans for killing my mother!

234
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,240
Prince...

235
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,830
Dead people take their regret to the grave.

236
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,630
So a grudge is an illusion that the living
create and they alone cultivate it!

237
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,360
Because I hated humans - even
a bit, I overlooked the

238
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,430
resentment in the Fish-Man District

239
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,470
and when I finally noticed, it had
become too powerful and beyond control!

240
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,610
If nothing is done, the
Fish-Man Island will...

241
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,650
...destroy itself through its
own hatred toward humans!

242
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,910
Be careful!

243
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,910
Unlike the bubble protecting the
island, this one can overshoot the ship!

244
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,890
It has to surround the
Noah! It can't go too far!

245
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,040
Straw Hat! Please!

246
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,930
We don't need the past!
Reset our history to zero!

247
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,350
Wipe out those phantoms who shut
the island away from the sun!

248
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,060
Okay, now!

249
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,990
Go!

250
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,450
Bring the Fish-Man Island back...

251
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,540
...to zero!

252
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,000
Shut up, Fukaboshi!

253
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,270
The Fish-Men's grudge will last forever!

254
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,390
Brother-hoshi.

255
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,270
As long as you let me handle
it my way, don't worry.

256
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,870
H-Hey! Those guys fighting against
Hordy's crew at the plaza are...

257
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,280
--Yes, it's the Straw Hats!
--And Boss Jimbei!

258
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,030
What?!

259
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,280
--Luffy-chan's voice!
--Oh yeah!

260
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,970
Yes! It's in the bubble!

261
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,080
Our minds were made up when
we arrived at the plaza that,

262
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,510
along with Jimbei, we wouldn't
let anyone harm the island!

263
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,020
Leave it all up to us, Brother-hoshi!

264
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,820
We're friends, right?

265
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,100
I cannot believe we suspected
a human like him!

266
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,120
Hey, what's wrong? Don't stop!

267
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,400
We have to run! Hey!

268
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,330
--I'm gonna stay on the island!
--What?!

269
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,390
Me too!

270
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,820
--Me too!
--I'm not gonna run either!

271
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,920
Me too!

272
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,630
--Luffy-sama! There is air on the Noah now!
--Yeah!

273
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,760
You can't get away from me!

274
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,300
Hordy-sama!

275
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,030
Yowahoshi! Stay with me! I
promise I won't let you be hurt!

276
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,890
Okay!

277
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,570
Straw Hat!

278
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,490
Luffy-sama!

279
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,540
Take this! The Wings of Ikaros!

280
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,090
Wings?

281
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,590
That's not tsubasa (wings).

282
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,440
That's tsuba (spit)!

283
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,760
Squid!

284
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,270
Ink?

285
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,620
It's too bad for you-ch!

286
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,820
That was my alter ego made from squid ink!

287
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,900
Don't underestimate us officers of...

288
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,860
Franky Fireball!

289
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,620
Oh, I don't wanna become a dried squid-ch!

290
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,140
Yes! General Franky's new attack!

291
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,500
He shot a fireball from his stomach!

292
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,420
Huh?

293
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,380
You breathed it?!

294
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,880
How could you drop your guard-gaban?!

295
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,550
Weight Boost!

296
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,720
T-shot!

297
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,510
Heavy Gong!

298
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,600
He stopped my hammer with his bare hand?!

299
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,260
Ow... Maybe this transformation is not
suited for a fight against a hammer!

300
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,560
Hey, Chopper!

301
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,550
That was the form that gave you the most

302
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,460
human-like look but now
you look like a monster!

303
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,550
I don't care now.

304
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,700
I wanted to look like a human
because I wanted friends.

305
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,410
Now I wanna become a monster
who is helpful to Luffy!

306
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,680
I see.

307
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,130
Smiles make me wanna slice!

308
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,510
Bring the strongest swordsman
on the Fish-Man Island!

309
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,020
You're not even able to kill my boredom.

310
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,360
Straw Hat!

311
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,920
It's all over now!

312
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,140
Weren't you listening?

313
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,090
I won't let anyone harm the Fish-Man Island!

314
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,570
It's finally time...

315
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,210
...for the climax of the Straw
Hats' battle in Conchcorde Plaza.

316
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,930
And on the Noah, Hordy, transformed
into a living weapon...

317
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,390
...mercilessly attacks Luffy.

318
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,870
In order to fulfill his
promise to Fukaboshi...

319
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,640
...Luffy puts everything he's got into
his fists in order to crush Hordy!

320
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
On the next episode of One Piece!

321
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,480
"Luffy's All-out Attack! Red Hawk Blasts!"
