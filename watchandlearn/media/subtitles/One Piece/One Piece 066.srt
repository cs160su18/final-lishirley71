00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,360
I can't fall in a place like this.
I've got an important mission...

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,160
How pitiful...

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,430
...losing against just one swordsman...

24
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,310
Mr. 5! Miss Valentine!
Why are you here?!

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,420
You really have no idea?

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,030
There're criminals here that
are big enough for the boss

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,740
to send us here to deal with.

28
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,470
These're the boss' words:
"They've found out my secrets."

29
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,040
Of course, I don't even know what
kind of secrets they are, but...

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,740
So, when we very carefully
investigated who learned his secrets...

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,750
Oh boy, we found out that a VIP

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,820
from a certain kingdom
sneaked into Baroque Works.

33
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,840
They know! It's all over!

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,190
Die! Igarappappa!

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,730
I won't let you lay
a finger on our princess!

36
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,960
On my name as Squad Captain
of Alabasta Kingdom Security!

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,220
Igaram!

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,130
Igaram, Squad Captain
of Alabasta Kingdom Security!

39
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,470
And Princess Nefertari Vivi!

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,210
In the name of the Baroque Works'
boss, we'll eliminate you two.

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,820
"All-Out Battle! Luffy vs. Zoro,
Mysterious Grand Duel!"

42
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,430
Damn...

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,940
And I left Luffy down there, too.

44
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,500
Quickly, Vivi-sama! Please escape!

45
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,190
Igaram!

46
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,610
Igaram!

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,330
It's no use!

48
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,440
You monsters!

49
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,220
You're a princess, Miss Wednesday?!

50
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,810
Quit being dumb, Mr. 9!

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,270
This is one screwed-up night!
You guys can do whatever you want!

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,780
V-Vivi-sama...

53
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,670
Igaram! Are you all right?!

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,480
Vivi-sama! Never mind me!
Just please... escape from here!

55
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,120
For our motherland...

56
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,890
Without you, our kingdom
of Alabasta will be...

57
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,570
Please! Hurry!

58
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,090
You think you can escape from us?

59
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,750
Don't mess with me!

60
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,440
I'm having a hard time
swallowing what's going on here,

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,170
but we've been a pair for a long time.

62
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,730
I'll buy you some time!

63
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,470
Get going, Miss Wednesday!

64
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,810
Mr. 9!

65
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,190
Pretty manly, wouldn't you say?

66
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,190
Bye-bye, baby!

67
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,160
Hot-blooded Bat...

68
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,880
Mr. 9!

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,990
All we need is the will to
accomplish our missions.

70
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,500
A pathetic sense of camaraderie
will only bring about death.

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,290
Time to learn that the
hard way! Nose Fancy...

72
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,440
...of Guts!

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,380
...Cannon!

74
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,040
Mr. 9!

75
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,300
Whoa, now! That's some
dangerous snot he's got!

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
What the hell?!

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,990
Sir Swordsman!

78
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,350
Upon seeing your skill, I have a request,
unreasonable as it may be!

79
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,310
Yeah, right! Screw that! Let go of me!

80
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,160
As both of those people possess
Devil Fruit powers, I can't stop them!

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
Might I ask you to protect
the princess in my place?!

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,200
Please!

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,640
Huh?!

84
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,460
Karoo! Run!

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,180
There she goes.

86
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,320
She can't get away from us.
Let's get her, Miss Valentine!

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,940
Right, Mr. 5!

88
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,060
If you can safely deliver the princess

89
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,080
to the great kingdom of
Alabasta far east of here...

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,990
...I promise that you
will be rewarded immensely!

91
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,090
I humbly beg of you!
Please, keep the princess safe!

92
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,040
Screw that! You were trying to
kill us until just a minute ago!

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Don't make me cut you some more!

94
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,730
Is this "immense reward" for real?

95
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,190
I'll take up that offer!
How does one billion Berries sound?

96
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,980
Nami!

97
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,550
O-One billion Be--?!

98
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,170
Ma-ma-ma...

99
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,050
I thought you were asleep?

100
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,630
Come on, now.

101
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,360
Who in their right mind
would sleep carelessly

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,370
in an overly suspicious town
that welcomes pirates?

103
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,800
It was all an act! A-C-T, act!

104
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
I could keep on going if I wanted!

105
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
That so?

106
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,060
Ma-ma-ma...

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,910
So, will you promise us the
one billion, Squad Captain?

108
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,100
If you don't ask for our help,
your princess probably will die...

109
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,560
A mere soldier like me can't
promise such large sums of money...

110
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,100
You're not suggesting a princess
is worth less than that, are you?

111
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Pay it.

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
Now she's threatening him!

113
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,560
In that case, if you're willing to
safely deliver the princess there,

114
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,910
it would be best if you negotiate
the terms with her directly!

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,870
Meaning I gotta start by saving her, huh?

116
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,890
Even as we speak, her life is in danger!

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,840
Alright, then.
I'll save your princess for now.

118
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,910
Okay! Go get her, Zoro!

119
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,720
Yeah, right, you idiot!

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Why do I have to go along
with your money-making schemes?!

121
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,810
Geez, you're so stupid!

122
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,760
My money is mine, but my
contracts belong to all of you!

123
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,200
That's the kind of logic a bully would use!

124
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,430
What's the big deal?! All you
gotta do is cut those guys down!

125
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,210
I don't like bein' used,
unlike that idiot cook!

126
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,670
You're just afraid you can't beat them!

127
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,240
What?! Just try saying that some more!

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,220
You're just afraid you can't beat them!

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,010
Bathroom.

130
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,210
Quit repeating that crap!

131
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,420
Hey, now. Have you forgotten?
You owe me money.

132
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,890
Huh?! I don't owe you nothin'.

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,210
I lent you 100,000 Berries
for some swords in Loguetown.

134
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,730
I gave you the 100,000 right back!

135
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,360
Someone gave me some swords,
so I didn't use the money!

136
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,610
But you did agree to pay me back 300%--
300,000 Berries total.

137
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,380
There's something I wanna buy.

138
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,250
Sure, I can lend you money!
If you pay me back 300%!

139
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,050
You haven't paid back the
other 200,000 Berries yet.

140
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,840
I gave you the 100,000 Berries
back the same day! Gimme a break!

141
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,900
Nope!

142
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,440
Can't you keep even a single promise?

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
Do what I say,
and maybe I'll call us even!

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,830
D-Dammit! You're not gonna
die a good death, you know!

145
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,570
Yeah. I'm going to Hell.

146
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,300
Damn woman!

147
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,100
Thanks a bunch!

148
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,260
I'm so ashamed...

149
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,640
If only I'd been stronger,
I could have protected the princess!

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,580
Don't worry about it!
He's insanely strong!

151
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,340
If anything should happen to
the princess-- to Vivi-sama...

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,550
...the kingdom of Alabasta
would be finished...

153
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,070
She must live!

154
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,290
Run! Run, Karoo!

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,800
There's a ship docked
behind the cactus rocks!

156
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,540
We're going to use it
to escape from this island!

157
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,150
And then we'll go to Alabasta!

158
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,580
Much better! Now for more sleep!

159
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,440
What in the world?!

160
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,500
Hurry, Karoo!

161
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,220
Karoo! Stop!

162
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,510
Mr. 5...

163
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,710
They've found us! Karoo!
This way! Hurry!

164
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,670
Such pointless struggling.

165
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,170
Miss Monday!

166
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,820
Go on. You can get to
the ships through here.

167
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,540
I'll hold them off here!

168
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,450
But...

169
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,560
Thanks to that
freakishly strong swordsman,

170
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,790
we're all going to get punished
for failing our mission anyway.

171
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,740
Plus I'd much rather get my
butt kicked shielding a friend.

172
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,960
C'mon, what're you standing around for?!

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,860
If you get killed, Mr. 8 and Mr. 9's
sacrifices will be for nothing!

174
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,790
Get going!

175
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,210
Thank you.

176
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,470
First Mr. 9, and now you...

177
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,890
...Miss Monday?

178
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,760
I won't let you pass.
I bet my pride on it!

179
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,230
You're so funny!

180
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,360
You're a disgrace...

181
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,200
...to Baroque Works!

182
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,700
Miss Monday...

183
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
Miss Monday...

184
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm a "bomb man"-- I can
make my entire body explode.

185
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,990
Thanks to this Bomb-Bomb Fruit power,

186
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,370
there is no mission I haven't completed!

187
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,800
Using my Kilo-Kilo Fruit power,

188
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,040
I'll bury that backstabbing
Miss Monday into the ground!

189
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,730
I'm able to change
my body weight at will!

190
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,960
Right now I'm light enough
to be lifted by the wind!

191
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,480
But now it's time to get heavy!

192
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,270
2 kilograms... 3 kilograms...

193
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,210
5 kilograms... 10 kilograms... 100 kilograms...

194
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,620
1000 kilograms!

195
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,210
10,000 Kilogram Press!

196
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,860
Well? Do you still think
you could survive that?

197
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,530
There is no possible escape from us.

198
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,500
I will survive... I will return...

199
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,600
I will return to Alabasta alive!

200
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,420
Take this! Nose Fancy...

201
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,930
...Cannon!

202
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,360
Mr. Bushido!

203
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,670
T-The street!

204
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,290
Who's he?

205
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,260
I cut his booger!

206
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,510
Damn you! You never give up!

207
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,490
Now, of all times!

208
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,510
Don't get hasty. I'm here to rescue you.

209
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,730
Eh? Me?

210
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,460
Say...

211
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,430
What is Baroque Works, anyway?

212
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,510
A secret crime syndicate.

213
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,300
None of its members knows
their boss' face or name.

214
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,230
Its main work is espionage, assassination,
larceny, and bounty-hunting.

215
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,440
It's all done at their boss' command.

216
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,010
Why would they listen to their boss,
whose identity they don't know?

217
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,980
Baroque Works' ultimate objective
is the founding of an ideal nation!

218
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,000
Everyone who does well
within the company now

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,340
will be guaranteed a high social
standing within the ideal nation

220
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,570
that the boss will be
creating before long.

221
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,280
I see...

222
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,780
The boss's codename is Mr. 0.

223
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,820
In other words, the closer a
person's codename is to zero,

224
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,760
the higher that person's
future standing will be...

225
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,620
...and more than anything,
the stronger they are!

226
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,210
The strength of those from Mr. 5
and above is especially incredible.

227
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,400
So you're the swordsman who cut down

228
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,110
all of the lowly employees in this town.

229
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,070
Why would you want to protect
the princess of Alabasta?

230
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,040
I got some circumstances
of my own, you see...

231
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,220
Well, no matter. You're our enemy,
one way or the other.

232
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,270
You're in our way.

233
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,160
Yeah! He is!

234
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,660
There you are!

235
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,660
Zoro!

236
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,850
Now what?!

237
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,720
Luffy! Thanks, but I don't need any help!

238
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,340
Or does that wench got you in debt, too?

239
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,700
I'm gonna make you pay
for what you did! Let's fight!

240
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,350
Huh?!

241
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,880
What nonsense are you
spewing this time?!

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,370
Shut up! I'm gonna kick your ass
for being such an ingrate!

243
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,130
Ingrate?!

244
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,960
That's right!

245
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,070
Hey! What happened?!
Who did this to you?!

246
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,830
Your green-haired swordsman friend...

247
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,040
What?!

248
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,450
Everyone in town welcomed us
and gave us lots of yummy food!

249
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,400
But you cut down every last one of them!

250
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,730
Well, yeah, but...

251
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,050
You will pay for this!

252
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,520
W-What a dull-headed person!

253
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,770
Internal strife, huh? Talk about lame.

254
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,020
Let's just get rid of everyone
who interferes with our mission!

255
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,490
Hold on, Luffy.

256
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,670
Listen to me.
They were actually bounty-hunt--

257
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,750
Don't make excuses!

258
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,590
What?!

259
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,590
Are you trying to kill me?!

260
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,030
Yeah! Die!

261
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,800
Dammit! Listen to me!

262
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,260
Hey!

263
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,760
That idiot!

264
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,460
He's serious!

265
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,690
Mr. 5.

266
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,370
It doesn't seem like
they're here to stop us.

267
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,770
It would seem not.

268
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,150
Then let's accomplish our mission quickly.

269
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,310
Our mission to eliminate Princess
Vivi of the Kingdom of Alabasta.

270
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,040
Why, you! Quit running away!

271
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,620
H-Hold on, Luffy! Hear me out!

272
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,310
Let's do it, Miss Valentine!

273
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,630
Yes, Mr. 5!

274
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,480
Quit screwing around, dammit!

275
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,050
That dumbass!

276
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,810
Now you guys've really gotten in our way!

277
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,770
Ugh! What the heck's going on?!

278
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,550
If you two wanna kill
each other that badly,

279
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,480
then we'll kill you both
ourselves while we're at it!

280
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,320
'Kay?

281
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,230
Now I'm really annoyed!

282
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,460
Time to die at the hands
of my Kilo-Kilo Fruit power!

283
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,460
Get ready! As I ride this explosive blast,
I weigh only 1 kilogram!

284
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,440
Mr. Bushido! You have to dodge! She's...!

285
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Shut up!

286
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,630
This isn't the time for that right now!

287
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,400
That was a good workout!
Finally managed to digest that food!

288
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,360
M-Mr. 5?! No way!

289
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,570
He took out a Baroque
Works officer agent?!

290
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,230
Now I can fight for reals.

291
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,600
Hold on, Luffy.

292
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,310
Here I come!

293
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,860
Calm down and hear me out.

294
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:20,460
I can change to 10,000 kilograms!

295
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,730
Everyone in town was a bounty hunter.

296
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,460
Our enemy, in other words.

297
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,180
Hey! Don't ignore me!

298
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,470
Liar! Enemies wouldn't
give us food to eat!

299
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,030
Take this! 10,000 Kilogram Press!

300
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,490
Luffy.

301
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,420
Looks like trying to talk
sense into you is pointless.

302
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,030
You dumb dimwit!

303
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,040
In that case, I'm gonna fight to kill, too!

304
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't regret it when you die!

305
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,350
Sounds great to me!

306
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,040
Hold on! What's going on?!

307
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,420
Weren't these two people friends?!

308
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,490
Gum-Gum...

309
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,370
Oni...

310
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,300
...Bazooka!

311
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,660
..Giri!

312
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,800
This is the perfect chance
to see which is stronger,

313
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,430
brute force or swordsmanship!

314
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,590
Yeah! Let's find out once and for all!

315
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,510
Tatsu-Maki!

316
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,480
Gum-Gum...

317
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,670
...Pistol!

318
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,630
What now?

319
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,320
I want to escape, but will we be
all right if we pass through here?

320
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,040
Damn it!

321
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,470
The title of Baroque Works
Officer Agent will be shamed

322
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,810
if we let these guys make fools of us!

323
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,590
Mr. 5! Let's show them how
truly terrifying we can be!

324
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,850
Let's do it, Miss Valentine!

325
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,550
Yes, Mr. 5!

326
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,320
Don't mock us!
We're Baroque Works Officer Agents!

327
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,190
Quit being so damn annoying!

328
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,700
You're interfering...

329
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,630
...with our fight!

330
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

331
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

332
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

333
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

334
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:39,640
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

335
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

336
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

337
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

338
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

339
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

340
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

341
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

342
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,520
Who decided she's coming with us?!

343
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,380
Now we'll have lots
more people after us!

344
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,890
I'm so excited!

345
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,990
We're lucky!

346
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,590
It feels like we've hit the big time now!

347
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,700
Do you guys even understand?!
We're in big trouble!

348
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,960
Oh, come on. We've already
decided to take Vivi with us!

349
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,500
You will compensate me in full,
just so you know!

350
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

351
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
"Deliver Princess Vivi!
The Luffy Pirates Set Sail"

352
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
