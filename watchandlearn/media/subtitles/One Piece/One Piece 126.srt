00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,770
I'm certain that what you're
after isn't in this country.

20
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,590
Isn't that right?! To achieve
someone else's goal...

21
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,940
What's the point in dying over that?!

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,950
That's why I said you don't understand.

23
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Vivi...

24
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,640
She tells others not to die,

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,500
but she's the first to lay down
her own life to save others.

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,960
That's why I'm telling you that
you can just ditch that burden...!

27
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,010
We don't want her to die!
That's how friends are!

28
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,510
Vivi-sama...

29
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,510
I feel proud from the bottom
of my heart that I was able

30
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,160
to serve you, the Nefertari Family.

31
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,040
I am Alabasta's guardian deity... Falcon!

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,650
The one who destroys...
the royal family's enemies!

33
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,820
"I Will Surpass You! Rain Falls In Alabasta!"

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,980
Pell...

35
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,430
That son of a gun...

36
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,100
He... protected the country...

37
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,430
Hey... This can't be happening...

38
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,010
Wait...

39
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,730
Stop, all of you...!

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,760
Sergeant Major! Watch out!

41
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,400
What...?

42
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,160
Tashigi...

43
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,740
Keep a close watch on
where this country ends up.

44
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,110
Something is sure to happen
to mark the start of a new age.

45
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Madness...

46
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,610
Why... aren't they stopping?

47
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,260
Please...

48
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,250
...stop fighting!

49
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,710
Please...

50
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,000
...stop fighting!

51
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,570
Please...

52
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,050
...stop fighting!

53
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,120
Please...

54
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,240
...stop fighting!

55
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Please...

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,990
...stop fighting!

57
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,690
Please...

58
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,670
...stop fighting!

59
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,170
Please...

60
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,380
...stop fighting!

61
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,630
--Please...
--Vivi...

62
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,320
Please...

63
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,350
...stop fighting!

64
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,920
Please...

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,010
...stop fighting!

66
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,610
Please...

67
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,000
...stop fighting!

68
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,710
Please... stop fighting!

69
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,490
--Please... stop fighting!
--You dummy...

70
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,330
You guys! What're you
just standing there for?!

71
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,560
It doesn't matter if you have to
punch or kick! Just stop the rebellion!

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,900
Now! Go!

73
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,720
Ow!

74
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,630
Reduce the number of casualties
as much as possible!

75
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,190
Please...

76
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,850
...stop fighting!

77
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,670
Please...

78
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,310
...stop fighting!

79
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,020
Please... stop fighting!

80
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,460
Finally... the beginning is here...

81
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,020
The day that my enormous ambition starts...

82
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,680
This country is mine!

83
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,620
We don't want her to die!
That's how friends are!

84
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:43,260
That's why we won't quit fighting as long
as she doesn't give up on her country!

85
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,860
You... can't...

86
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,740
...defeat me!

87
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,870
You finally manage to speak
and that's all you have to say?

88
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,770
That's a bluff that suits you well, a loser
who's about to die any moment...

89
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,220
And it's even groundless...

90
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,140
I am the man who'll be King of the Pirates!

91
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,530
Listen up, brat. The more
a man knows about this sea,

92
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,780
the less he'd make such thoughtless remarks.

93
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,040
I thought I told you that there're
tons of rookies like you in this sea.

94
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,500
The more you learn the level of this sea...

95
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,720
...the more you'll give up
on having such dreams!

96
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,230
I am the man... who will surpass you!

97
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,220
The scorpion's poison
should definitely be working...

98
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Where is this brat getting
all that strength from...?

99
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,740
The Mr. 5 duo was taken down?
Who the hell did it?

100
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,120
Monkey D. Luffy? Never heard of him...

101
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,380
There must be a mistake.

102
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,660
What?!

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
Are you saying they're still alive?!

104
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,330
Sir Crocodile...

105
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,010
Those pirates are in this town...

106
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,270
You're just a brat who comes
from who knows where...!

107
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,240
Who the hell do you think I am?!

108
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,550
I don't care who you are...

109
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,170
I'll surpass you!

110
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Just fall along with this
sacred temple already!

111
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Sables...!

112
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,200
...Pesado!

113
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,730
Gum-Gum...!

114
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,180
Desert...

115
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,320
...Storm!

116
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,700
...La Spada!

117
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,110
Unbelievable... There's so much
bedrock between here and the surface...

118
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,210
Hey, look...! Look at that!

119
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,660
Crocodile?!

120
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,200
At this rate, so much blood will be shed
throughout the kingdom. It'll be a war!

121
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,710
I can't just return safely! I need
to return as quickly as possible!

122
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,210
If I don't make it in time, a million
citizens will kill each other pointlessly!

123
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,250
I see... Then all we have to do...
is beat up that Crocodile, right?

124
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,370
Luffy-san...

125
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,250
I don't know why he flew out
from such a place, but...

126
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,980
That's right! I knew it from
the start! But in any case...

127
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,960
He won!!

128
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,720
When our enemy's already gone...

129
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,540
Don't shed... any more blood...

130
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,300
Please stop fighting!

131
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,430
Koza!

132
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,340
Are you all right, Koza?!

133
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,550
Do you get it...?

134
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,340
What?

135
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,750
Don't hold suspicion, Koza.

136
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,880
The rain will fall.

137
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,910
The battle will end...

138
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,780
Rain...

139
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,850
The madness has stopped...

140
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,360
They've begun hesitating...

141
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,760
The air is clearing up due to the rain...

142
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,110
Please don't fight... any more...!!

143
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Vivi's voice has reached everyone...

144
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,070
Vivi-sama...

145
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,680
It's Vivi-sama...

146
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,190
Vivi...

147
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,190
I thought the princess was absent...

148
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,710
Hey, you!

149
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Crocodile-san...?

150
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,090
How come he fell into a place like this...?

151
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,510
Crocodile-"san," you said?!

152
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,160
I'll tell them what he did to this country.

153
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,470
Wait a sec. Just stay here.

154
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,870
The rain falling right now...
will fall again as it used to...

155
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,090
...since our nightmares are... all over...

156
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,060
I give you my thanks.

157
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,720
No problem.

158
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,650
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

159
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,580
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

160
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,830
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

161
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,250
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

162
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,510
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

163
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,930
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

164
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,730
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

165
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,480
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

166
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,700
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

167
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,810
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

168
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,740
A never-ending journey to be together

169
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,340
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

170
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,800
The guy on your back is
one of ours. I'll take him.

171
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
Who are you, old man?

172
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,040
Everyone...! Daddy...!

173
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,220
D... Daddy?! Is he Vivi-chan's father?!

174
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,390
--Vivi. Go back to the Square.
--What?

175
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,270
Of course! The rebellion has finally stopped.

176
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,810
It wouldn't be proper if the king
or princess didn't say a few words.

177
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,080
On the next episode of One Piece!

178
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,980
"A Farewell to Arms!
Pirates and Different Ideas of Justice"

179
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,540
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
