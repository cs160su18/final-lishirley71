00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,250
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,050
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,730
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,900
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,000
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,510
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,340
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,390
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,360
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,620
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,330
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,800
One Piece

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,580
"Great Adventure at Long Ring Long Land!"

24
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,800
How's our bearing look, Nami-san?

25
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,890
Perfect!

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,230
That's our Nami-san for ya!

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,660
The holes are just about patched up.

28
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,660
Boy, am I glad I had the foresight

29
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,000
to take a bunch of scrap
lumber back at that dock!

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,330
You're great, Usopp!

31
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,750
We should be okay for a little while now.

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
It went out!

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,340
Out of fuel?

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey, Usopp! We're about
to make a splashdown!

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,720
Hurry, Chopper! Bring all those boards up!

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,770
R-Right!

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,000
You can do it, octopus balloon!

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,940
You idiot! Just hit the deck!

39
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,780
Hurry! Hurry!

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,460
J-Just in the nick of time!

41
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,190
There, you should be all better now.

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,560
That's twice you've helped us out now!

43
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,470
Thanks!

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,190
Take care!

45
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,110
I hope you make some
good friends in the Blue Sea!

46
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,690
Go give all those Grand Line
octopuses a throttling!

47
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,760
So long, seafood ingredient!

48
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,490
Thanks for everything!

49
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,380
Be careful on your way!

50
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,080
Okay, then...!

51
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,910
Set the sails, men! Let's go to the next island!

52
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,040
Whoa, hold on, Luffy!

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,800
--Let us rest a little!
--Don't forget where we are!

54
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,680
Anyone could sail these seas
if it was okay to be so carefree!

55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,350
What are you getting at?

56
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,010
The waves have been looking a little strange.

57
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,480
Hop to it, everyone! Turn to port!

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,310
Right, Nami-san!

59
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,780
Oh, here it comes!

60
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,200
Full speed ahead!

61
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,080
--This isn't good!
--There's stuff in the wave, too!

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,170
Huh? Those are Sea Monkeys!

63
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,630
What's all the ruckus here?!

64
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,530
Run!

65
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,600
Quit pushing! W-We gotta stay away from 'em!

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
They're having a falling out?!

67
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,320
--Bellamy!
--Sarquiss!

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,070
Please! Make him stop!

69
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,910
Please! Stop! Why are you doing this...?!

70
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,960
--What's happening?!
--Sarquiss is in pain!

71
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,710
Why? Why, you ask?

72
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,420
Sarquiss... Bellamy...

73
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,300
It's because you've tarnished
this symbol of mine, of course.

74
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,430
"Does the sky island exist or not?"

75
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,230
"Is the city of gold real or not?"

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,110
I don't give a care about any of that.

77
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,550
You're to twist people around by
taking advantage of differing opinions.

78
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,490
That's what I told you...

79
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,450
...wasn't it, Bellamy?

80
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,220
That's... Don Quixote Doflamingo!

81
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,750
He's one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

82
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,380
He used to have a bounty over 300 million!

83
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,420
What's a guy like him doing here?!

84
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,130
I don't need useless punks
like you serving under me...

85
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,850
Crap! My body's moving on its own!

86
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,770
Stop! Please, don't...!

87
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,600
No!

88
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,270
Bellamy!

89
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,860
G-Give me...

90
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,490
Give me one more chance...!

91
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,460
I-- we-- will follow you loyally!

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,330
--Bellamy!
--No more, Bellamy!

93
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,470
Yes, I lost, but I never went
against your principles!

94
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,260
I swear on your symbol!

95
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,720
This is just my way of doing things!

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,260
We couldn't just run 'im off;

97
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,430
he would've reached you someday!

98
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,020
How very touching,
obedient subordinate of mine.

99
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,300
That's what I like about you, Bellamy.

100
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,780
A "New Era" is just around
the corner. Do as you wish.

101
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,310
But... I don't need you anymore.

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,170
Doflamingo!

103
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,470
He took out the notorious Bellamy--
a rookie worth 55 million--

104
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,140
like he was a baby!

105
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,680
It's finally beginning!

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,970
You'd better get ready!

107
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,610
A world where only true pirates
can survive is drawing near!

108
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,470
Those of you who are powerless--
run for your lives!

109
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,480
Soon, the tide of the times will wash over all

110
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,030
and a new era of champions will be upon us!

111
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Things've sure calmed down...

112
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,770
Can't lower our guard yet, though.

113
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,780
Emergency report! Emergency report!

114
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,850
Ship spotted at 12 o'clock!

115
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,770
--Huh? Are they bad guys?!
--This is the worst possible time!

116
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,280
Actually, there's no flag or sails!
I don't know what kind of ship it is!

117
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,870
Seriously, nothing at all?!
What are they on the sea for, then?!

118
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,620
Heck if I know!

119
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,830
The crew seems unusually small, too...

120
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,250
Plus...!

121
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,800
They're looking really timid!
Almost like they're lifeless!

122
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,820
Sea Monkeys! Run!

123
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,010
--Again?!
--They followed us?!

124
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,600
--Crap! There's no wind!
--Hurry! Furl the sails!

125
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,100
Row! Row!

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,690
What the...?! Is that ship gonna be all right?!

127
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,940
The wave's gonna swallow 'em!

128
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,450
Hey! You guys!

129
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,920
A giant wave and monkeys are coming! Turn!

130
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,160
--Oh!
--Whoa! A ship!

131
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,460
A pirate ship!

132
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,680
Men! Get up! An enemy ship!
Let's swipe their treasure!

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,580
Wait! A giant wave's coming!
We gotta escape first!

134
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,200
--We can't let that ship get away!
--Ready the cannons!

135
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,190
Who made you boss?! You do it!

136
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,390
Turn! Someone turn!

137
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,720
What an unorganized ship...

138
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,020
Forget 'em. They're not on our side.
They wanna steal our treasure.

139
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,480
--Which way do we turn?!
--How should I know?!

140
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,040
--Someone, give orders! Navigator!
--Don't got one!

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,070
--Captain!
--Don't got one!

142
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,530
Who just fired that?!

143
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,450
Grrr!

144
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,920
--It's no use! It's gonna swallow us!
--Damn! You're all incompetent!

145
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,080
--You're one to talk!
--We can't handle a single wave?!

146
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,910
Man, it's one thing after another...!

147
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,300
It's finally calmed down.

148
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,950
Those waves were actually
the Sea Monkeys' doing.

149
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,460
The humidity and temperature
are pretty stable now,

150
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,610
so we must already be in
the next island's climate zone!

151
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,930
Hey, Robin. See anything?

152
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,600
An island's been visible for a while.

153
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,100
Why couldn't you say so sooner?!

154
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,890
You're such a wet blanket!

155
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,770
Listen! Whenever you see an island, say this!

156
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,020
Go ahead!

157
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,860
Men! I see an island! Yahoo!

158
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,070
Now you say it!

159
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,370
--The fog is rather thick.
--You're ignoring me again?!

160
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,240
Fog? We gotta be careful.

161
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,040
--Chopper! Keep forward watch!
--Right!

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,920
Hey! Do you know how much we've
been waiting to see an island?!

163
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,850
I'm sorry. I'll be more mindful.

164
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,210
Really? In that case, okay.

165
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,130
Hey, is anyone else curious
about that ship from earlier?

166
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,090
They said they had no captain or navigator,

167
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,260
and they didn't even have flags,
sails, motivation, or organization...

168
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
What kind of pirates
would go around like that?!

169
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,190
Probably got into a battle and lost.

170
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,060
And their captain died
and they got plundered...

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,940
No, that can't be it!
I got a good look at their ship!

172
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,190
There weren't any signs of a battle at all!

173
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,570
Yet the ship was completely bare of
all the essentials that pirates need!

174
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,530
So they weren't pirates, then.
Don't worry about it.

175
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,960
But they sure seemed like pirates to me...

176
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,290
I somehow get a bad feeling about this...

177
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,550
You always do.

178
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,720
Okay! I wonder if there's a town!
I hope they have a shipyard!

179
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,050
Luffy! Don't go jumping off right away!

180
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,470
I hope we'll get a good shipwright to join us!

181
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,100
We're near the shore! Get the anchor ready!

182
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,110
C'mon, guys... Listen to me...

183
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,720
Chopper! Usopp's got the
"Can't Go On the Island" disease!

184
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,070
There's no cure for that.

185
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
All right! All right!

186
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,710
What the...?

187
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,250
There's nothing at all!

188
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,710
What is this place?! So cool!

189
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,510
It's all grass as far as I can see!

190
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,310
Man, what a dull place.

191
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,520
Do you suppose anyone lives here?

192
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,930
--Yahoo!
--Hey!

193
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,790
Me too!

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,300
Sheesh. They barge right into
uncharted territory like it's nothing...

195
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,120
With a view like this,
it's clear there's no danger.

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,390
What is it, Chopper--?

197
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,050
A human?

198
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,550
No human's this fluffy and shaggy!

199
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,760
It's a bear!

200
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,280
Whoa! So long! A long bear!

201
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,920
So high up!

202
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,520
Hey! This is an apple! It's so long!

203
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,490
--Don't eat it!
--Yum!

204
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,490
All the other trees are crazy tall too!

205
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,960
Hey, look! Is that a house?!

206
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,950
Yeah, it looks like it.

207
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,470
Let's check it out!

208
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,600
It's your relative!

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,640
That's a deer! I'm a reindeer!

210
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,740
Shake!

211
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,830
--Watch this, Chopper!
--Oh!

212
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,000
Wow! You're awesome, Usopp!

213
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,550
Sit!

214
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,380
Beg!

215
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,930
So long!

216
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,060
I-I can't even see its head!

217
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,450
Where'd they run off to?

218
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,410
They were rolling around just a minute ago...

219
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,830
We should disembark too.
There could be food here.

220
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,590
Hey! Robin-chan! We're getting off the ship!

221
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,540
Right!

222
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,500
Man, talk about long...

223
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Why is everything here so loong?

224
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,930
I feel like just looking at them's
gonna make me looong too...

225
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,930
Just what kind of island is this?

226
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,200
Hi! We're coming in!

227
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,850
Just like that?!

228
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,660
H-Hold on, Luffy! I bet this is
where the boss of the island lives!

229
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,280
He's gonna be some horrifyingly long
snake-man monster! I just know it!

230
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,530
No one's here.

231
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,660
Hey! Luffy! Usopp! I found a giraffe!

232
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,700
What?!

233
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,880
That ain't a giraffe...

234
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,800
It's got a long neck,
but it's a horse. A long-horse...

235
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,040
You're a horse?

236
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,020
What a pretty horse!

237
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,220
She's a girl! She says her name is Shelly!

238
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,010
This saddle must mean
someone's here after all...

239
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,880
What's up, Luffy?

240
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,560
Usopp.

241
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,280
--See those two bamboo trees?
--Yeah.

242
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,760
Whoa! I can't see their tops! Talk about long!

243
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,820
Take a closer look...

244
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,660
Okay...

245
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,950
They're running away!

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,080
Wha...?! This must be another long animal!

247
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,840
The bamboo tree's attacking Luffy!

248
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
H-Hey! You all right?!

249
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,420
I can't let you beat me, bamboo!

250
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,970
Careful, Luffy!

251
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,370
Gum-Gum Whip!

252
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,660
All right! You beat it!

253
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,850
Yeah! I cut it!

254
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,450
Where's your owner?

255
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,490
You don't know? That sounds lonely...

256
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,700
It could be bad guys! Stay there and hide!

257
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,580
What's going on?!

258
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,700
Actually...

259
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,310
...I cut a bamboo tree and a spirit appeared!

260
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,230
Our ship's... been blocked from leaving?

261
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,460
What are they planning?!

262
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,010
That's the ship I saw earlier...

263
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
Who are you guys?!

264
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,200
If it's a fight you want, get down here!

265
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,700
We are the Foxy Pirates!

266
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,710
Don't be hasty! All we want... is a showdown!

267
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,540
A spirit?

268
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,370
Yeah. He appeared after I cut the bamboo tree.

269
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey. Say something, you.

270
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,220
Of course I remember you.

271
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,430
It's been a long time. How are you guys?

272
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,600
One of you knows him?

273
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,180
--Nope.
--Me neither...

274
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,650
Ah, no wonder I didn't recognize you.

275
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,820
Whoa, what a flake! Who are you, old guy?!

276
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,480
My name is Tonjit. You have my thanks.

277
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,410
I assume you're the ones
who knocked me off my stilts?

278
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,740
Stilts?

279
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh! They are!

280
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,910
But they were so long,
we couldn't see the top at all!

281
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,590
Indeed. I was at the very top!

282
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,010
Oh, so you're not a spirit that came
out because I cut a bamboo tree,

283
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,310
you're an old guy who fell
'cause his stilts broke?

284
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,600
Why were you on such long stilts anyway?

285
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,270
I've always been fond of stilts,

286
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,070
so I tried to make the world's longest
stilts using this island's bamboo!

287
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,030
I managed to get on them, but then
I was too scared to come back down!

288
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,530
You're crazy, old guy!

289
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,870
I was up there... for ten years!

290
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,040
You're really crazy!

291
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,080
You were on stilts for ten whole years?!

292
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,750
That's right. The bamboo continued
to grow the entire time, too,

293
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,050
making it even harder
for me to come back down...

294
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,180
So scary...

295
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,220
That's your only comment after ten years?!

296
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,720
There are many trees on this island
just as tall as the stilts, though.

297
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,690
I was able to survive on fruit I could find.

298
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,770
He talks about it so casually.
Especially being up there for so long...

299
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,520
Speaking of long...

300
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,150
Why is everything on this
island so long, old guy?

301
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,410
It might seem that way to an outsider,
but there is a reason.

302
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,620
As you can see, a giant,
grassy plain covers this island.

303
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,540
In short, everything here is long
due to a longing for excitement.

304
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,250
Whoa. He went and said it.

305
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,920
Over there, for example...

306
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,510
--...is a plaaatypus.
--You just said it longer!

307
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,430
That's a Daaachshund.

308
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,090
Oh? Are you that same dog?

309
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,350
You're still passing by?!

310
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,770
Be careful-- there are ferocious animals too.

311
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,060
See? That's a snow leooopard.
Don't let it bite you!

312
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,210
Leopard?!

313
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,530
Why is it only long sideways?!

314
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,200
There he is...

315
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,060
That's the captain.

316
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,230
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

317
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,780
Chasing after something constant

318
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,410
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

319
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,660
Even when we're exhausted

320
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,830
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

321
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

322
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,170
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

323
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,970
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

324
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,930
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

325
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,010
Eternally... Eternally...

326
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,810
Wild fantasies from our childhood

327
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,640
We trace unforgettable memories

328
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,320
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

329
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

330
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Together we entrust our feelings

331
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,530
We go beyond the changing time

332
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,330
Eternally... Eternally...

333
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,800
My name is Foxy! I take whatever I want!

334
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Not another weirdo!

335
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,640
I challenge you, Straw Hat!

336
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,560
--Stop talking crazy, Split-Head!
--"Split-Head"?!

337
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,520
Bring it on! I'll fight you all you want!

338
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,940
No, Luffy! Don't agree to his game!

339
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

340
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,730
"A Davy Back with the Foxy Pirates!"

341
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
