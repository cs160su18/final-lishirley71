Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,250
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,740
I've been looking all over for you, Sanji!

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,510
Hm?

23
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,530
For ten years!

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,530
Her name is Carmen.

25
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,850
She's the No. 1 cook in the East Blue.

26
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm a woman of passion!
People call me Fiery Carmen.

27
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,860
Ole!

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,940
And, I'm Carmen-sama's
first apprentice, Leo!

29
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm her second apprentice, Jose!

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,950
"Fiery Cooking Battle?
Sanji vs. The Beautiful Chef"

31
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,360
Wow! How beautiful you are!

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
Say what?!

33
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,730
To think that you've looked all over
for me...! What a lucky man I am!

34
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm honored to meet you, Carmen-san!

35
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,580
Don't you dare...!!

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,770
What a passionate woman you are...

37
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,010
B... But, Carmen-san,
have we met befo...?

38
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,260
Jose!! Leo!!

39
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,830
Explain it to him.

40
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,270
Yes, Ma'am.

41
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Please have a look at this.

42
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,090
Hm? What're these?

43
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,640
They're all cooks...

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,170
Yes!!

45
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,860
They're all famous,
skilled cooks in the East Blue.

46
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,450
Every single one of them competed
against Carmen-sama and lost.

47
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,060
That's right! I'm the
No. 1 cook in the East Blue.

48
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,920
Those cooks who challenge me
are all disappointing cowards.

49
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,940
I thought that I no longer had
any rivals in the East Blue.

50
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,080
However...!

51
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,050
I came across a feature on
the Sea Restaurant Baratie

52
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,960
from when you still worked there.

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,790
That cook said that the Sous Chef
there is the No. 1 cook in the East Blue.

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,170
He said that you were an excellent cook
and that we were no match for you!

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,160
Since then, I've kept
looking all over for you...

56
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,230
searching every nook and cranny
of the East Blue... for ten long years...!

57
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,400
It's actually been ten days, though...

58
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,260
Carmen-sama likes to exaggerate.

59
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,210
Keep your big mouths shut!!

60
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,040
I challenge you, Sanji!

61
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,610
Come to the Cooking Championship
at the market at one this afternoon!

62
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll defeat you for sure at
that championship! Got that?!

63
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,300
Well, then! We'll see you later!

64
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,190
Ah, Carmen-san...
What a passionate woman she is!

65
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,000
Young man, are you going to
participate in the competition?

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,130
Huh? No, I'm not interested
in things like that, so...

67
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,630
Damn...! That damn
detestable Straw Hat!

68
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,040
To think that we can't find him despite
looking all over for him like this...

69
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,700
But Captain, why in the heck do
we have to wear cloaks like this?

70
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,310
Don't you know anything
about being a pirate?!

71
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,640
There's an annoying Navy captain
named Smoker in this town.

72
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,960
If he finds us, my plan to get revenge
on that Straw Hat will be ruined!

73
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,990
Anyhow!

74
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,500
Hurry up and find that Straw Hat!

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,040
Got that?!

76
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,460
Man, I'm stuffed!

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,040
We have to eat good
before we leave Loguetown.

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,120
I was starving.

79
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,830
To be honest, so was I.
I was hungry, but I didn't have money.

80
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm glad that I ran into you.

81
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,690
Hm? If you mean money,
I don't have any.

82
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,980
What?!

83
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,260
You don't have money?

84
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,660
Of course I don't!

85
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,830
That's true.

86
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,480
But, really... that Straw Hat
is an annoying bastard!

87
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,320
Next time I see him, I'll crush him!

88
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,760
Then how're we going to pay for this?

89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,830
I can't let him off the hook!

90
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,250
I wonder if they'd let us off the hook...

91
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,990
There's no way I can!!

92
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh, lucky!

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,310
Hey, you're going to treat us? Thanks!

94
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,060
Ahhh...

95
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,420
Thanks again!

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,730
Thanks for treating us.

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,720
You're... welcome...

98
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,110
Thanks for coming!

99
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,120
Thanks!

100
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,500
That voice...?!

101
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,330
Oh, yeah! It was that Straw Hat guy.

102
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,450
Uhh... Anyone home...?

103
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,770
You flashy idiot!!
Go after him already!!

104
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,340
Yes, sir!

105
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,560
Wh-Which way did he go?

106
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,100
A market, huh?

107
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,560
Whoa!

108
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,300
Just as you'd expect from Loguetown!

109
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,200
They have far better quality and more
kinds of seafood than other places!

110
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,990
Hm?

111
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,660
This is premium!

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,130
You have a good eye, young man!

113
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,320
Those're coastal fish
caught just this morning.

114
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,260
Coastal fish?

115
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,960
It's true that they're firm and fresh,
but I've never seen fish like this before.

116
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,270
Were they really caught in the East Blue?

117
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,190
Hmm... You're really knowledgeable.

118
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,750
As you noticed, these're fish that
you can catch only in the West Blue.

119
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,660
It's just expected that East Blue
people don't know this fish.

120
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,610
West Blue? Why do you
call them costal fish then?

121
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Young man, I bet you've
never been here before.

122
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
Huh? Yeah...

123
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,630
It may be because Loguetown is
the closest town to the Grand Line,

124
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,080
but we can sometimes catch fish from the
other seas, in addition to the East Blue.

125
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,350
From the other seas...?

126
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,290
That's right. They probably get
mixed in crossing ocean currents.

127
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,020
That's something that often happens here.

128
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,270
Hm?

129
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,790
Oh... sounds like they caught something.

130
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,670
Wanna go see it?

131
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,230
What's going on?!

132
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,440
Wha...?! This is...!

133
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,330
Amazing! That's an
elephant bluefin tuna!

134
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,870
That's right! It probably got
mixed in from the southern ocean.

135
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,000
I caught it with a pole and line!

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,420
A pole and line?!

137
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,510
Elephant bluefin tuna...

138
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,160
Ah!

139
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,020
Look at this!
It's a weird looking fish!

140
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,020
What're you doing with the illustrated
food reference book? Studying?

141
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,600
That's the elephant bluefin tuna.

142
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,050
What? You know this fish?

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,080
Of course! That's a miracle
food called a gem of the ocean.

144
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,650
I've never seen it though.

145
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,470
Of course not, since it's
a fish from the South Blue.

146
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,510
You never see it in the East Blue,

147
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,980
but it's a different story
if there's the All Blue.

148
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,910
Now that's impossible.

149
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,340
Yeah, I know.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,750
What's the All Blue?

151
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,700
It's a legendary sea. I hear that fish
from all over the world swim there.

152
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,250
Stop it. He's a kid.
He'll take it seriously.

153
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,860
Where is it?

154
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,330
See? He doesn't get jokes.

155
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,520
That was a joke, Sanji.
There's no way such a thing exists.

156
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,740
Don't worry about it.
Just keep studying.

157
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,470
All Blue...

158
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,110
Okay, then, haul it away.

159
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,070
Okay!

160
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,820
H-Hold on a second!

161
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,390
Hm?

162
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,200
How much is it?! Sell it to me!

163
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
What?!

164
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,170
I've got money! Let me buy it! Please!

165
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,340
No, you can't! This isn't for sale!

166
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,240
It's been decided just now that
this is going to be a prize. Sorry.

167
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,140
A prize...?

168
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,180
That's right.

169
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,700
The annual Cooking Championship
will be starting a little later today.

170
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,180
Cooks from all over the East Blue
gather for this competition.

171
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,510
This'll be given to the winner.

172
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,420
After all, this is an
elephant bluefin tuna.

173
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,520
It's exactly what a champion deserves.
So we decided to give it as a prize.

174
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,010
If you really want it,
you should participate.

175
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,980
You're a cook, aren't you?

176
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,090
Y-Yeah...

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,400
The registration is over there.
If you're interested, go register.

178
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,440
Hurry up or it'll close soon, young man.

179
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,620
See ya!

180
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,890
A cooking competition, huh?
All right, then!

181
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,990
Huh...? Wait a second...

182
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,110
I challenge you, Sanji!

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,310
Oh, well...

184
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,020
Now, the annual Cooking Championship
festivities are about to start!

185
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,500
We have famous cooks from
around the East Blue gathered here!

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,020
What a crowd!
I wonder what's going on...

187
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,980
This year's prize is
an elephant bluefin tuna!

188
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,150
It's a treasure of the
ocean and miracle food!

189
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:46,310
Who will earn the "East Blue's No. 1"
title and win the elephant bluefin tuna?!

190
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,750
That will be me!

191
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,670
I'm glad you came instead
of running away, Sanji!

192
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,260
But the East Blue's
No. 1 title will be mine!

193
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,430
This time I'll finally
prove my real abilities!

194
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,900
Oh, Carmen-san!
I'm excited to see you again!

195
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,150
Here's a kiss for our reunion!

196
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,310
Don't you dare!!

197
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,020
You haven't changed...
How passionate...

198
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,700
Hey! Hold on a sec!
Look! Look at that!

199
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,640
That's Sanji!

200
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,630
Yeah!

201
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,700
Hey! Hey!

202
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,000
Sanji-kun!

203
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,040
Sanji!

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,750
Nami-san! You came
to give me your support?!

205
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,560
Not really. I was just passing by.

206
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,820
But why in the heck are you
participating in a competition like this?

207
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,550
Oh, Usopp. I didn't
realize you were here.

208
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,040
I was the one who
called out to you first!

209
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,730
Now it's time to start
the championship!

210
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,550
These're the judges!

211
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,520
Also, to be fair, we asked Sam-san,

212
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,410
a member of the general audience
on his way home from a wedding party,

213
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,580
to join the judges!

214
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,580
Where am I?

215
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,570
Are you ready, Sam-san?!

216
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,050
Sam-san?!

217
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,110
Let's go!!

218
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,770
The rules are simple. First, each
cook will compete against another.

219
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,270
Whoever receives a higher
total score from the judges wins.

220
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,330
And whoever remains
undefeated through all the matches

221
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,020
will be the East Blue's
glorious No. 1 cook!

222
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,010
Well then, we'll now
start the first round!

223
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,330
The first match is Shoo the Lizard
from the easternmost extremity versus

224
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,180
Eoccoli, representing Loguetown!

225
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,900
Now, ready... Start!

226
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,950
What, Sanji? You're interested
in becoming the East Blue's No. 1?

227
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,850
Don't be stupid. It's nothing like that.

228
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,060
I just want to cook that fish.

229
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,100
Fish?

230
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,790
Oh yeah, that fish does
look different from others.

231
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,290
Though that fish's secrets
can't be obtained so easily...

232
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,530
Huh?

233
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,480
And at last, the final match!

234
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,720
Hey, people're really excited.

235
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,410
Yeah.

236
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,880
With his remarkable cooking sense
and skills, Sanji won through to the final!

237
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,070
With her gorgeous dance and cooking skills,
Carmen has kept crushing others!

238
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,470
Which one will win the
glorious elephant bluefin tuna?!

239
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,390
Hi!!

240
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,630
Hmph!

241
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,380
The anticipated
final match starts now!

242
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,020
Rinsing!

243
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,130
There she goes!

244
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,560
Carmen's cooking looks
showy at first glance,

245
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,320
but what she's actually
doing is quite simple.

246
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,080
Also her opponents get confused by
those two in front and lose their pace,

247
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,210
but how is Sanji doing?!

248
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,350
He's not affected!

249
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,920
Far from that, he's exhibiting
amazing knife skills!

250
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,340
Contender Sanji is silently proceeding
with the preparation at his own pace!

251
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,190
It definitely exists!

252
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,820
You're still saying things
like that? How silly!

253
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,970
That's why we say you're a child!

254
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,530
I'm not a child, you damn bastard!

255
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,500
That's enough, Sanji! We don't
have time for your stupid stories!

256
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,110
Forget it and go collect plates!!

257
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,570
I know... Theoretically it's
impossible. I know that much...

258
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,210
The North Blue, South Blue,
East Blue and West Blue...

259
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,850
They're separate seas
that you can't cross

260
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,790
due to the Red Line Continent
that runs from north to south

261
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,130
and the ocean current in the Grand Line
which extends from east to west.

262
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,490
A sea where you can find all
the fish from those four seas...

263
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,560
...should be impossible...

264
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,100
But it definitely exists!

265
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,550
That's right. Otherwise how do
you explain those West Blue fish

266
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,770
and the elephant bluefin tuna?

267
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,790
The possibility that the damn geezer
was talking about may refer to this.

268
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,550
If that's the case, I have no choice but
to look for it in the Grand Line after all!

269
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,880
It doesn't matter how long
it takes. I'll find it for sure!

270
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,330
The legendary sea...

271
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,340
All Blue!

272
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,930
Now it looks like Sanji
is starting to finish up!

273
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,810
Carmen is also close to the end!

274
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,960
Looks like all she has
to do now is dish it out!

275
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,120
The championship is reaching a climax.
Who will win the elephant bluefin tuna?!

276
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,190
The decision... will be made soon!

277
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,440
He did it!

278
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
Contender Sanji completed it!

279
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,810
And here is Contender Carmen!
Looks like she's completed it, too!

280
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,680
The dishes are all completed now!
Who will win the crown?!

281
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,180
Well then, here goes.

282
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,550
The winner of this year's
Cooking Championship is...

283
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,910
San...

284
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,300
Wait!!

285
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,390
I can't forgive...

286
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,150
Hm?

287
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,570
I can't forgive myself!

288
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,040
What?!

289
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:02,130
I always wanted to compete against
you some day. So I've trained like crazy!

290
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,050
I wanted to be on a level with you...

291
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,560
But ten years later...

292
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,530
...your dream hasn't changed!

293
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,620
I can't forgive myself for being stupid
enough to think that I could defeat you.

294
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,200
You win... Your dishes are delicious.

295
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,740
You're the No. 1 cook
in the East Blue, Sanji.

296
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,830
Oh... To think that Carmen-san
is giving me such a compliment...

297
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm so happy!

298
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,870
Don't you dare!!

299
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,410
What'd you do that for?!

300
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,930
I'll withdraw for now, but be
prepared when we meet next time!

301
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,180
I definitely won't lose.

302
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,430
Yeah, if it's a challenge from you,
I'll happily accept it any time.

303
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,500
The winner is... contender Sanji!

304
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,490
Ah! That was fun!

305
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,330
I don't know why but today
was a day of face-offs.

306
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,780
Hey, why am I
carrying the heavier part?!

307
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,290
Well... an elephant bluefin tuna, huh?

308
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
I wonder what it tastes like...

309
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Looks like I can use
the fins for making stock.

310
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,100
What can I use the ear areas for?

311
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,040
Ahhh! I can't wait to cook it!

312
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,550
Hm?

313
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,920
What's the matter, Nami?

314
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,680
The air has changed...

315
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,430
Air?

316
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,010
It'll rain.

317
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,350
Huh? When the
weather is nice like this?

318
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,460
There's no doubt about it. Let's hurry.

319
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,190
Huh? Hey...!

320
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,470
Ah! My hat!

321
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,620
Wait!

322
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,360
Wait, hat!

323
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,630
Luffy?

324
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,230
Phew! Good! My hat!

325
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,470
Hm?

326
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,970
Ahh... I'm here!

327
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,430
Lucky!

328
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,190
Found him! This way!

329
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,400
What?! Really?!

330
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,860
He showed up?!

331
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,720
Yes! We were watching
the square like you told us,

332
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,380
and the man on the wanted
poster appeared just now...

333
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,120
Okay.

334
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,460
Let's go flashily.

335
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,630
So he just walked right up...
Just wait, you brat.

336
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,940
Wow! So this is the scenery
that the King of the Pirates saw...

337
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,590
And he died here...

338
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

339
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

340
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

341
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

342
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

343
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

344
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

345
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

346
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

347
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

348
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

349
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,310
What?! Luffy's gonna be executed?!

350
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,640
No way!

351
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,310
By Buggy?! What a shame!

352
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,980
So all we have to do is beat them?

353
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
Yep! Help me!

354
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,650
Okay, then! We'll bring
down the execution platform!

355
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,650
I know.

356
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,180
Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Nami!

357
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,690
Sorry! I'm dead.

358
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,990
"Buggy's Revenge! The Man Who
Smiles on the Execution Platform!"

360
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
