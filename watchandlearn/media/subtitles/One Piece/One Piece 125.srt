2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,940
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

20
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,230
You were skewered...
buried alive... and dried up...

21
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,280
Even you, who stood back up after all that...

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,870
...won't be able to survive this.

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,920
Game over... The poison will
pass into your system soon.

24
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,250
You don't understand anything!

25
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,230
Hurry! Hurry!

26
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,330
What's going on?! The Navy helped us!

27
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,860
Did you find the cannoneer?!

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,070
We haven't confirmed it yet,
but there's no mistake!

29
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,350
I must've looked at it many times,
but it was my blind spot.

30
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,460
The cannoneer is over there without a doubt!

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,200
Nami-san! Vivi-chan!

32
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,240
Why are you up there?!

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,570
Hey! I looked all over for you guys!

34
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,740
Zoro! You too?!

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,450
What're you doing there?!

36
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,530
Ribbit... ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...

37
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,290
"Magnificent Wings! My Name is Pell,
Guardian Deity of the Country"

38
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,360
Baroque Works?!

39
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,710
We don't know. Where's the proof
that such a company exists?

40
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,190
We're ordinary citizens
of Alabasta, Mr. Marine.

41
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,800
In the confusion of the rebellion,
are you trying to harm good citizens?

42
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,340
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

43
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,760
What're you hesitating for?!

44
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,130
If you wait until you have proof,
you can't prevent anything!

45
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,930
Discern the enemy with your own eyes!

46
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,470
Yes ma'am! Our apologies!

47
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,300
At 4:30... We're running out of time...

48
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,700
The clock is...

49
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,110
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...
Hey, listen, Mr. 7.

50
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,130
I think this is quite an important mission.

51
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,700
That's right, Miss Father's Day.

52
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,910
I think perhaps we may be given
an incredible status. Ribbit, ribbit.

53
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,970
I hope that's the plan. I hope so.
I hope so, Miss Father's Day.

54
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,470
After all, our plan is to shoot
a cannonball into the crowd

55
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,400
using such a big cannon! So I hope so!

56
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,770
Ribbit! It's almost time, Mr. 7!

57
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,630
Preparations to fire complete!

58
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,270
What is it that... you say I don't understand?

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,740
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

60
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,510
Don't you get it? You'll die soon,

61
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,820
due to the poison that entered that wound.

62
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,080
Your body is probably numbing by now.

63
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,180
Whether you win or lose, you'll be
buried under this sacred temple anyway.

64
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,020
15 seconds until the attack!

65
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,900
The target is the center of
the Square. Ribbit, ribbit.

66
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,810
Ignite!

67
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,150
Hey, Nami! What the hell
are you trying to do?!

68
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,930
We really don't have time!
If we fail, we'll die! Hey!

69
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,160
I know that! Just stand there quietly!
I'm calculating right now!

70
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,060
Quietly? I don't understand
the point of this setup!

71
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,250
What the hell are you gonna do?!

72
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,880
You'll know once I do it!

73
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,680
Ready?!

74
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit...
Hey, listen, Mr. 7!

75
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
This is a rare occasion!
I wanna do a countdown!

76
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,510
Is that your plan? That's good!
That's good! Sounds interesting!

77
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,870
The weather forecast is "typhoon"!

78
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,320
13 seconds until the attack!

79
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,450
Cyclone... Tempo!

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,490
H... Hey! Cyclone Tempo is just a
boomerang game for after parties.

81
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,490
Make for the clock tower!

82
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,330
What the heck...? They're coming up!

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,220
Chopper! Jump to where Sanji-kun is!

84
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,090
What?!

85
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,990
Don't tell me... Is she saying...

86
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,390
...the plan is to jump
all the way up like this?!

87
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,930
Sanji-kun! You know the rest, right?!
We don't have time!

88
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,080
I think I get the gist of it, but...

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,650
Oh, heck! I just have to do it!

90
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,250
Sounds like we don't have time to think!
I'm counting on you, Tony-kun!

91
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,750
Okay! Hang on tight, Vivi!

92
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I see... that's what we're doing.

93
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,190
Chopper! Get on my right leg!

94
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,230
Got it!

95
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,270
11!

96
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,080
There! They're coming, Zoro!

97
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,910
Okay! Good job!

98
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,590
So all I have to do is throw them
to the top of that tower, right?!

99
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,220
10!

100
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,660
Zoro!

101
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,110
Okay! Leave it to me!

102
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,330
Swords?!

103
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,560
You dummy! Don't be scared!
I'm using the back of the blade!

104
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,670
Get a good foothold!

105
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,600
Ah, okay!

106
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,070
9!

107
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,280
Be careful, Vivi! There're weirdoes up there.

108
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,910
Yes. They're familiar faces.

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,020
Hm?!

110
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,210
No!

111
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,220
Miss Wednesday!

112
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,130
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. I know that
she's a traitor to our company!

113
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,210
They've noticed!

114
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,100
What?!

115
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,060
Wait a sec! We're in the air!
If they shoot at us...!

116
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,310
I'm certain that what you're
after isn't in this country.

117
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,460
Isn't that right?! To achieve
someone else's goal...

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,020
What's the point in dying over that?!

119
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,280
If you ditch a friend or two,
you can stay out of troubles.

120
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,710
You guys are total idiots.

121
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,810
That's why I said you don't understand.

122
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,540
Vivi...

123
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,590
She tells others not to die,

124
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,440
but she's the first to lay down
her own life to save others.

125
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,500
If we don't help her, she'll die.
You guys will kill her.

126
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,990
You're so dense.

127
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,100
That's why I'm telling you that
you can just ditch that burden...!

128
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,610
We don't want her to die!
That's how friends are!

129
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,060
That's why we won't quit fighting as long
as she doesn't give up on her country!

130
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,800
Even if you guys end up dying?

131
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,190
If we die, we die.

132
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,100
Adjust! Ribbit-Ribbit Gun!
This is an unexpected catch!

133
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,060
Adjust! Yellow Gun!

134
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,840
This is good! This is good!
They're perfect prey!

135
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,090
You bastards! How dare you
point guns at Vivi-chan?!

136
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,310
This is bad! They're a sniper pair!

137
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,710
Chopper! I'll shoot you guys up anyway!

138
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,450
I'll change the direction so
you do something after that!

139
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,700
What?! Me?!

140
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,620
Seven seconds left!

141
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,650
Do something!

142
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,860
Ready?! I'm gonna
shoot you up! Chopper! Vivi!

143
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,840
Okay!

144
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,360
Ready...!

145
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,300
Smash!

146
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,130
Go!

147
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,410
Hey, listen. Our bullets are...

148
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,920
...planned to crash and explode.

149
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,510
Zoro!

150
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,330
That idiot! He took a direct hit...!

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,630
Ready, Vivi?!

152
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,150
With your all might, please, Tony-kun!

153
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,730
"5 seconds until attack"

154
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,480
Ribbit, ribbit. It's no use...

155
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,570
...dodging!

156
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,900
Smash!

157
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,580
Who's that?!

158
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Huh?!

159
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080
"4 seconds until attack"

160
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,510
Where's Miss Wednesday?!

161
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,370
What happened?!

162
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,750
Peacock... String...!

163
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,210
She's up there!

164
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,140
"3 seconds until attack"

165
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,030
Go!

166
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,710
Even if you talk big,
your body doesn't respond, huh?

167
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,660
You look pathetic, Straw Hat.

168
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,790
Slasher!

169
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,800
Ribbit, ribbit! Sorry!

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,140
You missed!

171
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,940
"2 seconds until attack"

172
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,640
Run Back!

173
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,660
All right!!

174
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,980
"1 second until attack"

175
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,190
Vivi!

176
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,350
Hey, you brats!

177
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,610
You came in from the
shortcut again, didn't you?!

178
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,860
Ahh! It's the gatekeeper!

179
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,280
Ahhh!

180
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,840
Run!

181
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,810
Chaka-sama. Pell-sama.
Please say something to those brats.

182
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,500
Hm...?

183
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,050
Yeah...

184
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,530
Vivi-sama. Going out?

185
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,830
Yep! To our secret base!

186
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,710
Okay. Have fun.

187
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,780
Where did Vivi-sama go?

188
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,910
Hm? I can't tell you. It's a secret.

189
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,930
The clock tower, huh?

190
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,910
Was it stopped...?

191
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,190
Oh... You're alive...

192
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,670
Wh... What happened to the attack?

193
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,540
Hm?

194
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
What fell on me?

195
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,170
Ouch!

196
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,130
What's the matter?

197
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,440
They say something's wrong up there.

198
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,470
Vivi isn't showing her face...

199
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,530
There's a problem! Everyone!

200
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,300
Vivi!

201
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,840
The cannonball has a timing device!
If we don't do something, it'll explode!

202
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,790
What?!

203
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,210
How despicable!

204
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,040
I'd like you to at least say I was
thoroughly prepared, Mr. Cobra.

205
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,050
Operations should be carried out
considering unforeseen circumstances.

206
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,130
Even if something happens to the cannoneer,

207
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,680
the cannonball will explode on its own.

208
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,330
Well, the time lag is just a few dozen seconds.

209
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,190
I wanted it to be shot into
the center of the Square...

210
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,250
...but it should still do more than
enough damage from there.

211
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,750
If we do this, the rebellion will stop.
If we do that, the rebellion will stop.

212
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,310
I can't stand how annoying
your idealistic theory is.

213
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,850
Let me tell you something...

214
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,400
You can't save this country.

215
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,390
Dammit! What the hell...! The attack
was stopped, but the cannonball...

216
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,540
...has a timing device?!

217
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,650
If it has power to destroy a 5 km diameter,

218
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,980
the Square and the town
won't survive after all!

219
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,090
What's gonna happen?!

220
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,300
Does this mean that it was
impossible from the start

221
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,510
to stop the explosion in the Square?

222
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,480
He made us come this far to look for it...!

223
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,590
He even announced the attack...!

224
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,040
Just how far...

225
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,180
...does he have to go to make fools of us?!

226
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,080
Just how much does he have to mock us?!

227
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
Crocodile!!

228
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,680
That was...

229
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,480
That bird guy...

230
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,680
Pell!

231
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,630
This place brings back memories...
The Sand Sand Clan's secret base...

232
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,060
Pell, listen! The cannonball
has a timing device

233
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,060
Your unprecedented actions really gave us

234
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,330
and is ready to explode at any moment!

235
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,170
lots of trouble all the time.

236
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,020
It's Vivi-sama! What on earth is she
doing in the ammunition bunker?!

237
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,570
Hey, what happened?!
What was that explosion noise?!

238
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,200
After we've told you so many times
not to go near the ammunition bunker...

239
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,780
Ah, Pell!

240
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,420
Pell-sama!

241
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,960
I wanted to make fireworks,
but it didn't work.

242
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,460
You see, it's the anniversary of the
day that you joined the army, so...

243
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,170
What're you doing to the princess?!

244
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,970
How many times do I have to tell you...

245
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,530
...not to come near this place?!

246
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,160
You! Do you know what you just did?!

247
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,250
I'm gonna fire you! How dare you...?

248
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,790
Wait, Igaram!

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,910
It's okay...

250
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,460
What if you weren't just... injured...?

251
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,470
More...! Higher! I said higher!

252
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,210
Vivi-sama! Please never tell
the king about this, okay?

253
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,550
Because he sternly told me
not to fly with you riding on me!

254
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,750
If you don't want to, that's fine.
I won't forgive you about today

255
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,230
for the rest of my life.

256
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,890
You're the one who said
you'd do whatever I tell you to.

257
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,460
Say, Pell...

258
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes?

259
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,970
Why do you train for battle every day?

260
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,100
Because I'm a guard. I do it
in order to protect this country.

261
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,760
I have to be strong.

262
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,100
Who will you be fighting?

263
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,840
I don't know...

264
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,560
Rather than fight, I'll protect...

265
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,660
They're different?

266
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,030
They have different purposes.

267
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,980
Hmm... That's strange...

268
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,090
I feel proud from the bottom
of my heart that I was able

269
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,440
to serve you, the Nefertari Family.

270
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,480
I am Alabasta's guardian deity...

271
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,830
Falcon!

272
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,240
The one who destroys
the royal family's enemies!

273
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,950
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

274
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,890
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

275
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,120
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

276
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,570
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

277
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,790
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

278
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,250
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

279
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,000
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

280
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,750
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

281
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,140
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

282
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,100
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

283
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,280
A never-ending journey to be together

284
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

285
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,750
Please shed no more blood!!

286
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,490
Why aren't they stopping?!

287
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,370
Please stop fighting!!

288
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,160
Where is this brat getting
all that strength from...?

289
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,530
Who the hell do you think I am?!

290
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,640
I don't care who you are. I'll surpass you!

291
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

292
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,880
"I Will Surpass You! Rain Falls In Alabasta!"

293
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
