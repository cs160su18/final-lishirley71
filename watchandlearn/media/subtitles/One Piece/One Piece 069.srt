Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:13,410
"Coby-Meppo's Resolve!
Vice-Admiral Garp's Parental Affection"

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,310
Ah! I can see...

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,230
A million Little Garden residents
are out to greet Captain Usopp!

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,790
The girls' high-pitched cheers...
Kisses being blown all over the place...

25
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,370
Really, I'm so popular
that it's almost a crime...

26
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't fall in love with me, Mademoiselle.
It's not my fault if you get burned.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,340
Are you stupid or what?

28
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,220
Stupid? Hey, I heard that, Zoro!

29
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,550
Cut it out! Keep it down, you guys!

30
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,340
Seriously....

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,010
Sorry about that. So...?

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,350
Oh, yeah, so it's like I was just saying.

33
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,300
There aren't any islands, but it's easy
to hit reefs due to the elevated coral.

34
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,860
I see...

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,550
Thanks. That was helpful.

36
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,330
You're welcome.

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,150
Wow, it smells good.

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,690
Yeah.

39
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,530
Thanks for waiting. This is
today's dessert, Tarte aux Poires.

40
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,030
Bon appetit.

41
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,720
Wow! It looks delicious!

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,370
Yours is over there!

43
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,410
Hmm... Okay!

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,660
Geez... Hmm? Where's Luffy?

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,930
Oh, I asked him to go draw water earlier.
I want to take a shower.

46
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,720
I think he's at the water-drawing machine.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,140
No wonder he's been quiet.

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,920
Or not...

49
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,890
Ahhh... That scared me.

50
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,270
That thing is dangerous!

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,590
What? What happened?

52
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,220
Ahh! Luffy! Why'd you have to break it?!

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,010
I was just trying to
draw the water faster.

54
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,720
Oh, boy... The belt's
been burned and broken.

55
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah. I wonder how that happened.

56
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,860
It's because of your ridiculous strength!

57
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,390
Geez...

58
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,990
Can't it be fixed?

59
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,690
Well, we have to get
materials from somewhere.

60
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,870
In any case, I probably
shouldn't ask him to do anything.

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,510
Usopp, could you get water from the
other water-drawing machine for me?

62
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah...

63
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,050
What? Nami! Have you ever
considered doing it yourself?!

64
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,560
I smell food!

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,310
And you, show a little more remorse!

66
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm sorry. But there's another
one, so what's the big deal?

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,350
Nami-san, look.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Saying something like that
shows you're not sorry!

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Shut up! I can't sleep!

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Oh, the newspaper courier.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,190
That stupid Nami...

72
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,700
At any rate, I can't believe they deliver
the morning paper at snack time...

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,330
That can't be helped since we're
traveling in the Grand Line.

74
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,000
We should feel lucky that
we can still get news.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,710
I guess you're right.

76
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,630
Did something catch your eye?

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,270
What? Ah, no, not really...

78
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,190
I see.

79
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,950
Ah!

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,130
Wh-What is it?

81
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,040
Here! Zoro, look!

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,200
Hm?

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,300
What? This is just
a picture of the Navy.

84
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,340
Yeah, but the guy in this
picture isn't just anyone.

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,840
Hm? Hey, it's Coby!

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,130
See?!

87
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,310
Coby...? That friend you were
talking about the other day?

88
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,980
Yep! So what does it say?

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,030
What does it say? Let's see...

90
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,200
"Vice-Admiral Garp's warship has
arrived at Navy Headquarters.

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,990
The picture was taken right after
they crossed over Reverse Mountain.

92
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,330
Just as expected, Vice-Admiral
Garp had a relaxed, imposing look;

93
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,240
however, there were some young
marines whose faces froze with fear."

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,340
Whoa... So Coby has
entered the Grand Line.

95
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,680
It said Navy Headquarters. Not so bad.

96
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,680
No matter what people say,
he's a man who'll be a Navy mayor.

97
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,460
Why would he want to become a mayor?
Officer! A Navy officer!

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,690
Yeah, that's the one.

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
I see... So he's trying hard, too...

100
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,130
"Navy"

101
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,610
2,000 push-ups! Start!

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,110
Rope-crossing, 100 round trips!

103
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,610
Run 200 laps!

104
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,070
Those who can't finish within 1 hour
will be penalized with another 100 laps.

105
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,570
Practice matches!

106
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,760
Don't stop until you faint!

107
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,940
Are you okay?!

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,140
So this is Navy Headquarters...!

109
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,540
"23"

110
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,850
Okay, they can't see us here.
Please rest a little.

111
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,980
Yeah. Sorry.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,610
Say, Coby.

113
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,950
What is it?

114
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,200
Maybe it was too early
for us to come here...

115
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,230
What?

116
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,950
You saw it earlier, didn't you?

117
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,440
The way we are right now,
we won't make it here.

118
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,880
Huh?

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,650
There's a proper order for doing things.

120
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,160
Maybe we should try again after
we've at least trained ourselves more.

121
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,630
Yep! That's right. Let's do that!

122
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,540
Even if we're missing,
no one will care...

123
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,000
Hold on a second!

124
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,420
What're you thinking, Helmeppo-san?!

125
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,500
I thought you said
you'd surpass your father!

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,650
W-Well, I did... but if I do
all those things, I'll die.

127
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,230
Wouldn't you be happy
if that's the case?!

128
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,300
Once you've decided
to become like that...

129
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

130
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,910
Once you've decided
to become like that...

131
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,080
I've decided to be
King of the Pirates, so if...

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,350
If you can die fighting for that,
you should be happy!

133
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,610
Fighting... That's going a bit far...

134
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,110
No, you fight!

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,870
Against yourself!
So please don't ever say you'll run away!

136
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,670
Running away?!

137
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,890
You idiots!

138
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,850
You sure aren't going to
bring disgrace on me, are you?!

139
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,030
You wimps!

140
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,540
You two can be easily replaced.

141
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,620
If you wanna run away,
hurry up and do it.

142
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,610
Please wait! We won't run away!

143
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,540
Hmm?

144
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
We've come this far fully
prepared to die if necessary.

145
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,570
Please give us any orders!

146
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,750
We'll carry out anything,
Vice-Admiral Garp!

147
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,070
Carry out anything...

148
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,050
Did you just say that?

149
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,020
What? Uhm...

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,620
You've come fully prepared to die...

151
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,130
You definitely said that, right?!

152
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,900
Y-Y-Yes, sir!

153
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,270
Then stop slacking off here
and get to work!

154
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,010
Yes, sir!

155
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,280
If you could continue watching them...

156
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,030
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,680
What?! Navy Headquarters?!

158
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,930
Yeah. As people say,
Vice-Admiral Garp seems quite eccentric.

159
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,310
But he's higher up, right?

160
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,180
Yeah, you have no idea.

161
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,190
Then those two must be promising.

162
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,690
Hmm?

163
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,530
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

164
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,870
Why did you let them go
without saying anything?!

165
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,610
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

166
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,260
I... wanted to play with them more.

167
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,790
I wanted to talk to them more...

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,220
I was learning how to cook so that
I could make them a tasty lunch!

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,450
I didn't even say... good bye!

170
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,750
Ahh, uhm...

171
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,890
Why did they leave?!

172
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,860
Ahh, I'm sorry! Forgive me!

173
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,400
Rika, that's enough. Leave him alone.

174
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,110
Don't worry. They'll surely come back...
after becoming fine officers.

175
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,810
But at any rate,

176
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,650
can we really become marines
by doing things like this?

177
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,050
This might be that old
dog's hobby, you know.

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,650
Hobby?

179
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,530
That's right. A hobby called
"the retired geezer's torment of youths."

180
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,330
Don't you think that's possible
since he seems crafty and eccentric?

181
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,570
Shut up, birds!!

182
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,820
That old geezer sure is
quick to resort to violence.

183
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,130
His name is Vice-Admiral Garp!

184
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,550
Hey, do you know...

185
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:57,260
...that he's called "Garp the Fist"
and quite feared by everyone?

186
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,460
No wonder his fist was
heavier than Alvida's...

187
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,880
No, that's not the point!
Stop with the pointless chatter already!

188
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,320
Especially while we're working!

189
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,470
You get me in trouble, too.

190
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,440
Don't be so coldhearted.

191
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,710
It's our joint responsibility.
We're friends, right?

192
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,340
You say that only when
it's convenient for you.

193
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,550
Then please work more seriously.

194
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,970
Okay, okay.

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,950
On second thought, I quit!

196
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,830
What?!

197
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,030
I wanna go back to how I used to live.

198
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,440
It's no use saying
something like that now...

199
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,400
...although it's a different story
if we became a Navy officer...

200
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,740
That's the thing!

201
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,310
What's the thing?

202
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,750
We can't run away, nor can we slack off.

203
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,540
If that's the case, there's only one
way to go back to how I used to live.

204
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,110
That would be becoming important
quickly, don't you think?

205
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,190
What?!

206
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,230
"Don't I think"? There's no
way things can be that easy.

207
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,030
We have to work hard
and steadily with patience.

208
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,220
You wanna take an easy way? That's just...

209
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,660
What're you doing?

210
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,310
Doing only chores and continuing to
wait around won't get us anywhere.

211
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,670
So I think I'll strengthen my body.

212
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,320
You're kidding, right?
You know that's not possible.

213
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,180
We work so hard during the day
that we're physically a wreck.

214
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,760
Let's go to bed now.

215
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,490
I've already decided.

216
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,430
What?

217
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,990
I'll become important and go
back to how I used to live.

218
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,620
I'll surpass my dad, too.
I've decided just now!

219
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,000
Even so... There's no way
that your body can keep up!

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,340
Impossible! Impossible!
Impossible! Definitely impossible!

221
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
If you do that, you'll die!

222
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,830
Once you've decided
to become that way...

223
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,720
if you can die fighting for that,
you should be happy! Right?

224
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,430
I've... already decided.
Well, I don't wanna die, but...

225
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,730
There's no turning back.
I'll go as far as I can.

226
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,530
Later, Coby.

227
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,030
Please wait!

228
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,630
Hmm? What is it, Coby?

229
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,960
I should've known better...

230
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,960
I carelessly said wimpy
things like I used to...

231
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,110
You're right. The issue isn't
if we can do it or not,

232
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,750
but if we have the will to do it.

233
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,710
I've decided just now, too.

234
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,420
Your motive is a little impure, but...

235
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,620
I'll go along with your spirit!

236
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,680
Huh?

237
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,350
It's fine by me!

238
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,500
Then we'll compete
and see who drops first!

239
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,240
That's just what I want!
I'm telling you now that I won't lose!

240
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,950
Ha! Say whatever you want!
See you later. I'm going ahead of you.

241
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,780
Ah! That's not nice to go alone!

242
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,370
Who cares? We're not friends.

243
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,620
I don't have time
to be buddy-buddy with you!

244
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,500
What're you saying?
That's not what you said earlier at all!

245
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,310
Ow, ow, ow...

246
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,450
One, two! One, two!

247
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,450
One, two!

248
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,760
One, two! One, two!

249
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,960
One, two! One, two! One...

250
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,010
So this is Straw Hat Luffy,
the 30 million-Berry bounty head!

251
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,740
We have to capture a vicious,
dirty pirate like him

252
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,680
as soon as possible
and put him to execution!

253
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,230
Indeed!

254
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,290
Luffy-san is wanted for bounty...
Something is wrong, isn't it?

255
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,150
Stupid! A pirate is a pirate.

256
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,300
Once he's caught,
he's set to be executed.

257
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,860
I know that!

258
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,570
But it's not that easy
to accept it, you know!

259
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,380
Luffy-san and I are friends.

260
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,120
Shhhh!

261
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,470
Idiot! No marine has
a pirate for a friend.

262
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,470
Don't ever say that again!

263
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,250
Or you'll get fired from the Navy!

264
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,790
I know that much!

265
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,200
I won't say such a thing anywhere else!

266
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,150
You swear? Geez...

267
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,570
V-V-Vice-Admiral Garp!

268
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,660
What? You guys were talking
about something interesting.

269
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,820
Let me hear it, too.
So who's your friend?

270
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,540
Come with me...

271
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,240
I'll ask you again.

272
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,950
You two're friends
with that Straw Hat Luffy?

273
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,750
I don't know if Helmeppo-san is, but I am!

274
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,930
He said that we are friends
even if we're apart.

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,490
I suppose you're aware of this,

276
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,630
but we can't keep people
like that in the Navy.

277
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,570
But fortunately,
I'm the only one who knows it.

278
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,190
Do you wanna be a marine?!

279
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,970
Please wait a second!

280
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,310
It's true that I'm Luffy-san's friend,
but Helmeppo-san has nothing to...

281
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,530
We do! That's why we're here!

282
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,410
Helmeppo-san!

283
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,430
Idiot! He isn't someone
who'd listen to that now.

284
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,300
It's joint responsibility.
Joint responsibility.

285
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,870
What about you, Coby?!
Don't you wanna be one?

286
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
I do!!

287
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,830
Then, stop grumbling
and bring it on already!

288
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,290
We're not done yet!

289
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,080
Yeah!

290
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,540
No good!

291
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,630
We're not done yet!

292
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,490
We're not dead yet!

293
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,930
You wanna die that bad?

294
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,940
I've decided to be a marine.

295
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,730
Hm?

296
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,360
If I die fighting for it, I'll be happy.

297
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
No way we'd give it up yet!

298
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,080
I'm a man who will become a Navy officer!

299
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,710
Huh?

300
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,000
A Navy officer, huh? That's interesting.

301
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,950
People here have been calling
me eccentric for quite a while,

302
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,820
and especially this time,
they said all sorts of things.

303
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,110
Since I brought you here, I have to
train you so that you'll be very useful.

304
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,610
I tested you two to see
what you are really like.

305
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,810
What we're really like?

306
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,650
Although it may appear that you've been
trying hard strengthening your bodies,

307
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,610
I thought you might
still be weak mentally.

308
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,540
So I tested you to see if you're
working with firm determination.

309
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,770
So what's the verdict?

310
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,840
I'll acknowledge your determination.

311
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,100
But...

312
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,970
...you've still got a long way to go!

313
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,560
When it comes to weakness,
you guys take the cake!

314
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,690
You'll have an intense
special training every day.

315
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,100
Be prepared!

316
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,550
I'll overlook your friend situation.

317
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,670
But don't tell anyone.

318
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,820
Just cherish that feeling.

319
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,310
Yes sir! Thank you very much,
Vice-Admiral Garp!!

320
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,020
Alright! Let's go!!

321
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,400
Little Garden...

322
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,370
Yeah!

323
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,540
You've got me!

324
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,150
Ah, gentle song

325
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,420
Make it there for us

326
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,830
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

327
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,170
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

328
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:47,780
If you find the world is full of enemies,

329
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,510
I've got your back

330
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't lose faith

331
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,460
You've got me!

332
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,160
Ah, my love

333
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll hold you in my arms forever

334
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,910
You've got me!

335
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,380
So this is Little Garden!

336
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,980
What's "little" about it?!

337
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,650
It's like an undiscovered land.
It's a thick jungle.

338
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,990
I hope there's a BBQ restaurant in here.

339
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,320
As if there'd be one!

340
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,660
This isn't normal!
This is definitely not normal!

341
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,330
It's decided that we're not gonna go
ashore on this island... Right, guys?

342
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,000
I can smell adventure in the air!

343
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

344
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,000
"An Ancient Island!
The Shadow Hiding in Little Garden!"

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
