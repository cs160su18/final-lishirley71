The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,480
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,410
We are the one! Go ahead!

00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,130
Running at full speed

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,360
Put the pieces of our dreams together

28

Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,860
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,200
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,700

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,900
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,900

60
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,070

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,910
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,690
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,180
The Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,830
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,110
After capturing Caesar,
along with their pirate ally - Trafalgar Law,

76
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,800
they finally arrived at their
next destination - Dressrosa.

77
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,790
"Explore!
A Kingdom of Love and Passion - Dressrosa!"

78
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,330
We made it! Dressrosa!

79
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,400
I said you're too loud, Luffy!
We're in their territory now!

80
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,170
Boy...

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,190
This week, I'm...

82
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,580
...super!

83
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,330
I'm gonna find the factory right away
and ka-boom!

84
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,920
I said you guys are being too loud!

85
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,640
We should just go to the town, right?

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,320
Yes.

87
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
Listen, don't let your guard down.

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,390
If we fail to destroy the factory,
it'll mess up our whole plan.

89
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,860
Oh yeah!

90
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,130
I just had a good idea!

91
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,220
Momo!

92
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,890
Alright, go Momo!
To the town without stopping!

93
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,820
Fly!

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,760
You're too heavy! Get off of me!

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,450
I can't fly and I'm not
gonna enter the island!

96
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,550
My father told me not to!

97
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,950
You can't fly?! What are you talking about?!

98
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,260
I saw you flying!

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,910
I don't know what you're talking about!
I said I can't!

100
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,450
I really saw him flying!

101
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,700
But he doesn't have wings.

102
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,700
See? I told you!
I don't remember flying!

103
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,320
E-Even if I did fly...

104
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,910
What's your name?

105
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,020
I-I'll never do such a dreadful thing again!

106
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,530
I'm not gonna fly in the sky!

107
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,630
Huh? Are you scared of heights?

108
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,450
You bastard!

109
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,600
Ouch!

110
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,500
Don't disrespect me!

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,480
We warriors don't get scared of anything!

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,840
Ow, ow, ow... You!

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Stop it, you fool!

114
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,640
What do you think you're doing?!

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,820
Ow, ow, ow...

116
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,120
You're unforgivable!

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,560
What the hell are they doing?

118
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,260
Luffy-san, he's an eight-year old...

119
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,260
Cut the "warrior" crap!

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,290
I'm gonna become the King
of the Pirates someday!

121
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,200
Idiot!

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,210
I'm gonna become the shogun
of the Wano Kingdom someday!

123
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,030
Fool!

124
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,850
What did you say?! You eel!

125
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,890
You're so arrogant! You monkey!

126
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,310
Who did you call "monkey"?!
You're being rude to a monkey!

127
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,330
Enough, Momonosuke!

128
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,040
He saved us!

129
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,770
I'm sorry, Luffy-dono. Please forgive him.

130
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,330
Even though he's a child,
he's a proud warrior of the Wano Kingdom.

131
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,360
Having said that,

132
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,440
I can't believe you take an
eight-year old so seriously!

133
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,370
I don't like cowards! Idiot!

134
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,240
You...

135
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,160
I said "Enough"!

136
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,300
Dammit!

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,120
--Oh, Nami!
--Yes, yes! Momo-chan, come here!

138
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,180
That monkey is...

139
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,520
I know, I know.

140
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,660
You...

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,260
...Damn...

142
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,960
...Brat!

143
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,410
Get off of her!

144
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,730
What's their problem?

145
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,630
Like father, like son!
I didn't know warriors were so sick!

146
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,500
He's right! I wanna call you people "pervs"
instead of "warriors"!

147
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,610
H-How dare you say that!

148
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Hey, Kin'emon! Let's go to the town already!

149
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,410
How should we pervert...

150
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,520
I mean, how should we change
our clothes for a disguise?

151
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,620
Oh yeah!

152
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,090
Dress shirts for men!

153
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,490
Let-it-all-hang-out for women!

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,830
This is how people dress in Dressrosa.

155
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,270
Let me change you all so you can fit in!

156
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,300
Dressrosa is the best!

157
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,040
Yeah!

158
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,390
Stop lying!

159
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,280
N-Nami...

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,660
Hey.

161
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,050
I want you to keep this.

162
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,320
Is this a Vivre Card?

163
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,760
Yes. It'll point toward an island called Zou
that I talked about earlier.

164
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,150
After handing over Caesar
and destroying the SMILE factory,

165
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,960
I was gonna head for Zou.

166
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,290
My crew is there.

167
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,770
But if anything happens
to us, go straight there!

168
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,890
W-Wait a second!

169
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,800
What do you mean "Anything happens"?
Nothing will happen, right?

170
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,050
Who knows.

171
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,410
What's that?

172
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,980
This is a map that my crewmember drew.

173
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,350
Wow! So terribly drawn!

174
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,920
We're here now, at the
west coast of Dressrosa.

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,530
Doflamingo's palace is at
the center of Dressrosa.

176
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,650
The SMILE manufacturing factory must be
somewhere on the island.

177
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,630
We don't have much time.

178
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,900
The Factory Destroying Team must move quickly.

179
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,440
What's this smell?

180
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,740
We, the Caesar Handover Team, will...

181
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,120
...go across Dressrosa and
cross the very long bridge to north

182
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
and get to Green Bit.

183
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,750
Why do we have to go across Dressrosa?

184
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,160
We can just take the ship!
All of us together!

185
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,820
I heard it's impossible to travel by water.

186
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,080
Oh, that sounds interesting.

187
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,260
P-Please get me there safely!

188
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,550
CAESAR HANDOVER TEAM

189
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,570
Oh no. I have a Fear-of-Dressrosa-itis.

190
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,040
Kanjuro... I hope he's still alive.

191
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,170
And you all, the Sunny's Security Team,

192
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,070
should watch out for the enemy's attack.

193
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,840
Don't let them take the ship!

194
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,170
--What?! What do you mean by that?!

195
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,040
Are they gonna attack us?!

196
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,100
What?! I thought guarding
the ship was the safest!

197
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
Guys, we're in the enemy's stronghold.

198
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,870
But we're with Sanji so...

199
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,390
THE SUNNY'S SECURITY TEAM

200
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,830
Huh?! Sanji's not here!

201
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,350
I mean, Luffy and the others are gone, too!

202
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,750
They're the key to this plan!
Where did they go?!

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,170
Hey! Who's gonna protect us?!

204
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,150
Visitors to this kingdom are fascinated
by a number of things.

205
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,330
First, by the fragrantly-scented flowers

206
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,930
and the delicious smell of local food.

207
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,270
Smells good!

208
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,480
Second,

209
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,700
the tireless, passionate
dancing of the local women.

210
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,590
Smells lovely!

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,390
And another thing...

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,330
Hey! Wait! Give it back!

213
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,980
Huh?!

214
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,900
Wait! Mario! Hey!

215
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,800
Give me back my arm!

216
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,270
Boy! You're a bad dog!
The cotton's gonna fall out!

217
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,710
Wait!

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,930
No!

219
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,950
I got a side stitch!
Although there's only cotton inside!

220
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,120
S-Stuffed toys?!

221
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,490
A shocking surprise for all
visitors to this kingdom.

222
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,470
Hello!

223
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,480
I am a soldier!

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,300
Oh? Have we met before?

225
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,570
Your faces look familiar.

226
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,660
Oh, yeah!
You were in the paper this morning...

227
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,930
Ouch!

228
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,380
Oh no! The strings got tangled up! Help me!

229
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,800
What's this?! A toy?!

230
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,380
Hey, Luffy! Look at that!

231
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,360
Everywhere you look,

232
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,220
blending in with the town

233
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,670
and living side-by-side with humans.

234
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,590
They are living toys.

235
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,180
THE FACTORY DESTROYING & SUMURAI RESCUE TEAM

236
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,180
This is a kingdom of love
and passion and toys.

237
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,020
The port town - Acacia.

238
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,870
A man has been stabbed!

239
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,790
Oh, again?

240
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,500
What do you mean "Again"?

241
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Is there a phantom slasher or something?

242
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,050
No. Women in this country are passionate

243
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,820
about love and most are the jealous type.

244
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,770
So when a man cheats on a woman,

245
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,510
things can get pretty violent.

246
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,570
How scary!

247
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,990
The more beautiful they are,
the more likely to stab a man!

248
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,780
Toys are moving by themselves
but that's okay!

249
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,010
Let's eat!

250
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,380
Hey! Wait, wait!

251
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,280
All right! We're in disguise!

252
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm hungry!

253
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,520
Let's go this way!

254
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,130
Hey! Let's eat here!

255
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,560
Excuse me.

256
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,640
I heard there is a gambling
house around here.

257
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,510
Do you know where it is?

258
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,980
I'm sorry, old man.
This is my first visit to this town.

259
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,150
Why don't you ask someone in that restaurant?

260
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,960
Oh, I see. Thank you for your kindness.

261
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,440
What're you doing?!

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,770
I don't have time to fool around like this!

263
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,250
I need to look for Kanjuro
as soon as possible!

264
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,560
Whoa-whoa, relax.

265
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,170
I know we need to hurry

266
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,320
but it's better to get some information
rather than just run everywhere.

267
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,240
Isn't it strange?

268
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,000
Their king just abdicated from the throne
this morning.

269
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,140
I thought there would be more confusion.

270
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,220
Maybe, they don't know yet.

271
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,530
No way.

272
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,030
Let's ask. Hey, pops!

273
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,170
Don't!

274
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,490
What's your problem?!

275
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,920
You were on the front page of
the newspaper this morning!

276
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,450
Here's your order.

277
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,690
Thank you for waiting...

278
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,160
...or not!

279
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,260
Here it comes!
I couldn't wait any longer!

280
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,020
Dress Shrimp Paella!

281
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,050
Rose Squid Ink Pasta!

282
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,540
And Fairy Pumpkin Gazpacho!

283
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,110
Everything looks yummy!

284
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,540
Let's eat!

285
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,650
Yum-yum!

286
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,700
What's "Fairy Pumpkin"?

287
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,720
Um, that's... In this country,
we still believe in a myth about fairies!

288
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,730
Or not!

289
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,730
What kind of myth?

290
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,400
Well, people claim to see fairies! Or not!

291
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,200
Seeing fairies?

292
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,810
Yes! Isn't it interesting?

293
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,770
For centuries!

294
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,580
Even though most of us haven't
seen them, they do exist.

295
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,850
People call those fairies...

296
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,320
..."guardian deities of Dressrosa"!

297
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,710
Or not!

298
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,990
Ah, shut up!

299
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,830
Well, you travelers, please
take care of yourselves.

300
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,420
Or not!

301
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,090
Boy...

302
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,770
They are stranger than fairies.

303
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,810
He got it right again! 14 times in a row!

304
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,860
What's going on?
It's a little noisy back there.

305
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,530
It's a roulette game.

306
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,000
Some blind man is on a winning streak.

307
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,220
A blind man?

308
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,070
Place your bets!

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
I've made up my mind.

310
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,270
Black, please.

311
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,930
Did you hear it? It's black!

312
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,190
--I bet on black!
--Me, too!

313
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,980
Me, too, of course!

314
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,650
No more bets!

315
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,230
It's black 29!

316
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,170
Oh, it's black!

317
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,270
I can't believe it! That
was 15 times in a row!

318
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,940
Thank you! Really, thank you!

319
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,940
We became very rich thanks to you!

320
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,160
Boy, what should I say?

321
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,680
I was just lucky.

322
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,640
It's not that much but
keep it. It's a present!

323
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,410
This is from me! Go for more!

324
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,040
--This is from me!
--This is from me!

325
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,570
You are quite a gambler, huh?

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,910
Let's play just me and you! What do you say?

327
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,350
What? Just you and me?

328
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,740
That's right!

329
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,970
I wanna play a game against
such a very lucky guy!

330
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,320
Don't tell me you're gonna quit now.

331
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,180
No, I got chips from everybody as you see

332
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,200
so I'm going to play a lot more.

333
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Good! I like you, old man!

334
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,820
So everybody else, please
go to the room in the back

335
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,710
to exchange your chips.

336
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,140
Now, place your bets.

337
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,520
White, please.

338
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,350
Oh, okay.

339
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,640
Then, I bet on black.

340
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,790
How does it go? What is it?

341
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm sorry! It's black!

342
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,580
You were off!

343
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,210
Oh, did I? Then I'll get it right this time!

344
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,140
Okay, white!

345
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,750
Let's see.

346
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,380
You've missed it again. It's black 20!

347
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,290
It should be white this time!

348
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,680
It's black again!

349
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,860
White!

350
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,000
It's black!

351
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
White!

352
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,800
Black!

353
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,970
White!

354
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,270
I'm sorry!

355
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,940
It's black!

356
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,290
That's awful!

357
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,500
They're a disgrace to Don Quixote!

358
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,520
What's the matter with them?

359
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,220
Okay, say goodbye to your bets!

360
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,820
We can make a lot of money
when Buffalo-san isn't here.

361
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,010
Right.

362
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,590
I guess I'm running out
of luck. This is no good.

363
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,600
What do you wanna do? Do you wanna quit?

364
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,230
No.

365
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,670
One last time.

366
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,600
I bet everything!

367
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,170
Great!

368
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,830
Then I'm gonna bet everything
on whichever color you don't pick.

369
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,830
Let's play it like real men!

370
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,750
Everything? Really?

371
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,090
Yeah.

372
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,990
Alright, let's do it.

373
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,190
Place your bets!

374
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,230
I've made up my mind.

375
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,900
White, please!
