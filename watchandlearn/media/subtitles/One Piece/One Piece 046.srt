00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,900
Raise the anchor!

25
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,090
Set the sails!

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,530
--Bring the ship forward!
--You idiot!

27
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,650
--Don't shake things, Sanji!
--Full speed ahead to the Grand Line!

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,050
Shut up.

29
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,650
If you're scared, then go down
and sleep like a good li'l boy.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,600
D-D-Don't be stupid!
Of course I'm not scared!

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Sanji! Breakfast!

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,440
Yeah, yeah!

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,030
I'll get started on it.
Hold on.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,100
Good morning, Nami-san!

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,740
Good morning, Sanji-kun.

36
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,330
Hey. Hey, Zoro. Let's play tag.

37
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,430
Huh?!

38
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,160
What, what?! Tag?!
Let's play, let's play!

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,360
Are you guys stupid?!
You're pathetic, playing at your age!

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,990
I'm gonna get some more
sleep before breakfast.

41
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,500
Oh?! 'Cause you
don't like losing, huh?!

42
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,700
What did you say?!
I don't give a damn about that!

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,140
See! You're suddenly mad!

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,670
What?!

45
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,690
Hold it, you guys!

46
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,160
But it's the truth, isn't it?! Bleehhh!

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,400
Stop right there!

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,060
Does that mean you'll
join our crew now?!

49
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,740
But I'm only teaming up
with you, just so you know!

50
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,440
Always remember that!

51
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,990
--I'm over here! Come get me!
--C'mon, Zoro! Chase me, too!

52
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm not playing here!

53
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,860
Nami-san! Your meal's ready!

54
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,440
Hey, guys! Food's on!

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Yeah!

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,230
Hold it! I'm not done with you!

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,310
Even after he said all that...

58
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,740
Huh? What, Nami-san?

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,760
No, it's nothing!

60
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,570
Whew, I'm hungry!

61
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,260
Food! Food! Food!

62
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,220
This looks yum!

63
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,180
Say, what do you suppose
happened to Buggy after that?

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,070
Buggy? Oh, that Buggy?

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,640
Who knows? Maybe he's
at the bottom of the ocean.

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,400
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,260
Pirates are a stubborn lot,
every last one of 'em.

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,310
Yeah?

69
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,370
You're the one who kept
chasing me stubbornly! Oww...

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,830
I hunted pirates for years.

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,630
I can tell.

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,850
Not that it matters,
but your food's gone, Usopp.

73
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,890
Here you are, Nami-san!

74
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,030
--A Special Yogurt Dessert!
--Luffy! You stole my food again!

75
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,380
--Oh! Thank you, Sanji-kun!
--Give it back, you idiot!

76
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,480
Alright!

77
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,230
I've finally finished my flashy raft!

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,100
Just you watch!

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,700
I, the great and world-renowned
pirate, Buggy the Clown-sama...

80
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,870
...will get my crew back together
and get my super flashy revenge!

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,240
No matter what obstacles lie in my path!

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,080
The score must be settled!

83
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,550
You damn flashy
rubber man! Just you wait!

84
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,010
I absolutely will beat you senseless
and make you cry uncle!

85
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,140
Go! Set sail!

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,150
Stuff like this already?!

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,440
I refuse to lose! Damn you!

88
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,380
"Chase Straw Hat!
Little Buggy's Big Adventure"

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,470
I managed to make it...
to the next island...

90
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,980
Damn it! Don't scare me like that!

91
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm not some kind of exhibit, dammit!

92
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,120
Why, you...! Are you mocking me?!

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,160
You got some real guts, ridiculing me!

94
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm gonna eatcha!

95
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,000
I was just feeling hungry, too!

96
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,550
You've made me mad!
You're done for now!

97
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,170
I'm gonna eat you flashily,
so just give yourself up!

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,090
Chop-Chop Cannon!

99
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,720
Quit your flailing!

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,570
Just accept your fate!

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Sorry! I'm sorry!

102
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,990
Forgive me!

103
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,800
C'mon! C'mon!

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,750
My plan is flawless!

105
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,140
Yum! Yum! Yum!

106
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,220
I caught him!

107
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,210
I got caught?! Huh?!

108
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,660
How did things turn out this way?!

109
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,380
Stop! Stop! No!

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,790
Is this the end already?! This sucks!

111
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,480
Why, you...! Am I that bad-tasting?!

112
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,790
That's a little bit of a shock!

113
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,520
Hey, look! A hermit crab!

114
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,580
I wonder when he got on
board. At Nami's village?

115
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,730
Probably. That, or maybe
at Usopp's village?

116
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,860
If so, that's incredible!

117
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,050
That'd mean he's been
traveling with us this whole time!

118
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,770
Dammit! Why does this happen to me?!

119
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,750
Did you just say something?

120
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,960
Huh? Me? I didn't say anything.

121
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,940
Nuh-uh.

122
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,970
That's weird. Must've
been my imagination.

123
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,180
Hey, Luffy! Quit slackin' off!

124
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,690
Oh! Sorry! Sorry!

125
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,150
There we go...

126
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,300
Where am I now?

127
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,880
Leave!

128
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,210
Who's there?!

129
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,860
I am this island's protective god!

130
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,340
Leave this island at once
if you value your life!

131
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,300
Protective god?!

132
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Hey, you! You're one of those, uhh...

133
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,220
...weird creatures!

134
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,310
I'm gonna kick your ass, you moron!

135
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,570
Listen! Just try taking
another step into the forest!

136
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,540
The instant you do, will you
receive my divine punishment

137
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,230
and meet your doom?!

138
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,370
How should I know, you flashy idiot?!
Why're you asking me?!

139
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,560
What are these things?

140
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,690
The animals of this forest.

141
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,820
Don't mess with them,
unless you want to die!

142
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,040
Oh? These are some
flashily interesting animals...

143
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,630
I told you not to go any further!

144
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,580
Blast it! He suddenly shot at me!

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,560
Damn! I missed!

146
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,310
There you are!

147
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,360
What is this?!

148
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,110
Gotcha!

149
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,120
--Come out!
--Oww! Oww! Oww!

150
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,990
Dammit! You have a Devil Fruit power!

151
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,350
So what if I do?! You're nothing--

152
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,110
You're--

153
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,250
What are you?

154
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,600
Are you a boxed and sheltered son?

155
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,270
Yeah. I've been overly pampered
since I was just a little boy...

156
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,490
Of course I'm not!

157
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,260
Don't do stupid gags!

158
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,140
Damn you! Don't get cocky!

159
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,570
I don't show mercy to anyone
who messes with them!

160
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,810
Oh? You wanna fight me?

161
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,940
I commend your bravery,
but don't blame me after you die!

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,450
Gotcha!

163
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,000
Blast you!

164
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,000
Flying weapons are unfair!

165
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,880
Then what's this thing here?!

166
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,930
Don't talk so selfishly!
Say your prayers!

167
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,690
Chop-Chop Quick Escape!

168
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,610
Oww!

169
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,450
--How dare you?! Blast it! Oww!
--How dare I what?! Huh?!

170
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,300
I've had enough!

171
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,930
Don't move!

172
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,490
Too bad!

173
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,260
Anyone who messes
with the animals has to pay!

174
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,900
They're this island's treasure!

175
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,670
Those weird animals are treasures?

176
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,730
Treasure refers to gold, silver,
and jewels, you flashy idiot!

177
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,230
Don't play stupid!

178
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,560
You came to this island
to get these animals!

179
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,820
Why would I do that?! I didn't
come here 'cause I wanted to!

180
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,960
You mean you're not a poacher?

181
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,190
Don't be stupid! I might not
look it, but I'm a great pirate!

182
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,140
I'm Buggy the Clown-sama!
I'd never do anything as mean as that!

183
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,420
Pirate? You're a pirate?!

184
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,880
Huh?

185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Me, too! I used to be a
pirate a long time ago!

186
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,510
Oh, my bad! My bad!

187
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,120
So you're a pirate, too!

188
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,160
Whadya think? Good, huh?!
It's my own unrefined sake!

189
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,250
Yeah, this is the best!

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,940
How many
days it's been since I last drank...

191
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,040
You can have as many refills
as you want! Drink up and up!

192
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,230
But I'm really sorry about earlier!

193
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,510
I just assumed you were a poacher
who came to get these animals!

194
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,390
That was some horrible stuff you did!

195
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,390
But it doesn't matter now!

196
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,160
Plus you let me have
this delicious booze, too!

197
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,490
The only things in this world that
interest me are treasure and alcohol!

198
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm likin' you even more!

199
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,930
You're a pirate, all right!

200
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,290
You're a real stout-hearted guy!

201
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,340
Tell me, why are you on this island?

202
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,910
Oh. I originally came here
in search of treasure, too.

203
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,450
What?! There's treasure on this island?!

204
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,160
Calm down.

205
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,940
If there was, I wouldn't be
hanging around here, either.

206
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,390
O-Oh. You have a point.

207
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,930
Anyways, some stuff happened
and my crew left me behind.

208
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,050
So I've been calling this island
home for the past 20 years now.

209
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
20 years?!

210
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,850
You've really had it rough!

211
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,660
It's not so bad, really.

212
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,930
These guys are here with me.

213
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,000
This way of life is actually pretty
nice once you get used to it!

214
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:42,530
I dunno. I'd much rather be living
the pirate life with my crew.

215
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,160
True, pirate life is nice! It's great!

216
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,430
Even I would gladly risk my life to
go on treasure-hunting adventures!

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Right?! It's like, "Hurray for pirates!"

218
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,190
What do you say? When I get my
pirate crew back, won't you join us?!

219
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,840
Eh?!

220
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,410
I greatly welcome guys like you!

221
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,110
After all, you have the pirate spirit!

222
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,440
Well? Whadya say?!

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,690
You're... inviting me?!

224
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,330
I appreciate the thought,
but these guys are my friends.

225
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,070
When you live with them for
20 years, they rub off on you,

226
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,920
even if they are weird creatures.

227
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,880
I can't leave them now.

228
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,530
What? What's so funny?!

229
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,020
No, I was just
remembering a young pirate

230
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,070
who asked me to be a pirate
again just like you did.

231
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,620
Don't be so upset, old guy!
It's a good thing we came after 20 years!

232
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,430
30 years later and you
might've been dead!

233
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,330
Straw Hat...

234
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,840
He was such an incredibly nice guy.

235
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,810
I'm sure you and him'd be good friends!

236
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,130
I see. So there are
youngsters out there like that...

237
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,760
Not me, though.
I ran into this one horrible kid!

238
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,360
Assemble! Chop-Chop Parts!

239
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,980
Tadah!

240
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,310
Looking for these?!

241
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,420
My parts!

242
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,240
Way to go, thief!

243
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,280
S-Stop!

244
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,890
Go flying, Buggy!

245
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,330
Gum-Gum...

246
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,580
...Bazooka!

247
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,490
And that's how I wound up
on a wandering journey...

248
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,610
Just thinking about it now
makes me boil with rage!

249
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,630
I see. Sorry to hear what happened...

250
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,900
But it just goes to show there are
all kinds of youngsters out there.

251
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,510
In any case, let's have fun tonight!

252
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,520
We don't want this
night to go to waste!

253
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,360
Yeah, huh?

254
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,580
To pirates!

255
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,530
And to us meeting!

256
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,990
Cheers!

257
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,490
Sorry for asking you
to help make a raft, too.

258
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,090
Not at all. It was my pleasure.

259
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,840
So you're really going to stay?

260
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,700
Yeah. With all my friends here.

261
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,980
I see...

262
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,360
Alright! Take care of yourself!

263
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,650
You, too!

264
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,370
Farewell, friend! Take care!

265
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,510
Yeah...

266
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,040
You, too!

267
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,900
Set sail!

268
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,970
Alright!

269
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,350
Buggy...

270
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,400
There are many strange
creatures in these waters.

271
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,950
Be ever careful on your way!

272
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
Wait, I forgot to tell him that!

273
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,960
R-Run, Buggy!

274
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,880
Ahh! Look out!

275
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,650
Run! Get out of there!

276
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,000
W-What's that?

277
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,040
Pretty...

278
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,560
Who's that?!

279
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,690
She's super pretty!

280
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,970
Well, at least it looks like he's saved!

281
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,020
He had me sweating bullets there!

282
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,270
In any case, take care of yourself!

283
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,320
There's no need to thank me.

284
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,160
You're Buggy the Clown, right?

285
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,220
How do you know that?!

286
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,510
Who are you?

287
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm looking for a certain man.

288
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
You know him, right?

289
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,400
Damn rubber man!

290
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,630
Damn you!

291
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,190
Someday, I will settle the score with you!

292
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,530
Just you wait!

293
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,350
This is the guy you're looking for?

294
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,340
Come. I have a meal ready.

295
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,720
I see.

296
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,740
So that's why you helped me...

297
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,280
That's right.

298
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,710
So, what do you say?
Will you team up with me?

299
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,750
Sure, why not?
We both have the same goal.

300
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,590
Let's be friends.

301
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,420
That's great. Then cheers!

302
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,100
Cheers!

303
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,130
Sanji... Food...

304
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,280
You just ate...

305
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,370
Gimme a break...

306
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,280
Shut up, you guys...

307
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,310
I can't sleep...

308
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,100
You sleep too much...

309
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,330
Help out with work sometimes...

310
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,770
Sheesh...

311
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,310
I'm amazed they can hold
conversations in their sleep.

312
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,000
Talk about skillful...

313
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,730
Well, I guess I'll hit the hay, too!

314
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,640
Good night.

315
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,790
My overflowing feelings don't connect

316
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,630
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

317
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,550
I'll set off by myself,

318
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,510
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

319
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,230
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

320
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

321
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,330
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

322
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,630
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

323
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,470
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

324
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,220
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

325
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,570
With you, I can run there

326
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,150
Oh, yeah! Buggy's
henchmen were neat, too!

327
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,750
Yeah, you mean like the
unicycle guy and the lion guy?

328
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,160
Cabaji and Mohji, was it?

329
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,480
He had animals, too?!

330
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,210
Are they really pirates?!

331
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,890
Who do you think is their captain now?

332
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,060
Cabaji or Mohji, obviously.

333
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,130
Who knows? Maybe it's that lion!

334
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

335
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,210
"The Wait is Over!
The Return of Captain Buggy!"

336
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
