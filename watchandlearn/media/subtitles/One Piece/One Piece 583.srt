Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,710
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,240
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,550
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,540
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,940
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,520
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,--

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,820
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,120
Responding to an emergency
signal, Luffy and the

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,410
others were heading to the
other side of the island.

82
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,900
Meanwhile, Nami and the
others were held captive

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,980
in a mysterious facility
on Punk Hazard Island...

84
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,460
I came to this island to rescue my son!

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,130
I don't mind cutting thousands
if they get in my way!

86
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,260
--There!
--Shoot! Don't let them get away!

87
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,930
Oh no, that'll be far enough!

88
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,800
Weapons Left!

89
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,930
What's wrong with them?!

90
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,780
Who are they?

91
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Giant children?!

92
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,830
Ch-Children?!

93
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,030
What's going on here?

94
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,200
"Save the Children! The
Straw Hats Start to Fight!"

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,640
THE ICE LANDS - A MYSTERIOUS FACILITY

BISCUIT ROOM SANJI'S GROUP

97
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,870
Who are these kids?

98
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,560
Is this the island's day-care or something?

99
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,300
They're so big but are they Giants?

100
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,300
Did we come to an island of Giants?

101
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,140
But there are not-so-big ones too.

102
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,420
Then it's a multi-racial nursery?

103
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,140
There are no adults.

104
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,100
Hey, who are you?

105
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,110
I don't know any of them.

106
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,140
Oh, you must be the ones who got frozen!

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,070
Did you escape?

108
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,780
--Frozen?
--What is she talking about?

109
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,240
The mystery of the island deepens.

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,210
Isn't that...

111
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,310
...A robot?!

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,940
Wh-What's going on?

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,260
It's a robot!

114
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,760
How awesome!

115
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,640
--I love robots!
--They're the best!

116
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,450
Huh? The best?

117
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,940
Oh? Sanji-kun?!

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,070
Robot! Robot! Robot!

119
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,190
Robot! Robot! Robot!

120
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,950
You kids. So you really love...

121
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,090
...my armored self?!

122
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,480
Hey, tell me about "the ones who got frozen."

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,620
Look! There's a stuffed animal!

124
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,610
It's a stuffed racoon!

125
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,150
I'm a reindeer!

126
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,840
Lovely!

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,760
Cute!

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
--Help me!
--I want it!

129
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,110
Franky is so popular among boys.

130
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,980
Spiral eyebrows!

131
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,150
Shut up, you brat!

132
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,810
--You're right!
--So weird!

133
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,480
Stop!

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
A stag-beetle robot!

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,270
I can change my hairstyle as I want!

136
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,650
See?

137
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,770
See?

138
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,980
See?

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,980
Here is another hand!

140
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,080
With this I can...

141
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,410
...pick my nose!

142
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,080
Super!

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,840
Hey, somebody, listen to me!

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,500
Super!

145
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,680
Boy...

146
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,720
Hey, children!

147
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,150
Do you know a child named Momonosuke?!

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,110
He's a boy!

149
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm scared!

150
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,360
The severed-head talked!

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
Run!

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
Hey kids, tell me about this facility...

153
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,040
Wait!

154
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
You fool, shut up!

155
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,810
We can't get any information out of them!

156
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,620
You're scaring them!

157
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,540
The door to the Biscuit Room is open!

158
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,880
They're coming! Let's run to the back!

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,180
It must be those pirates!
Don't let them get away!

160
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,320
What kind of facility is this? Tell me!

161
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,820
I'm looking for a boy named Momonosuke!

162
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,490
Keep your mouth shut!

163
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,680
I got hit by a woman!

164
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,280
This is a dishonor to a samurai!

165
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,700
I should commit ritual suicide!

166
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,790
Go ahead! Just stop whining!
You male chauvinist pig!

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,120
--Those damn escapees!
--You can't go anywhere!

168
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,710
Wait!

169
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,490
Easy! We're not allowed to
use guns and explosives.

170
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,260
Use as few gas canisters as possible!

171
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,360
If we hit a child, the
Master will be furious!

172
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,100
Hey.

173
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,520
Do you really wanna cross this lake, Luffy?

174
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,520
THE BURNING LANDS LUFFY'S GROUP

175
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,280
Yeah!

176
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,070
But how do we cross it?

177
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,780
Some parts are burning but
there are ice flows as well.

178
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,030
The temperature could be just right.

179
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,360
We're all sweaty so let's swim!

180
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,160
No way!

181
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,910
Robin and I can't swim so...

182
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,630
Are you implying I should carry you?!

183
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,450
Why should I do it?

184
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,130
Stop looking at me like that!

185
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm sure Zoro wouldn't wanna...

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,110
He's already stretching for it!

187
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,000
Having said that, if we don't cross
it, we have to go all the way around.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,860
I have no choice. All right!

189
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
Okay, let's do it!

190
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,040
Special Attack - Green Star!

191
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,780
Fan Grass!

192
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,870
What's this plant?

193
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,660
Boaty Banana!

194
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh, it's a boat! That's awesome, Usopp!

195
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
And we can use this Fan Grass as an oar!

196
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,100
You have many kinds of seeds!

197
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,100
That's wonderful!

198
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,770
There were a whole bunch of weird
plants on the Bowin Islands.

199
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,030
The deeper I went into the dangerous areas,

200
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,350
the more handy plants I found.

201
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,130
I survived on that islands for two years!

202
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,480
There is no difficulty
that I can't overcome...

203
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,030
--Get on board already, Usopp!
--Or we'll leave you.

204
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,360
Hey, I'm the one who supplied the boat!

205
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
All right! Let's go!

206
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,120
To the land of snowcones!

207
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,540
Why aren't you rowing, too?!

208
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,750
It's so windy!

209
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,480
--There's a headwind!
--No wonder.

210
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,270
There is a big difference in
temperature on this island.

211
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,630
It makes for strong winds.

212
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,300
The water is boiling around here.

213
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,220
If we were swimming, it
would've been horrible!

214
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,350
--It's so slow!
--Why don't you row then?!

215
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,150
I won't let you get away! Wait, you bastards!

216
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,410
Oh no!

217
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,010
That centaur again!

218
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,820
Hey!

219
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Did you change your mind
and decide to join us?

220
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,410
Were you recruiting again?!

221
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,040
Stop asking strange creatures to join us!

222
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,250
Is that a horn?

223
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,460
Boss!

224
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,400
Boss?

225
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,050
The guy on the Snail said "Boss," too.

226
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,510
It's cold... Is this the Boss?!

227
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,770
The intruders are going that
way! Please finish them off!

228
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,900
Something appeared on the other side.

229
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,540
Is that the Boss?

230
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,080
So the emergency signal
was meant for that Boss?

231
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,210
Then he shouldn't mean us any harm!

232
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,430
I see a man with swords.

233
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,440
So is that the samurai who cut our people?

234
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,820
Now kids, move out of the way.

235
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,370
--Stay out of the way.
--It's dangerous.

236
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,610
Hey, Robot-san! Did you come
from outside the island?

237
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,110
Yes, of course! But I'm
a cyborg, little guy...

238
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,080
Do you have a ship?

239
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,670
Oh yeah, our ship - the Sunny is the best...

240
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,880
Then help us!

241
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,590
What does he mean?

242
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,130
Help us! Please!

243
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,470
Why is he saying that?

244
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,970
Then this is not a day-care?

245
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,770
Sis!

246
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,360
You have to help us! Please!

247
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Please!

248
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,900
Nami-san, don't stop!

249
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,080
Take us out of here!

250
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,040
Please!

251
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,650
Nami-san, let's go!

252
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,040
We are not sick anymore! We are all fine now!

253
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,500
Sick? What kind of sickness?

254
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,250
Damn brats!

255
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,660
Damn brats!

256
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,480
Hey, kids!

257
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,430
They are all scary people! You
need to stay away from them!

258
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,490
Is it true? They didn't seem like bad people!

259
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,850
They fooled you.

260
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,480
Then the stag-beetle robot is a villain?

261
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,430
That's right.

262
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,230
--Same for Racoon-chan?
--Yes.

263
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,530
And the man with the spiral eyebrows?

264
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:49,140
Yes, so let us protect you all.

265
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:56,490
We will protect you sick kids.

266
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,130
We will put them to sleep
with our cloud guns.

267
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,780
Please... Wait...

268
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,930
I want to...

269
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,040
I want to go home!

270
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,540
Wait!

271
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,630
Dammit! Brats!

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,390
Please wait!

273
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,800
Get us out of here!

274
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,220
Sis, please! Help us!

275
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,470
Now, kids, you need to stop!

276
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,850
Sorry! I have to run now!

277
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,570
What's going on?

278
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,290
Hey, let's take them with us!

279
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,740
Crazy! We don't even know
how to save ourselves!

280
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,960
There's no way we can take that many kids!

281
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,750
But what is this?! I have a feeling
- something tragic is gonna happen.

282
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,230
Then,

283
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,930
come back later and help us!

284
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,490
I knew! Even if I've never
been out of this building!

285
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,830
There is nothing on this island, right?!

286
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,320
There is no city! There is no one else!

287
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,470
That's why nobody comes to help us!

288
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,380
I want to see my father and my mother!

289
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,140
Sis, please come back!

290
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,640
Come to help us later!

291
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,820
Nami-san, come on!

292
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,230
Let's help these children!

293
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,070
What are you saying, Nami-san?!

294
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,590
We don't know for sure they need saving!

295
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,820
They said those kids are sick
so this could be a hospital!

296
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,070
We just met them and we don't
know what's going on here!

297
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,660
It's not our job to help every single person!

298
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,170
I understand what you're saying but...

299
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,600
...you can't turn your back
on a child crying for help!

300
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,680
Sis!

301
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,070
--They'll get away if nothing is done!
--Those brats are in the way!

302
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,450
Who cares! Shoot the brats too!

303
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,280
--But the Master will...
--Better than letting them go!

304
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,350
It's too late!

305
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,180
Sanji-kun!

306
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,730
Spiral Bro!

307
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,690
Diable Jambe Collier...

308
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,320
...Strike!

309
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,950
That's amazing!

310
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,820
That guy is very strong!

311
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,240
Damn!

312
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,540
Kung Fu Boost!

313
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,750
Racoon-chan!

314
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,840
Strong Right!

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,230
A rocket punch!

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,690
Th-They...

317
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,650
...stopped running!

318
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,540
She's kind to kids.

319
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,650
I mean, she's only kind
to kids but I like it.

320
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,270
I'm falling for her even more!

321
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,130
Chopper, you go ahead with Nami-san.

322
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,010
Yeah, I'll protect her!

323
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,210
Hey, brats!

324
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,020
Follow the beautiful lady
and the Kung Fu Racoon!

325
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,810
I will fight our pursuers!

326
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,410
But don't get me wrong!

327
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm just doing this to answer Nami-san's
beautiful wish to help you kids.

328
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,270
In fact, I don't like you all
precisely because Nami-san

329
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,030
cares about you so much!

330
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,830
Spiral Bro, thank you!

331
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,870
Shut up, brat! Just run already!

332
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,390
Let's go now!

333
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,660
Everybody, follow us!

334
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,170
Damn! They're taking the kids!

335
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,590
You don't have to do this, Franky.

336
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,640
Letting down Armored Franky
fans is not an option for me!

337
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,680
We will fight you!

338
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,210
Bring it on!

339
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,990
Snow! Snow! I love playing with snow!

340
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,040
IN FRONT OF THE MYSTERIOUS FACILITY BROOK

341
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,040
It's a great way to kill time!

342
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,420
Robin-san told me to wait here
but what's taking them so long?!

343
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,590
Ta-dah! Snowmen!

344
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,220
Let's rearrange its eyes and nose!

345
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,220
It looks like me!

346
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,930
Oh?

347
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
Hey! Hey!

348
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,940
Hey, who is it? Why are you doing this?!

349
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,580
Who the hell...

350
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,610
What?

351
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,980
Whaaat?!

352
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,950
J...

353
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,940
Just a torso?!

354
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,880
Nami and Chopper frantically push through

355
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,300
the mysterious facility to save the children.

356
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,390
While Sanji and Franky fight for their lives,

357
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,550
Brook is at the mercy of the powerful torso samurai,

358
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,230
until finally, the two begin their duel.

359
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

360
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,470
"A Swordplay Showdown! Brook vs.
the Mysterious Torso Samurai!"

361
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
