2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,740
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,000
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,580
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,750
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,440
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,840
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,100
You raised your price again?!

25
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,060
Don't you think your
place charges a bit much?!

26
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,480
Raise it again and I'll stop buying it!

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,490
What's the big deal?
It's just a paper or two.

28
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,020
Not when you're buying it everyday!

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,730
There's no need for
you to save up money

30
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,200
to buy your village back
from Arlong now, you know.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,640
Or to be so obsessive about money.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
You're so dumb!

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,060
Now that everything's over,
I'm going to earn money for me now!

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,250
I don't wanna be some poor
pirate who can't even dress up!

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,430
Whoa, calm down!

36
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,460
I'm in the middle of developing
my special Tabasco Star!

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,380
An eyeful of this
will make any bad guy--

38
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,070
Water! Water! Water!

39
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,070
C'mon! Just one!

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,250
No!

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,800
This is Nami-san's tangerine orchard!

42
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,390
I won't let anyone lay a finger on it!

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,190
Nami-san! Your love
security is infallible!

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,260
Yeah. Thanks, Sanji-kun.

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,280
Ol' Sanji's letting himself be used...

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,380
C'mon! Just one tangerine!

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,930
You're such a cheapskate, Sanji!

48
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,270
No!

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,390
Well, oh, well! I'm happy now, anyways!

50
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,310
The world sure is a turbulent place.
Another coup in Villa...

51
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,040
A flyer?

52
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,130
"Bounty! Straw Hat Luffy
Becomes Known to the World"

53
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,310
"Navy"

54
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,200
So, at the very least, they're now
too much for our branches to handle?

55
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes. Even before
forming his pirate group,

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,900
he defeated Navy Branch
Captain Axe-Hand Morgan,

57
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,330
and he's showed no signs
of slowing down since.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,510
Buggy the Clown, 15 million.

59
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,920
Pirate Fleet Commodore,
Don Krieg. 17 million.

60
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Fishman Pirate,
Saw-Tooth Arlong. 20 million.

61
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,170
These major pirates have all crossed
the big 10 million Berry mark

62
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,590
in the East Blue, where the average
bounty is 3 million Berries...

63
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,650
...but they've all been taken down.

64
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,330
30 million Berries as a starting
bounty is globally unprecedented,

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,830
but it is not an
excessively high amount.

66
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,830
It may be best to nip such
seeds of villainy early on,

67
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,030
before they have a
chance to get out of hand.

68
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,230
Absolutely.

69
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,710
Everyone who wants
to run away, do so now!

70
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,740
This bastion of peace will not tolerate
any weakness in this pirate age!

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,830
The public's weakness and feebleness
is not a sin! We have justice!

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,300
If there is tenacious evil on the seas,

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,530
then we, the Navy, must drive
it away with utmost force!

74
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,460
In the name of absolute justice!

75
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,520
"Justice"

76
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,540
Yes, sir!

77
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,770
Miss!

78
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
Miss Kaya!

79
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,720
Miss!

80
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,650
What's wrong, Merry?!

81
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,530
Have a look at this!

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,940
Usopp-san!

83
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,620
That's definitely Usopp-san
facing the other way!

84
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,980
Now that you
mention it, you're right...

85
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,920
Heya! You're looking
a lot better, Kaya!

86
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,630
What sort of story
shall I tell you today?

87
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,220
Usopp-san is moving toward his dreams!

88
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,050
I'm moving toward my dream of being
a doctor to help everyone, too!

89
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,620
I'm sure that someday, somewhere,

90
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,460
my dream and Usopp-san's
dream will come together!

91
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,840
"Chore Boy"

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,550
Finally... Finally... Finally!

93
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,380
Luffy-san! You've finally
set foot into your dream!

94
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm Luffy! The man who's
gonna be King of the Pirates!

95
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,910
See ya!

96
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,050
But the next time we meet,
we may be enemies!

97
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,840
Captain!

98
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm the one who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

99
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,590
We both have foolish dreams.

100
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,390
I'm doing it so I can
achieve my own goal.

101
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,260
Say... do you know the All Blue?

102
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,700
Thank you for all the damn things
you've done for me all these years!

103
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,250
We're wanted criminals now!

104
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,630
"Dead or alive"...
"30 million Berries"...?!

105
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
It says I'm 30 million Berries!

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,730
Look! I'm gonna be seen around
the world! Girls might fall for me!

107
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,330
What?! They put Long-nose
in but left me out?!

108
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,750
Where are you?!
I don't see you anywhere!

109
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,230
See!

110
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,910
It's just the back of your head.
That's nothing to brag about.

111
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,520
Don't be so glum!

112
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,230
You can get on these without being
captain if you get more important!

113
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,090
Seriously?!

114
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,190
Just keep on tryin' hard!

115
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,580
Let's rush into the Grand Line, men!

116
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,860
Yet again, you guys don't understand
the seriousness of the situation!

117
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,410
This means our lives are in danger now!

118
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,550
This is no time to be taking it easy
and relaxing in the East Blue...

119
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,420
30 million Berries...

120
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,580
At that amount, I bet
Headquarters will take action,

121
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,350
and strong bounty hunters
won't leave us alone...

122
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,400
They're gonna be on a completely
different level than everyone so far!

123
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,920
Let's go! Let's go! Grand Line!

124
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,410
Damn... Cheap booze
makes me feel sick...

125
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,130
How I long for the old days

126
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,000
when I was surrounded by
beautiful women and fine wine...

127
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,430
My one encounter with that
horrible waiter changed my fate...

128
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,440
Tarnishing the Navy's name lost
me my rank of Navy HQ Lieutenant

129
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,480
and put me in charge of this hunk
of junk in the middle of nowhere...

130
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,900
Former Lieutenant Fullbody!

131
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,280
Whadya want?! You're annoying!

132
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,520
I-I have a new wanted poster!

133
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh. Just leave it there.

134
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,590
I doubt it means anything to us,
seeing as we're all the way out--

135
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,170
This face... I've seen it
somewhere before...

136
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,240
I've never seen that pirate flag before.

137
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,330
I'm Iron Fist Fullbody,
Lieutenant at Navy Headquarters!

138
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,090
Who's your captain?! State your name!

139
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,920
I'm Luffy!

140
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,090
I'm Usopp!

141
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,600
We just made our pirate flag
the day before yesterday!

142
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,520
Yes! It's him!

143
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Thank you!

144
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,600
God has given me a chance to climb
out of this hellish pit of boredom!

145
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,950
I can catch that brat easily!

146
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,040
And I'll use that feat to get my
rank of Navy HQ Lieutenant back!

147
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,340
Fall in!

148
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,510
Men! We're going into battle!

149
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,880
Battle? Where are we gonna do that?

150
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,710
W-Well... The sea restaurant, I suppose?

151
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,760
Oh! A restaurant!

152
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
Awesome! A big feast!

153
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,780
It's the captain's treat!

154
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,260
Oh, really?!

155
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,030
Hurray! Hurray!

156
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,030
No, you got it all wrong!

157
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,740
That was...

158
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,480
Hard to port! Our target's
right in front of us!

159
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,910
Do you think some pirates
attacked it? That warship is scrapped...

160
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,080
It's not nice of the Navy to toss
its scrapped ships into the ocean...

161
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,960
This is not a scrapped ship!
Do you guys got knotholes for eyes?!

162
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,230
Have you forgotten what
Iron Fist Fullbody looks like?!

163
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,170
Oh! You're that navy
guy from sometime!

164
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,410
Are you stranded? Want us to help you?

165
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,510
Quit fooling around! Our meeting
here spells the end of your luck!

166
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,360
Monkey D. Luffy! You're under arrest!

167
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,210
Yeah! That's a good
picture of me, huh?!

168
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,950
And of the back of my head!

169
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,040
It says, "Dead or alive"...

170
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,420
Aim the turret!

171
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,250
What's all the noise? What's going on?

172
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,570
Oh? You're gonna shoot?

173
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,520
They're aiming right at us! This is bad!

174
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,770
Alright! Leave it to me!
I'll bounce it back again!

175
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,870
Luffy. Let me handle this one.

176
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,710
Yeah, yeah! You stay back here!

177
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,710
H-How come?

178
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,850
'Cause you mess things up.
C'mon! Over here!

179
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,650
Tremble and sleep!

180
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,370
Awesome!

181
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,340
That's impossible!

182
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,290
Huh? What's all this damn noise?

183
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,290
Don't bother people
when they're napping.

184
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,510
There's plenty more
where that came from! Fire!

185
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,620
Huh? This is bad.

186
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,580
It is?!

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,090
See? There were cracks in the cannon.

188
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,690
Yeah, that's definitely bad.

189
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,290
You damn brats!

190
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,090
Don't you dare mock the power
of a former Navy HQ Lieutenant!

191
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,170
We'll just have to
fight you hand-to-hand!

192
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,140
Men! Follow me!

193
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,250
Your head is mine!

194
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,760
Gum-Gum...

195
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,800
...Bell!

196
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,810
You got some real balls, pickin'
a fight during mealtime, tough guy.

197
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,300
Don't got any soup bowls today.

198
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,160
You plannin' to lick
the deck or somethin'?

199
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,310
W-What's that waiter doing here?!

200
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,530
Huh? He's done already?

201
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,080
He was nothing but talk!

202
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,270
He's as damn wimpy as ever.

203
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,760
C'mon, you guys! Keep it down!

204
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,730
Honestly! I can't even relax
and read a newspaper here!

205
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,160
Nami-san! I'm finished
preparing your meal!

206
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,220
Ooh! I'm starving!
Let's eat! Food! Food!

207
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,820
What's that?

208
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,120
Lemme see.

209
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,960
Hawk-Eye! Why the hell are you here?!

210
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,590
Calm down. I have no business with you.

211
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,940
Where is your leader?

212
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,260
Camping on an island like this...
What a carefree man.

213
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,210
B-B-Boss!

214
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,290
H-H-Hawk-Eye!

215
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,510
Hey there, Hawk-Eye.
What a rare visitor...

216
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,720
I'm not feelin' so good at the moment...
Have you come to fight me?

217
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,410
I don't have any intention
of settling things with you

218
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,410
now that you've lost your left arm.

219
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,770
I found an interesting pirate,

220
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,030
and was suddenly reminded
of a story you used to tell.

221
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,480
A story about an interesting boy
from a certain small village...

222
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,240
You don't mean...!

223
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,910
So you've made it, Luffy!

224
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,680
In that case, Hawk-Eye...

225
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,330
...I can't just let you leave now.

226
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,380
That so, Hawk-Eye?!

227
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Okay! Drink up! Drink up!
Today's a celebration!

228
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,590
I thought you had a hangover?

229
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,030
Don't sweat it!
It's a celebratory drink!

230
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,400
C'mon, now! C'mon, now!

231
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,080
Just drink it straight down!

232
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,200
I like ya!
Let's drink! Let's drink!

233
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,300
Yeah!

234
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,180
But, wait! Boss! You said you felt
sick 'cause you drank too much!

235
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,580
You idiot! I can't not drink
on a joyous day like today!

236
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,880
The sun is still high.

237
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,380
Don't sweat it!

238
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,210
Let's party hard!

239
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,230
Hey! Luffy's a wanted man now!

240
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,160
Good for him!

241
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,260
Who knows, maybe a great pirate
will've come from this village!

242
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,530
That'd be great!

243
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,440
Quiet, you fools!

244
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,900
Mayor!

245
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,230
What's so good about a criminal
coming from our village?!

246
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,090
A toast!

247
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,230
Honestly! Every last one of them...!

248
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,330
Look, Mayor! Luffy looks so happy!

249
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,880
A pirate's a pirate!

250
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!

251
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,140
But it is his dream. Are you worried?

252
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,430
Dreams... Fate...

253
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,380
We're finally nearing the Grand Line...

254
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,360
It looks like the only way into it
is through Reverse Mountain here.

255
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,310
What a pain.
Can't we just sail straight into it?

256
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,020
Nope.

257
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,750
From what the geezer told me,
that's the only way boats can enter.

258
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,060
How come?

259
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,500
'Cause it's supposedly dangerous.

260
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,270
But how come?!

261
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,470
I don't know any more than that!

262
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,000
The reason for that is...

263
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,060
Alright! I got it!
Then let's head straight into it!

264
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,880
Are you even paying attention?!

265
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,690
But it sounds fun!

266
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,150
Plus it'd feel way better
going straight into it!

267
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,680
Talking to you makes me
feel like I'm gonna go crazy...

268
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Anyways, let's stop at
an island first and get meat!

269
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,650
Meat! Meat!

270
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,120
There's a famous city on
this island... Loguetown.

271
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,200
Loguetown?

272
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
What? Is it famous for its meat?

273
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,050
Also known as the city
of the beginning and the end...

274
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,790
I'm pretty sure I've heard that before.

275
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,980
It's the town where Gold Roger,
the old King of the Pirates,

276
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,770
was born... and executed.

277
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,750
The town where the
King of the Pirates died...

278
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,690
Wanna go?

279
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,980
Yeah! I wanna see it!

280
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,750
I wanna see the town where
the man who got the One Piece--

281
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,220
everything this world has to offer--

282
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,180
was born and then died!

283
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

284
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

285
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

286
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

287
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

288
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

289
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

290
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

291
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

292
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

293
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

294
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,380
Hey! What's that
red-nosed thing called again?

295
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,310
A reindeer?

296
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,730
No, that guy with the big nose!

297
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,150
Oh, him.

298
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,420
His name was Boogey or Baggy
the Brown or something like that!

299
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,650
No! Buggy the Clown! Buggy!

300
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,520
Yeah! That!

301
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,020
I wonder what
happened to him after that...

302
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,990
On the next episode of One Piece!

303
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,290
"Chase Straw Hat!
Little Buggy's Big Adventure"

304
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,490
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
