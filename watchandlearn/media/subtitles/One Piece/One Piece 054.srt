00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,710
It's a "guiding light." The entrance to
the Grand Line lies ahead of that light.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,050
In order to find the All Blue!

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,470
In order to be King of the Pirates!

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,310
In order to become
a master swordsman!

25
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,940
In order to draw a world map!

26
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,910
I-In order...

27
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,660
...to become a brave warrior of the sea!

28
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,830
We're going...

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,530
...to the Grand Line!

30
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,150
"Precursor to a New Adventure!
Apis, a Mysterious Girl"

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,660
Hey, it's meal time.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,370
Hm?

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,640
She's gone?! Hey! Where're you?!
Where're you hiding?!

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,510
Hey! It's no use!
It's storming outside!

35
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,600
Just come out!

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,130
Ouch!

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,440
Ow, ow, ow...

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,390
Hey!

39
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,930
I'm telling you, you can't escape.

40
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,450
If you stay put, we won't
do anything to you.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,330
No! Let me go!

42
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,840
What're you doing?!

43
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,220
Hey, calm down!

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
What?! What?!

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,780
The girl escaped!

46
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,320
Search the whole ship!

47
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,370
Take her into custody
as soon as you find her!

48
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,630
She's still a child.
Don't be rough on her!

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,030
Ow, ow, ow...

50
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,050
There she is!

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,930
Capture her!

52
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,650
Hey! Hold it!

53
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,340
It's dangerous!

54
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,750
Come down!

55
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,320
We can't have the sail
unfurled like that in this storm!

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,650
Please protect me, Grandpa Ryu.

57
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,020
Wh-What're you going to do?!

58
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,770
Ahhh! It's dangerous! Stop it!

59
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,680
Idiots! What is this report?!

60
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,130
That girl may be a clue to the Dragonite
that I've spent years searching for!

61
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,460
Don't you realize how serious this is?!

62
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,550
Y-Yes, sir!

63
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,260
Eric!

64
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,220
I've been here all along.

65
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't lose a clue to the elixir of
immortality after I've finally found it.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,250
Go join my fleet and find her
no matter what it takes.

67
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,070
With all due respect,

68
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,110
tracking down someone
wasn't in the contract.

69
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll pay you however much you want.

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,270
I hired you for a time like this.

71
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,800
Losing a clue now will be a blow
for you as well, will it not?

72
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,080
Now, go!

73
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,230
Understood, Your Excellency,
Commodore Nelson Royal.

74
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,600
Nami! Aren't we in the Grand Line yet?

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,310
We just left Loguetown two days ago.

76
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,760
It'll take a few more days.
Wait a little longer.

77
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,950
Okay!

78
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,980
What nice weather!

79
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,210
That storm seems like a dream.

80
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,040
Hm...?

81
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,190
What the heck is that?

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,630
Hey! I see a flock of birds to starboard!

83
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,670
A flock of birds?

84
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah.

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,340
I also see something
kind of big on the water...

86
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
I can't see it well.
I wonder what it is.

87
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,090
Maybe a fish?

88
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,310
A small boat...?

89
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,510
It could be a big fish, too, but...

90
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,280
I often hear that
seabirds flock above fish.

91
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,980
Fish?!

92
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,150
Luffy! Let's have them for lunch.

93
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,160
Alrighty!

94
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,480
Gum-Gum...

95
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,810
Grab!

96
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,960
Whoa! Now that's a stretch!

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,300
His body sure is convenient.

98
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,920
I caught it!

99
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,810
It's pretty big!

100
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,600
Nice, Luffy!

101
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,630
H-Hold on a second...
What're you gonna do now?

102
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,190
Oh... Sorry, Zoro.

103
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,300
Dumbass!!

104
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,780
I'm gonna... cut him down... someday...

105
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,070
Hey, look. That's no fish.

106
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,660
It's a girl!

107
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,610
Oh? Is she a fishperson?
Where's her web?

108
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,520
You idiot. Just how does
she look like a fishperson?

109
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,400
Why was a little girl in
a small boat like that...?

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Ouch!

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,570
So you've come to?

112
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,440
Seems you're doing
better than I expected.

113
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,090
Does it hurt anywhere?

114
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,840
You must be hungry.
I'm cooking soup right now.

115
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,220
Lucky!

116
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,030
Were you in a ship wreck or something?

117
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,790
You could've been in big trouble.
What's your name?

118
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,460
When you ask someone questions,
you should give your name first.

119
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,200
Good point. My name is Nami.

120
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,420
The one who's cooking soup
in the kitchen is Sanji.

121
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,910
Hi!

122
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,820
The one with a scary face
wearing a bellyband is Zoro.

123
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,710
Shut up.

124
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,650
The one who's unconscious
over there is Usopp. And...

125
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,470
I'm Luffy. I'm the captain
of this pirate ship.

126
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,300
What?!

127
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,920
Pirates?!

128
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,460
We're heading to the Grand Line.

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,730
What's wrong?

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
She isn't moving.

131
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,430
What're we gonna do with this kid?

132
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,230
Ahhh, well, what should we do?

133
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,190
Let's think about it tomorrow.

134
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,980
Why?!

135
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,020
Why? Why? Why? Why in the heck?!

136
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,620
I went through all that trouble and did
scary things to escape from the Navy!

137
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,370
Of all things, why did I get
picked up by a pirate ship?

138
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,030
This isn't funny!

139
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,630
In any case, I'll think about
it after I eat something.

140
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,130
Ouch...

141
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,980
You again?

142
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,370
You never learn no matter
how many times I tell you, Luffy.

143
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,950
Can't you get it
through your thick skull?

144
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,940
Hm? What're you doing?

145
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,880
Yum!

146
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,830
If you ask, I'll make something for you.

147
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,160
So, like I told you,
don't take food without asking.

148
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,460
But I'm hungry.

149
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,840
What's wrong? Aren't you eating?

150
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,060
You didn't eat this afternoon, either.

151
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,740
Why're you holding back?

152
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,270
I'm telling ya, it's not
poisoned or anything.

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,280
If you just sit there like that,
he'll finish everything.

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
If you're not eating, I'll eat it!

155
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,410
No!

156
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,180
Huh?

157
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,020
Yum!!

158
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,360
Of course! Sanji's the cook I picked!

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,650
I've never eaten anything this good!

160
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,050
You're finally smiling.

161
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,110
Oh, Nami-san!

162
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
You're eating again, Luffy?!

163
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,600
I didn't eat that much for lunch.

164
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,040
You emptied two pots, didn't you?

165
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,140
I did?

166
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,710
You got scared when you heard
we're pirates, didn't you?

167
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,250
W-Well...

168
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,570
Well, that's a natural reaction
towards pirates these days.

169
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,720
You're not gonna sell me off?

170
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,260
No way!

171
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,200
You're all evil-looking, so...

172
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,860
You've got a right
to talk with that face?

173
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,350
What're you doing?!

174
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,520
Ahh! That's enough!

175
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,810
We have more, mademoiselle.

176
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,190
At least, this ship isn't the kind
of pirate ship you're thinking of.

177
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,120
Don't worry.

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,970
Another plate, please!

179
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,790
As you wish.

180
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,380
Me, too!

181
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,490
Do it yourself!

182
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,970
You meanie...

183
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,240
Wo-oah!

184
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,500
Huh?

185
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,950
Wh-What happened?

186
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,130
Hey! Just what'd you do?

187
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,840
I was preparing a meal!

188
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,660
What?

189
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,370
Everyone! Breakfast is ready!

190
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,390
Oh, breakfast?!

191
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,250
What breakfast explodes?

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,830
You made this?

193
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,670
Yep!

194
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,880
It has quite... a unique appearance...

195
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,780
Thanks! I'm digging in!

196
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,010
In addition to rescuing me,
you're feeding me, too.

197
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll do anything to help you from now on!

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,560
Uh... uhm...

199
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,680
That'll be helpful... Thank you.

200
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,940
Is this really edible?

201
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,770
Stop grumbling and just eat it!

202
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,950
But seriously, is it really safe to eat?

203
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,900
Really? This is good.

204
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,300
That's right. It's possible that
just the appearance is bad.

205
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,670
Really?

206
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,070
W-Was it that bad?

207
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,250
Whoa! That's spicy!

208
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,420
What is this?!
I put in the wrong seasoning!

209
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,860
Well, that's a common mistake.

210
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,210
You'll be fine if you
are careful next time.

211
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,990
Hey, she took the trouble
to prepare it for us.

212
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,340
Eat every crumb!

213
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,940
Shut up! Don't waste this
girl's kindness. This girl's...

214
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,550
Oh, what's your name, by the way?

215
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,870
Apis! My name is Apis!

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,340
Apis-chan put her heart into this food!

217
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,810
Plus, I won't allow anyone to waste food!

218
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,420
I'll cook something
for you later, Nami-san.

219
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,380
Thanks.

220
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:07,020
I'm sorry. I'm not good at cooking...
but I wanted to be helpful!

221
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,410
Don't worry about it.
We really appreciate the thought.

222
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,630
Leave the cooking to me.

223
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,230
There're many other things
that you could help out with.

224
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,240
Okay!

225
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,690
Really? This is good.

226
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,970
You...

227
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,370
I wanna eat barbecue next.
I haven't had it for a while.

228
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,390
Say, why were you
drifting on the sea, Apis?

229
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,650
I escaped from a Navy ship...

230
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,650
From a Navy ship?

231
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,660
...during the stormy
night three days ago...

232
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,460
In that small boat in such a storm...

233
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,900
You're reckless.

234
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,330
So what'd you do in the first place?

235
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,650
You had to escape,

237
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,450
which means you weren't on
their ship as a guest, right?

238
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,030
But then the Navy wouldn't
go after every little villain.

239
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,790
W-Well... uhm...

240
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
What? Are you a super villain?

241
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,480
No! There's no way I'd do bad things!

242
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,690
I never did bad things...
but I can't tell you why...

243
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,120
What's that about...?

244
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,960
What's the big deal?
She must have her reasons.

245
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,230
If she doesn't want to say,
then we shouldn't press her.

246
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,800
That's true. But can you at
least tell us where you're from?

247
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,870
What? Oh, yes...

248
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,020
I'm from Warship Island.

249
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,630
Warship Island?

250
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,480
Do you know it?

251
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,310
No. I'll check it out.

252
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,650
Why is it called Warship Island?

253
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,980
It's because the shape of the
island looks exactly like a warship.

254
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,990
Oh, that's interesting.

255
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,280
Ahh! This is the one!

256
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,170
Oh, it's close to the Grand Line.

257
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,120
We're around here right now,
so it's not that far.

258
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,390
What do you wanna do?

259
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,000
What?

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,960
Do you wanna go
back to Warship Island?

261
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,130
If we keep sailing like this,
we are going to enter the Grand Line.

262
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,720
You were nice enough to save me
and I feel bad burdening you further...

263
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,680
but I want to go back to the island!
I'm sorry. I'm selfish, aren't I?

264
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,820
If you hand me to a ship heading
west on your way if possible,

265
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,550
I'll work things out on my own.

266
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,960
Oh my, that's a real burden!

267
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,360
There's no way that a pirate ship can
get close to another ship so easily.

268
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,420
Yeah, you're right.

269
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,540
But since it's not totally out of our way

270
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,640
and we're not really in a hurry...

271
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,700
Oh, what the heck?

272
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,120
What?!

273
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,970
It doesn't matter either way to me.
What should we do, Captain?

274
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,150
Yeah, that sounds fine.

275
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,780
The Grand Line isn't
that far, either, so...

276
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,760
I see. The island looks
like a warship, huh?

277
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,150
Sounds like they've decided.

278
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,320
Really?!

279
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,660
Are you really going to stop
by Warship Island for me?!

280
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,220
Yeah.

281
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,060
All right! Thank you, Luffy!

282
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,990
All right! All right! I'm so happy!

283
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,490
Thank you very much! Thank you!

284
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,160
Thank you very much, everyone!

285
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,840
To show my appreciation,
I'll prepare lots of dishes every day!

286
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
No, that won't be necessary.

287
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,870
Why not?

288
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,820
Reporting!

289
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,950
Ship sighted ahead at 13 o'clock!

290
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,690
It's a mid-size caravel.

291
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,060
I see a flag with a skull
mark on the main mast!

292
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,140
Pirates, huh?

293
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,930
They don't know their own station,
sailing around in the seas

294
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,180
under Commodore Nelson's control.

295
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,610
I'm sure they're just small fries.
Just leave them alone!

296
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,750
No. That flag doesn't
belong to small fries.

297
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,310
If I remember correctly,
that belongs to Straw Hat Luffy,

298
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,310
a man with a 30 million Berry
bounty on his head.

299
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,490
Oh, the ones people have
been talking about lately?

300
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,980
We still can't find the girl
even with this big fleet.

301
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,160
It's possible that someone has her.

302
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,810
Not to mention, pirates of that caliber...

303
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,610
Isn't it going to be a problem if you
leave them be, Lt. Commander?

304
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Capture that ship!

305
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,670
I wonder what this feeling is...

306
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,110
Hey! I see ships
approaching from the rear!

307
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,800
What?

308
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,810
Ugh! Oh, man!

309
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,500
They're Navy ships!

310
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,280
Navy?!

311
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,090
And it's not just
one or two ships, either!

312
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,990
He's right!

313
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,620
But what's a fleet like that doing here?

314
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,170
What? What? What's going on?

315
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,760
Are they after my head?

316
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,630
That's a lot even for that!

317
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,820
It means that they need that
many to capture me, right?

318
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,130
I'm amazing, aren't I?

319
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,260
How can you be so easygoing?!

320
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,840
Hm...? What's wrong?

321
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,440
Those ships belong to Branch 8!

322
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,520
I escaped from them!

323
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,110
What am I gonna do?

324
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,520
Hm...? There! I found her!
I see the girl on their deck!

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,650
What?!

326
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,320
It was just as I said,
wasn't it, Lt. Commander?

327
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,570
Did I hurt your pride?

328
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,280
But if you make a mistake
and lose that girl...

329
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,780
...the clue to the elixir
of immortality, the Dragonite,

330
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,310
I wonder how furious
Commodore Nelson would get.

331
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,040
Prepare the main cannons!
We'll capture that pirate ship!

332
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,550
Ugh! They're firing at us!!

333
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,290
Attention pirate ship!
Stop the ship immediately!

334
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,130
Those were warning shots.
The next shots will hit your ship!

335
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,930
There's no way we'd stop!

336
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,630
What're we gonna do, Luffy? If you
wanna take 'em on, I'm with you.

337
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,610
Yeah. Why don't we?

338
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,530
Ahhh! W-Wait a sec!

339
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,970
Why are you guys always like this?!

340
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,640
What the heck are you
gonna do against that fleet?!

341
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,640
Apis, go to the cabin downstairs.

342
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,410
We'll make a raid on them.

343
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,410
O-Okay...

344
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,970
A raid isn't gonna work!

345
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,930
We'll make it work.

346
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,470
You can't!

347
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,460
We're not saying you have to come.
Back us up with the cannon.

348
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,960
What? So I'm staying on this ship?
Okay, leave it to me!

349
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,810
Hey, Apis. What's the matter?

350
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,810
And we'll get clear
of them at full speed!

351
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,920
He said a wind is coming.

352
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,920
You take care of the rest.

353
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,090
A strong wind is...

354
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,480
Zoro! Lean the sail towards the south!

355
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,470
Usopp and Sanji-kun,
right rudder full! Hurry up!

356
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,780
O-Okay.

357
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes, Nami-san!

358
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,740
What's going on?

359
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,730
A gust is coming.
We'll ride it and get out of here.

360
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,030
If we fight them head on,
we'll lose no matter how good we are.

361
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,780
We can take them, though...

362
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,500
This girl...

363
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,050
Their ship shows no signs of stopping.

364
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,580
They're mocking us!

365
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,910
Here goes!

366
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,280
Ahh! The pirate ship sped up
and changed its route!

367
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,250
What?!

368
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,650
They're heading south!

369
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,660
South?! How foolish!

370
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,590
Do they know what's in that direction?!

371
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,220
What're you doing, Lt. Commander?!
Go after them! Now!

372
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,170
Whoa! This is fast!
This is a good wind.

373
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,450
Look at that, Luffy!
The Navy's falling behind!

374
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,070
Whoa!

375
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,230
Ha! You guys're slow turtles!

376
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,330
No good! We can't catch up!

377
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,820
A Navy fleet falling behind
such a small ship? Dimwit.

378
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,170
A small ship has better mobility!

379
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,120
I don't wanna hear excuses!

380
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,960
Lt. Commander, this ship will soon...

381
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,760
Lt. Commander!

382
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,570
I know!

383
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,000
Stop all the ships!
Prepare to turn around!

384
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,670
Wait, Lt. Commander!
Why are you stopping the ships?

385
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,900
If we keep going,
we'll go into the Calm Belt!

386
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,780
So what? Go after them!

387
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,250
No!

388
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,120
You really don't appreciate the
seriousness of this matter, do you?

389
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,650
We can't lose that girl now.

390
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,190
What're you going to say
to Commodore Nelson?!

391
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm prepared to take the punishment.

392
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,190
I can't just sit by and let this fleet

393
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,310
and my subordinates
be swallowed by the sea!

394
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,280
No matter what you say,
the chase ends here!

395
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,520
How... foolish...

396
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,970
The Navy isn't following us!

397
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,900
Did Captain Usopp
scare the pants off them?

398
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,080
Amazing! Amazing! Just as
you'd expect from our navigator!

399
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,980
Well done, Nami-san. To think you
detected such a wind beforehand...

400
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, it was like an instinct, though.

401
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,650
Oh, Nami-san is lovely
when she's humble, too.

402
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,250
Well then, shall we head
straight to Warship Island?

403
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,460
Really?!

404
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,350
Yeah, really.

405
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,990
Okay, then! To Warship Island, let's...

406
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,810
...go!!

407
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,380
What's wrong, Zoro?

408
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,840
You've had a serious look
on your face for a while.

409
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,330
Well, I hope it's just my imagination.

410
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,340
What is?

411
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,010
I feel like this ship hasn't
been moving at all for a while.

412
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,830
What?

413
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,800
Come to think of it, the sail
isn't catching any wind at all...

414
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
Ah!

415
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,360
What's wrong, Nami?

416
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,680
Nami-san...?

417
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,420
Dammit...

418
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,530
We've entered the Calm Belt!!

419
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

420
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

421
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

422
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

423
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

424
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

425
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

426
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

427
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

428
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

429
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

430
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,810
What's the Calm Belt?

431
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,480
We'll head straight to Warship Island!

432
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,650
Ahhh!

433
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,820
He always makes us do reckless things!

434
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,990
Say, don't you think Apis
has an air of secrecy about her?

435
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,320
Hey, look at that!
Something incredible's there!

436
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,660
Th-That's...!

437
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,990
On the next episode on One Piece!

438
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,330
"Miraculous Creature! Apis's Secret
and the Legendary Island."

439
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
