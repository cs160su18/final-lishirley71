2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,900
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,240
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,530
You're going to kick my butt?

48
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,970
Yeah, you heard me!

49
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,440
But considering your level of strength,
you couldn't even lay a hand on me!

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,010
Brick Bat.

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,480
Gatling!

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,350
Damn it! He's blocking all of my punches.

53
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,860
Ow, ow!

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,880
Ow, ow, ow!

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,250
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,980
Don't follow me!

57
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,710
Wait, Horo-Horo Chick!

58
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,210
Stop him, Kumacy!

59
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,800
Don't mess with Perona-sama!

60
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,630
I had no idea that stuffed animal
was so nimble and powerful!

61
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,020
And here he can't even reach
the zipper on his back!

62
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,070
Why, you...!

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,080
Skip! Skip! Skip!

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,790
Nami-san!

65
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,750
Get your grubby hands off her!

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,460
Sorry to have kept your waiting,
Nami-san. Your knight is here.

67
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,370
I'm in a foul mood right now.

68
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,090
I don't have time to deal with weaklings like--

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,300
Shut up, Fur Face!

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,390
Absalom-sama!

71
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,350
Basses Côte!

72
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,810
You said that you were in a foul mood?

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,690
That doesn't begin to describe mine.

74
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
I'm so mad I feel like my body could explode!

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,750
And unfortunately for you, there is bad
blood between us over one other thing!

76
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,370
"A Clear-Clear History? Sanji's Stolen Dream"

77
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,350
A-Absalom-sama...

78
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,780
You... and I... have bad blood?

79
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,290
That's right. You are the man
who stole one of my dreams!

80
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,330
A-A dream...?

81
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,330
Doesn't ring any bells.

82
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,130
There must be some sort of misunderstanding.

83
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,760
You and I...

84
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,970
...met for the first time today!

85
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm going to send you flying...

86
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,380
...with my Hands of the Dead!

87
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,360
Take them off.

88
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,660
I said to drop the bazookas
attached to your arms.

89
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,120
Wha--?!

90
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,810
Do I need to spell it out?

91
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,520
If Nami-san gets hurt
because you went overboard,

92
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,720
no one will be able to tell you were ever
alive by the time I'm through with you!

93
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,350
He couldn't possibly know
what I've got up my sleeves!

94
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,310
I said to lose the bazookas!

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,370
Wow! A bazooka magically materialized!

96
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,720
Yeah, that's about what I thought.

97
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,290
It seemed like the type of attack
you would come up with.

98
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,630
You can make yourself invisible.

99
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,540
While in that state, you can make
anything you touch go invisible as well.

100
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,030
That is your current ability.

101
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,260
Invisible man born of the Clear-Clear Fruit,

102
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,180
I know every possible move you could make!

103
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,640
Who the hell are you...?!

104
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,660
Has that man met Absalom-sama
somewhere before?

105
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,310
Why does he know his powers inside and out?

106
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,400
What could this "bad blood" possibly be?

107
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,570
Back when I was a kid, I read an
encyclopedia on the Devil Fruit.

108
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,160
I had no interest in a shady object that
would make the ocean grow to hate you.

109
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,010
But there was one and one
alone that caught my interest.

110
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,530
I decided that in the unlikely
event I came across that Fruit,

111
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,680
I would eat it, even if it meant
losing the ability to swim!

112
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,250
But there aren't two identical
Devil Fruits at the same time!

113
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,560
If I ran into someone with that ability,
my dream would go up in smoke!

114
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,780
Now do you get it? I wanted
to become an invisible man!

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,920
That's why I said that you've
crushed one of my dreams,

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,240
since you ate the Clear-Clear Fruit!

117
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,580
He's venting?!

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,990
I put a lot of thought into my dream!

119
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,410
If I ate the Fruit, I'd use my
abilities to watch women bathe!

120
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,990
No! Just think of all the things I could
use it for. I could... watch women bathe!

121
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,300
No! Just imagine how I could help others.
I could... watch women bathe!

122
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,760
All you're really thinking about is
how you could watch women bathe!

123
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,470
Shut up! After long years
of imagining what I'd do,

124
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,730
I am fully aware of what I could see--

125
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,810
no, what I could accomplish with that ability!

126
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,260
Between this and endangering Nami-san,

127
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,560
you have compounded
transgression upon transgression,

128
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,730
making it impossible to forgive you!

129
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,450
Prepare to wave goodbye to watching
women bathe--no, to your life!

130
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,790
I was wondering what your problem was!

131
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,670
You're picking a fight over the stupidest thing!

132
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,480
Y-Your complaint is beyond absurd!

133
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,090
It certainly is.

134
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,380
You're a freaking pervert!

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,740
You're not one to talk!

136
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,600
He has a point!

137
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,930
But they're equally bad!

138
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,490
Have it your way!

139
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,200
I will throw your sudden claim of
bad blood and rage right back at you!

140
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,420
The lion muzzle wasn't my only transplant!

141
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,210
Elephant skin!

142
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,880
300kg of compact bear and gorilla muscle!

143
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,410
Dr. Hogback has conducted one
transplant after the next on this body,

144
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,210
allowing me to become the
ultimate beastly masterpiece!

145
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,270
The Clear-Clear Fruit's ability is a mere bonus.

146
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,270
Next to my strength, it's nothing
more than an accessory.

147
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,630
Get it?

148
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,780
But...

149
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,150
You still peeped!

150
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,410
You're absolutely right!

151
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,880
If a normal person kicked me,
my body would break his leg...

152
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,390
But he's kicking me like I'm a normal man...!

153
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,430
Regardless, I will be the last one laughing!

154
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,870
I have claimed the power you so desired!

155
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,230
And the woman you longed to
protect is about to become my wife!

156
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,690
I could not imagine a more bitter defeat!

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,950
When he abducted her,
Nami vanished with him.

158
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,280
We lost his trail after that!

159
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,120
You wanna make Nami-san go invisible!

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,610
But you can't have her!

161
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,600
Where do you think you're looking?

162
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,210
You're wasting your energy!
It's time I showed you...

163
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,350
...the power of a Phantom!

164
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,990
What's this? You're going to
sacrifice yourself for that woman?

165
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,750
Protect her! Assuming you've got what it takes!

166
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,880
Phantom Hand!

167
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,290
Phantom Leg!

168
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,500
I wouldn't drop that woman if I were you!

169
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,080
Damn beast!

170
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,120
Sorry, Nami-san...

171
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,720
You dropped her! I guess you didn't
value her as much as your own life.

172
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,570
I'm sorry...

173
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,450
I can't soil your pure
white dress with my blood...

174
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,460
Damn invisible man, sneaking around!

175
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,060
I'm totally over my dream now!

176
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,170
I don't care if I can't turn invisible anymore!

177
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,430
I'll peep without any special powers!

178
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,100
You're still going to peep?!

179
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,380
Let go, bastard!

180
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,050
Unhand me!

181
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm not about to let go, you sick beast!

182
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,350
If you're a mix of a bunch of animals,
I bet you'll make lovely mincemeat!

183
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,300
Shut up, jerk!

184
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,190
Let go of me!

185
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,660
Extra Haché!

186
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,550
Absalom-sama!

187
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,660
A beast should be satisfied
with watching women bathe--

188
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,420
Scratch that! With a beastly bride.

189
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

190
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,590
Let go of me!

191
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,550
Ow, that hurts!

192
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,510
--Ow, ow, ow! L-Let go!
--Don't worry. They won't suck your blood.

193
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,140
What was that about
kicking my butt? What a joke!

194
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,240
Get away from me!

195
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,390
Your lack of experience is going
to make you humiliate yourself

196
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,960
when you underestimate others, greenhorn.

197
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,170
Damn it! Gum-Gum...

198
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,920
Brick Bat!

199
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,680
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

200
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

201
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,400
Gum-Gum...

202
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,030
...Gatling!

203
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,510
You jerk! Now I'm ticked!

204
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,220
Gum-Gum...

205
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,680
Why did you jump over the rail?
Trying to run away?

206
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,100
...Stamp!

207
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,820
That hurt, brat!

208
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,740
Take that! So much for me not being
able to touch you, Giant Shallot!

209
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,520
He's still in hot pursuit!

210
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,020
If he was out of the picture,
I could take down the other pirates!

211
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,860
Stupid Mr. Negative Nose!

212
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,030
He's still chasing after me!

213
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,460
If he was out of the picture, I could
take down that Horo-Horo Chick!

214
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,860
Stupid bear zombie!

215
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,120
Wait!

216
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,870
Stay away!

217
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,790
Wait, Horo-Horo Chick!

218
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,590
Stay away! Kumacy, hurry and finish him off!

219
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,850
Wait!

220
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,770
Horo-Horo Chick!

221
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Kumacy!

222
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,070
Don't you dare harm Perona-sama!

223
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,070
That was close! Too close!

224
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,790
Perona-sama!

225
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,670
Scary!

226
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,800
No!

227
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,550
Sweet!

228
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,250
Why is that stuffed animal
so freakishly strong?!

229
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,790
Wait! Wait!

230
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,340
Oh, yeah!

231
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,670
Eat this! Special Attack! Flame Ball!

232
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,640
Yikes, this is bad! It's fire!

233
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Fire!

234
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,140
It worked! It totally worked!

235
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,130
A zombie is still a zombie!

236
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,980
And with this oil, I'll cast the
"You Cannot Cross This Point" spell!

237
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,010
What?!

238
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,740
Dumbbear! Now you can't come after me.

239
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,020
This makes me invincible.

240
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,080
If I don't have to worry about you,
that Horo-Horo Chick will be a pushover!

241
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,190
I, like, rule!

242
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,620
Now then, I think I might teach
that Horo-Horo Chick a lesson,

243
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,470
since she's weaker than me!

244
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,810
Huh? Where did she go?

245
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,590
Over here, Mr. Negative Nose.

246
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,900
Huh? I don't see you.

247
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,240
Could she be outside?

248
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,890
No, she couldn't be out there...

249
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,080
We're up on a really high fl--whoa!

250
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:54,170
D-Dang! Why are you flying?!
I thought you could only control ghosts!

251
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,060
Wh-What exactly is your power?!

252
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,180
Don't underestimate the power
of the Ghost Princess, moron!

253
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,350
I just figured out how I'm
going to take you down.

254
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,240
Once I knock you off,
the others will be easy pickings!

255
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait a sec! This is not what I was expecting!

256
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,720
What's wrong? You haven't
landed a single attack on me.

257
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,950
Just a sec! See, I can attack
by sniping, being negative,

258
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,850
bluffing, and, uh, using my 8,000 subordinates!

259
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,710
Man, I'm screwed! Why doesn't any
of it work on that Horo-Horo Chick?

260
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,230
What should I do? What now?!

261
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,840
On the next episode of One Piece!

262
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,980
"Save Me, Hero!! My Enemy
Is the Immortal Princess!"

263
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,130
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
