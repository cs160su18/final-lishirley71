Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

WE GO!

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,050
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,290
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,580
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,020
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,990
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

79
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,260
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,890
After receiving an emergency signal,
they landed on Punk Hazard Island.

81
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
It was a strange island divided

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,040
into two parts; the Burning
Lands and the Ice Lands.

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,910
To rescue Nami and the others
who are held captive,

84
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,580
Luffy's group headed to the Ice Lands.

85
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,550
But they were unaware that some

86
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,270
former acquaintances were also on the island.

87
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,640
What brought you here - to my vacation home?

88
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,020
White Chase-ya!

89
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,120
"The Warlord! Trafalgar Law!"

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,660
Trafalgar! I know you're a Warlord but
we need you to ask you to step aside.

91
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,980
Move out of the way!

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,070
We know somebody else is here on the island!

93
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,750
INSIDE OF DR. VEGAPUNK'S FORMER
LABORATORY NAMI'S GROUP

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,150
Dad! Mom!

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,170
Hey, you said "We are not sick
anymore" earlier, didn't you?

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,300
Uh-huh.

97
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,920
What kind of sickness did you have?

98
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,320
None of you look sick to me.

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,310
I don't know. But they
told us that we were sick

100
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,510
and we'd get better in a year.

101
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,110
Get better in a year?

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,550
Uh-huh.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,740
And people who were asked

104
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,490
to treat me by my dad and
mom took me to this place.

105
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,080
That means your parents
sent you to this place?

106
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,830
Not really, those people told
me that out of the blue in

107
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,850
front of my house and took me here.

108
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,870
They said they didn't want my
dad and mom to get infected.

109
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,590
So I couldn't even say goodbye.

110
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,960
That's what happened to you all?

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,010
--Un-huh.
--Me too.

112
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,790
No way! It seems they were kidnapped!

113
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,460
Some strangers took them here

114
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,520
without letting them see their parents?

115
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,440
That could only mean...

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,020
...you're really very sick!

117
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,470
What are you, stupid?!

118
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,600
Are you all doing okay?

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,700
If any of you can't run,
I'll carry you on my back.

120
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,250
They all look fine.

121
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,560
Yes, we are! The Master has been treating us.

122
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,690
The Master?

123
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,500
Uh-huh, the Master.

124
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,920
Master!

125
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,090
--Master!
--Master!

126
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,630
But it's been over a year, hasn't it?

127
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,650
Chopper, why don't you examine them later?

128
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,440
Yeah, okay.

129
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,990
Oh no! This door is locked!
We have nowhere to go!

130
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,970
What?

131
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,000
--They are coming!
--What are you gonna do?

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,510
I have to hurry!

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,710
Nami, step aside!

134
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,260
One more! Hi-ya!

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,890
It's open. Wachaa.

136
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,750
--So strong!
--You became very powerful!

137
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,820
That was cool, Racoon-chan!

138
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,780
No, I'm not a racoon!

139
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,660
But you look like one now.

140
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,270
I guess you're right!

141
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,190
Let's go, kids!

142
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,370
It's freezing! Chopper,
can I borrow your fur?

143
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,060
Oh, sure.

144
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,120
I mean, no way!

145
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,980
What is this place?

146
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,800
Is it outside? Or is it a freezer?!

147
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,140
It's too dark. I can barely see anything.

148
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,130
It's perfect for me!

149
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,500
Yeah, but you're from a Winter Island.

150
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,310
Isn't this a path? It's
too dark and I can't...

151
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,050
Oh, I see it! There's a door!

152
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,100
Oh yeah!

153
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,610
Let's go! It's not a dead end!

154
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,720
Okay!

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,810
Sis! I don't like this place! I'm scared!

156
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,610
What?

157
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,110
--What's wrong, kids?
--Let's go! They're coming!

158
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,910
When I first got here, I
walked through this place!

159
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,060
Are you sure?!

160
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,420
That means it'll lead us to the exit!

161
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,130
It's really cold but hang on! Let's go!

162
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,610
No!

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,710
I mean...

164
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,270
When you look around...

165
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,670
Around?

166
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,080
There is something in the wall...

167
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,580
This path scares me because there
are frozen people all around!

168
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,460
Huh?! What's going on here?!

169
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,420
Dead bodies in ice?!

170
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,500
There are more up there!

171
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,530
Down there, too!

172
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,470
N-N...

173
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,810
No!!

174
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,430
No, Sis, wait! Don't leave us!

175
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,260
Okay, I think I'm done.

176
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,520
INSIDE OF THE LABORATORY -
BISCUIT ROOM SANJI'S GROUP

177
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,080
Hey, you blocked their path already.

178
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,110
That should be enough!

179
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,130
Let's go! I just felt
Nami-san's inner scream!

180
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,160
Maybe she wants to tell me that she loves me!

181
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,830
By the way, what are those people?

182
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,430
They're half sheep.

183
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,290
I think there was a mythical
creature like this.

184
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,470
Don't bother to think about them now.

185
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,560
We have to get the whole picture first.

186
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,090
Let's go save Nami-san now!

187
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,680
Wait! Leave me here! I want to stay here!

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,050
My boy was not among those children.

189
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,270
There must be other rooms so I'll stay and...

190
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,050
You can't even move on your own!

191
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,340
If we leave you here, we would
feel like we're abandoning you!

192
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,120
And that's not a great feeling!

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,440
But I'm here to rescue my boy!

194
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,240
Don't irritate me!

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,550
Why don't you just ask me to find your body?!

196
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,370
Where is it?!

197
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,960
I don't wanna owe anything to pirates!

198
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,770
I wouldn't ask you even if it kills me!

199
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,180
H-However, if you want to look for my body...

200
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,140
I won't stop you.

201
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,240
You're just a severed-head!
Don't be so arrogant!

202
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,690
Are you gonna use violence against me?!

203
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,560
I have no regrets!

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,150
I'm not gonna beg a thug for my life!

205
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,520
Hey, stop.

206
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,320
You're not gonna feel better by
smashing a helpless severed-head.

207
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,170
When you took him out of the room,
you already gave in to him, Sanji!

208
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,990
But...!

209
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,760
He's pissing me off!

210
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,960
I was so stupid to be moved
by his determination!

211
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,420
I don't wanna help him!

212
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,620
Now, I'm not even capable of
fighting back if someone hits me

213
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,050
so you can carry me if you want to.

214
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,930
Damn! We'll settle this once
you get your body back!

215
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,450
You show no mercy even on
a severed-head like me.

216
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,690
I better watch my mouth.

217
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,940
I wonder if Nami found the way out!

218
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Let's find them!

219
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm really... itchy!

220
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,370
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND - THE
MIDDLE LAKE LUFFY'S GROUP

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,950
I got you, intruders!

222
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,870
No, he sliced it.

223
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,750
Take a good look.

224
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,880
They're so dull.

225
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,430
Good job, Zoro-kun! I have to compliment you!

226
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,560
Hey, I got Leg-maro too!

227
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,480
--He cut the shell in half?!
--Damn samurai!

228
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,860
Don't hesitate! Fire!

229
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,290
We can't clear the air!

230
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,030
They look like they're dumb, so...

231
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,030
We should be friends!

232
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,830
Gum-Gum Leg-maro Balloon!

233
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,080
He's doing something again-bu!

234
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,330
Leg-maro has nothing to do with it!

235
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,460
What?! He repelled them all!

236
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,130
What's wrong with his body?!

237
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,420
He's a Devil Fruit eater.

238
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,350
Then I know what to do!

239
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,600
Prepare to fire!

240
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,350
They're gonna shoot again.

241
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,740
They'll never learn. I'll
be counting on you guys!

242
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,820
Wait.

243
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,030
They're aiming at the water!

244
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,360
They're gonna try to sink the boat!

245
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
What?! We have two Devil
Fruit eaters on board!

246
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,750
Take good aim!

247
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,080
We'll let them fall into the water!

248
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
Rot in hell, Devil Fruit eaters!

249
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,550
Damn!

250
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,220
Fire!

251
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,350
Here they come!

252
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,750
Let's get behind an iceberg!

253
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,090
All right!

254
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,080
That was close.

255
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,100
Why aren't you rowing?

256
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Devil Fruit eaters can't fight in the water!

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,910
Sink to your death, Devil Fruit eaters!

258
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,120
A SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAIN
NEAR THE LABORATORY BROOK

259
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,790
Gross! So gross!

260
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,320
What's wrong with that ghost?!

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,800
Suddenly attacking me!

262
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,760
Why do I have to get attacked?!

263
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,230
He's kind of strong too!

264
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,210
I hear something in the distance.

265
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,410
I don't have ears though.

266
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,320
You are so persistent!

267
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,610
I have no choice! I'll fight you!

268
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,890
I'll forget I saw it.

269
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,180
Oh, I don't have eyes anyway.

270
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,850
THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE LABORATORY

271
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,490
Hello? My name is Monkey D. Luffy! I'm
gonna become the King of the Pirates!

272
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,230
You picked up too fast and said too much!

273
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,750
Help me!

274
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,110
What happened?

275
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,120
It's cold... Is this the Boss?!

276
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,110
No, I'm not the Boss.

277
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,200
My colleagues are getting
cut one after another!

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,040
The samurai are gonna kill us!

279
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,560
Where are you?!

280
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,500
Somebody please help me! I'm on...

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,670
...Punk Hazard!

282
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,720
The name of the island and
the fact he said "It's cold."

283
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,230
There is almost no doubt that this
man sent the signal from this island.

284
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
You know Straw Hat Luffy, don't you?

285
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,440
Gum-Gum...

286
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,280
...Balloon!

287
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,020
Repel!

288
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,910
Room.

289
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,700
Shambles.

290
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
I've been killed!

291
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
When the incident involving the Roswalds,

292
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,820
a Celestial Dragon family,
happened on Sabaody 2 years ago,

293
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,300
Kid, Straw Hat and you fought together.

294
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,430
And during the War of the Best...

295
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,800
Put Straw Hat-ya on my ship!

296
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,030
I'm gonna help him get out of here.

297
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,220
Let me take care of him for now!

298
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,810
When Akainu was after Straw Hat,  you...

299
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,980
...helped him get away!

300
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,570
What do you want?

301
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,770
I know you Navy people are good at
forging those emergency signals.

302
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm afraid it wasn't a trap that we set.

303
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,530
Oh yeah?

304
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,800
But I don't know anything so there's
nothing more to talk about.

305
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,160
Cut that crap.

306
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,340
Let us see inside the laboratory.

307
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,660
It's my vacation home now. I refuse!

308
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,070
What's wrong with me - a pirate staying
on an island you people abandoned?

309
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,570
I'm the only one here!

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,810
If Straw Hat comes, I'll
chop his head off for you.

311
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,400
If that's all you have to say, go home!

312
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,650
So scary! Those frozen people!

313
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,050
I've had it with this place!

314
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,550
But look! There's a door! We can get out!

315
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah!

316
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,390
There is somebody else in there!

317
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,410
I made it out!

318
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,770
Outside?! It's freezing!

319
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,440
We made it!

320
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,670
I got out of the building! I can go home!

321
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,590
I can see my dad and mom again!

322
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,200
It's cold!

323
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,620
Get out of my way, kids!

324
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,290
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Franky!

325
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,660
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Tank!

326
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,510
Clear the way, clear the way, Super the way!

327
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,530
I'll run over you if you stand in my way!

328
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,850
But I avoid running over flowers!

329
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm kind of sweet - Franky Tank!

330
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,980
All right! Here we go, everybody!

331
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,560
Yeah!

332
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,190
One, two, three...

333
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,990
Super!

334
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,870
The Straw Hats?! Children?!

335
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,500
I don't know where to begin!

336
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,340
A big racoon, a woman in bikini
in the winter, giant kids,

337
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,520
a robot, and a severed-head...

338
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,750
Am I dreaming?!

339
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,030
--Tank treads!
--Cool!

340
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,970
--Awesome!
--A tank!

341
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,540
The best!

342
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,930
Bad roads won't trouble me!

343
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,320
Nami-san! I'm glad that you're okay!

344
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,140
I like the way you shiver
in the cold but I don't want

345
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
you to get sick so take my jacket!

346
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,820
Thank you, Sanji-kun!

347
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,120
You look familiar!

348
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,730
Yeah, he was there at Sabaody!

349
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,330
Are you the one who locked
up these children?!

350
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,580
You brute! You can't take them back!

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,040
Oh, you're...!

352
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,880
I was wondering who this
villainous guy was! Smoker!

353
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,670
And you, cutie!

354
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,290
This is not good! The Navy's here!

355
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,980
We can't escape from here!
Let's look for another exit!

356
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,430
Get inside!

357
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,940
Hurry up, kids! Go to the back!

358
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,980
There should be a backdoor!

359
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,230
What brought the Navy to such a place?!

360
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,980
I don't know! Just run!

361
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,060
Oh? I thought the Navy were good people.

362
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,330
Why don't you go to them, then?

363
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,410
No, they look like gangsters!

364
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,950
You lied! You weren't the only one here!

365
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,040
Seems like I wasn't. I'm also surprised.

366
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,920
Everybody, let's catch the Straw Hats!

367
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,970
All right, let's go! Follow Captain-chan!

368
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,130
No, wait!

369
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,390
Room.

370
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,440
--Ouch!
--Are you alright?

371
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,610
Those fools... They brought trouble!

372
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,610
Takt!

373
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,070
What's making that noise?

374
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,640
No way!

375
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,150
The warship is in the air!

376
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,500
Along with the bottom of the river!

377
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,170
What's going on here?!

378
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,420
I can't let you leave the island now.

379
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,050
I'm sorry that I said no one's here.

380
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,510
I knew he was dangerous!

381
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,350
Step back.

382
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,900
You guys are no match!

383
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,040
He'll chop off your hands and feet!

384
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,980
Go, Smo-yan!

385
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,620
--Kick his ass!
--Show him the true power of G-5!

386
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,090
Law's power, capable of lifting even warships...

387
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,250
...overwhelms the Navy's G-5.

388
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,330
Sanji and Nami's group also ends up...

389
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,390
...in an unprecedented situation because of Law.

390
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,590
Meanwhile, Luffy's group comes
upon a lake in the frozen lands...

391
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,100
...and encounters a crisis of its own!

392
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

393
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,710
"In a Real Pinch! Luffy Sinks
into the Ice-cold Lake!"

394
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,630
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
