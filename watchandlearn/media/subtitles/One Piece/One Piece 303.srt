00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,930
"Boss Luffy Is the Culprit?
Track Down the Missing Great Cherry Tree"

26
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,750
Spring has come here in Grand Jipang, too.

27
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,140
They say one sleeps right
through the dawn in spring.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,650
So you'd think the townspeople
must be taking it easy,

29
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,080
but it's not really the case.

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,610
It's finally tomorrow! With this weather,
it'll be the perfect time to view them.

31
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,250
Yeah, it puts me in a good mood.

32
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,760
On my way here, I ordered catered
box lunches from Pinwheel for my family.

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,300
What a treat!

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,260
And this is what the townspeople
are all worked up about.

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,990
Under this millennium cherry tree,
which is the pride of Grand Jipang,

36
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,990
they hold a huge party once a year
that everyone in town attends.

37
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,270
That's enough to get anyone excited.

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,710
Sounds like I can expect lots of offerings.

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,450
Even a hungry monk can get antsy.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,910
Shut your trap.

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,910
A-Anyway, even at a time like this,

42
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,540
there are also those who have
more pressing matters to deal with.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,500
Influenza? What the heck is that?

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,040
It's also called the flu...
It's a kind of infectious disease.

45
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,840
It's contagious, so don't go outside,
just stay in bed, okay?

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,260
What?!

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,220
Oh, no! We promised to go to the cherry
blossom viewing together tomorrow.

48
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,330
That's out of the question!

49
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,700
If he does that, he'll get worse,
and he could even die.

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,170
Oh, no... Carrot's been
looking forward to it, too.

51
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,480
Doc! Please do something!
You're a doctor, right?!

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,970
Don't be unreasonable.

53
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,440
Even a doctor can only do so much.

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm sorry, guys.

55
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,700
It's my fault that I got sick.
Don't blame Dr. Bluenose.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,460
Don't worry about me.

57
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,930
You guys go to the cherry
blossom viewing tomorrow.

58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,840
Geez...

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,060
"We are accepting box lunch
orders for cherry blossom viewing"

60
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,570
Everyone's talking about the cherry
blossom viewing. How annoying!

61
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,410
Oh, don't say that.

62
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,490
Thanks to the cherry blossom viewing,
we have a flood of box lunch orders.

63
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,280
The millennium cherry tree is a blessing for us.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,440
That's right.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,420
Ha! Put yourself in my shoes.

66
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,530
While everyone else's out partying,
we have to patrol the town.

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,970
What're you saying?
The entire town becomes empty.

68
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,840
You policemen have to work hard
at a time like this. Right, Boss?

69
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,090
Isn't there something we can do...?

70
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,790
Yeah, I wonder...

71
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,420
I wish there was some way I could
show him the millennium cherry tree...

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,630
I wish there was some way
I could cure his disease...

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,570
What's up with those two?

74
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,100
Beats me. But they've been like this for a while.

75
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,690
No good. I can't come up
with a single good idea.

76
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,890
Me neither.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,430
Hey, you two! Are you leaving?

78
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,660
See you later, Dr. Bluenose.

79
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,890
Yeah.

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,200
Hey, that's not like him, and tomorrow is
the long-awaited cherry blossom viewing day.

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,540
To think that Boss didn't finish his food...

82
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,310
And... the day of the cherry blossom
viewing event has come at last.

83
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,900
Your medicine is ready, Carrot.

84
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,550
What the hell is this?!

85
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,390
The millennium cherry tree is...
gone without a trace!

86
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,610
This is indeed quite mysterious.

87
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,150
What reason could there be
for stealing such a huge thing?

88
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,280
Good point. If it was about stealing money,
I'd have an idea who did it...

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,620
...but my guess is that...

90
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,330
...our lord is the culprit!

91
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,530
Our lord?!

92
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,710
Yeah. In order to take the
townspeople's pleasure all for himself,

93
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,000
he must've moved the tree
to his estate during the night!

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,860
He wouldn't do such a thing!

95
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,410
Seriously, I should never have asked you.

96
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,000
Where's Straw Hat during
an emergency like this?!

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
W-Well, I went to get him, but he wasn't there,

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,110
so I just assumed he was already here.

99
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,270
I wish there was some way I could
show him the millennium cherry tree...

100
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,470
The millennium cherry tree...

101
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,540
Don't tell me...

102
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey! Is Boss here?!

103
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,130
Wh-What? What happened?

104
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,170
Well, since the cherry tree is gone,

105
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,050
we had a flood of box lunch order cancellations.

106
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,450
Thanks to the cherry tree thief,
we're taking a huge loss.

107
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,020
This might be the end of Pinwheel.

108
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,100
I'm sorry to hear that.

109
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,230
Hey...! Hey, got a minute?

110
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,700
--What is it?
--Well...

111
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,580
Boss is the cherry tree thief?!

112
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,530
Shhh! It's not like I know anything for sure yet,

113
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,780
but he was acting
strange yesterday, wasn't he?

114
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,830
Come to think of it, he wanted to
show the cherry tree to someone.

115
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,850
Yeah, exactly!

116
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,600
I haven't seen him this morning,
so my guess is...

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,540
Who'd you say was the cherry tree thief?

118
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,390
That damn Straw Hat!

119
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,670
W-Well, like I said, I don't know for sure yet!

120
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,640
You guys! You know what
you're supposed to do, right?!

121
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,130
It doesn't matter if it's the Boss or not--

122
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,860
just arrest the culprit and resume
the cherry blossom viewing event!

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Get going!

124
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,620
Y-Yes, ma'am!

125
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,960
Hey, did you find him?!

126
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,880
--No, no luck.
--What about Dr. Bluenose's place?

127
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I haven't checked Doc's place yet,

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,070
but someone saw the boss
going into Carrot's house earlier,

129
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,930
so I'm on my way there right now.

130
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,970
Carrot's house?!

131
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah. It seems that he was mumbling
about cherry blossoms as he walked.

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,880
What?

133
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,900
♪ Cherry blossoms! La la la...
Cherry blossoms! La la la... ♪

134
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,840
♪ The March sky... La la la... ♪

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,790
♪ As far as the eye can see is... La la la... ♪

136
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,910
--♪ Hazy like a mist... ♪
--Ahhh!

137
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,920
Hm?

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,430
Oh, hey! What're you two doing here?

139
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,950
Don't "What're you two doing here" us!

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,790
Hey, Straw Hat! Where'd you
get that cherry tree branch?!

141
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,630
Hm? Oh, this?

142
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,480
Don't play dumb! Where'd you hide
the actual millennium cherry tree?!

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,770
The actual millennium cherry tree?

144
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,790
You just don't know when to give up, Boss.

145
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,330
Surely you wouldn't say the millennium
cherry tree's disappearance

146
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,610
has nothing to do with that branch, would you?

147
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,190
What?! The millennium cherry tree is missing?!

148
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,810
Say, Boss, you can trust me,
so just tell me the truth!

149
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,050
Truth? All I did was pick this up at the door.

150
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,500
Are you trying to talk your way out of it?!
I've lost respect for you, Boss!

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,750
I left it there in the middle of the night!

152
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,460
See, I told you?! "I left it there..." Huh?

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
You said, "I"?

154
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,970
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,910
After we left here,

156
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,950
we were thinking we really wanted to
show the millennium cherry tree to Carrot.

157
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,920
So Pepper, Onion, and I went
to the millennium cherry tree.

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,880
Are you okay?!

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,630
We're all right! Don't worry!

160
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,970
Okay, let's get this one.

161
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,140
I'm sorry, but please let
us have this one branch.

162
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,110
Someone's coming!

163
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,570
What?!

164
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,030
Both of you! Come down quickly!

165
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,050
We don't have time to go down!

166
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,530
Take that branch and go on ahead!

167
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,400
No! Come down already!

168
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,270
Don't worry! Once they go past,
we'll come back right away!

169
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,820
Just leave it at the door
of Carrot's house, okay?

170
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,920
Don't get caught.

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,340
O-Okay.

172
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,230
Hurry!

173
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,900
I see... So you left that
cherry tree branch after that.

174
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,330
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,270
H-H-Hold on a sec!

176
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,940
Then, the culprit for
stealing the cherry tree is...

177
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,950
There's no way it's Pepper and Onion,
and obviously it's not me, either.

178
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,780
So those who came later
are the true culprits, huh?

179
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,450
This is bad, Boss!

180
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,570
Before we came here, I stopped
by Pepper and Onion's houses,

181
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,000
but they weren't there! Which means
they're gone along with the cherry tree!

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,790
What?!

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,290
Hm?

184
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,630
Ahhh!

185
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,930
Boss!

186
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,010
Don't worry! Just leave it to us!

187
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,490
Orika! Take care of the rest, okay?

188
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,520
O-Okay!

189
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,420
Oh, hey, Dr. Bluenose!
Please take care of Carrot!

190
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,530
What's going on?!

191
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,810
Oh, Doc! Good timing! Please check on Carrot!

192
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,530
O-Okay!

193
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,540
Hey, Boss! Couldn't the information
in that letter on the arrow be fake?

194
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,370
No, this isn't fake!

195
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,160
Anyway, let's hurry to the harbor!

196
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,580
Wh-Wh-What's gonna happen to us?!

197
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm scared!

198
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,130
What do you think, my foreign brother?!

199
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,300
I bet you've never seen such
amazing cherry blossoms before.

200
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,870
Isn't that right, "Silver Fox" Foxy,
collector of rare items

201
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,190
who travels the world and
always obtains what he desires?

202
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,300
Indeed, Buggy, my brother.

203
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,000
Its prettiness makes it a
perfect fit for my collection.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm sure Porche, who's waiting back in
our country, will be very pleased, too!

205
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,660
So this means our contract has
successfully concluded, huh?

206
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,920
With the money from this, I can start
my big advancement this time for sure!

207
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,950
Now, as promised, pay me
the 10 million Berries.

208
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,890
Oh, I don't have any money.

209
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,020
What?!

210
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,500
Y-Y-You don't have any money?!

211
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,470
Wh-Wh-What the hell are
you tryin' to pull here?!

212
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,810
Do you have any idea how hard we
worked to bring it here, you jerk?!

213
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,780
Are you saying you deceived me
when you were flat broke?!

214
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,500
No, no... I've got lots of money.
I'm loaded with money.

215
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,790
And if I sell this cherry tree to
another country, I'll get tons more money.

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,940
Thing is, I've got no money,
not even a single Berry, to give to you.

217
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,750
What'd you say?!

218
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,080
How dare you mock me so flashily?!

219
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,380
Guys! Prepare a Buggy Ball!

220
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
It's already ready!

221
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,670
You'll regret it.

222
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,460
Whoa!

223
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,830
Oh, she's...

224
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,050
Thanks! You sent me this letter, right?
Where's the cherry tree?

225
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,160
It's hiding behind that island.
The entire tree is on a big ship.

226
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,530
It's such a fine cherry tree.

227
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,830
They're probably planning to
sell it to some other country.

228
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,790
Fortunately, there's a river ferry
available. You should hurry there.

229
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,960
That's the island where the Government
is turning the surrounding sea

230
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,350
into reclamation ground so
that people can live there.

231
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,800
Right now, there's nobody there,
so it's true that it's inconspicuous, Boss.

232
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,870
At any rate, why don't we go there?

233
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,940
Thanks!

234
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,060
Huh?

235
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,020
Whoa! She's gone!

236
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,890
What a mysterious woman!

237
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,520
Well, whatever. Let's go!

238
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,180
What?! Hey, wait up, Boss!

239
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
Lady...

240
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,920
Y... o... u...

241
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,960
This is my power--the power
of the Slow-Slow Fruit!

242
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,930
This is a perfect technique to mark the
end of you idiots' lives, don't you think?

243
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,830
Don't worry. You'll be able
to move in 30 seconds.

244
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,170
Now, your precious cannon ball
will be wasted if you stay there.

245
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,850
Why don't you move to the center?

246
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,250
There, in the middle!

247
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,570
How... dare... you...?

248
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,160
Wh-What was that? What's going on?

249
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,040
Pepper and Onion had better be okay.

250
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,530
Pops, thanks! We can go on our own from here.

251
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,340
Oh, you will? I'm sorry I
couldn't take better care of you.

252
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,290
How does it feel to be
attacked by your own men?

253
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,690
You bastard!

254
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,900
You're not gonna get away
with this! Guys! Get him!

255
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,360
Yeah!

256
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,860
Morons!

257
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,030
Slow-Slow Beam!

258
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,120
Ah! Boss!

259
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,100
Boy, that was a surprise!

260
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,180
Hey, are you okay?

261
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,140
Boss!

262
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,390
Ah! Hamburg!

263
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,780
Hey, hey, who are you guys?!

264
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,110
Hm? Ah! Cherry tree!

265
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,010
Are you the cherry tree thief?!

266
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,110
What?! You sure run your mouth
for someone who broke my ship!

267
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,380
Who are you?!

268
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm Straw Hat Luffy! I'm a policeman!

269
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,070
Don't resist, Split-Head!

270
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,810
Split-Head?

271
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,540
What's with him? He got depressed big time.

272
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,900
More importantly, Boss...
there's someone we know over there.

273
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,420
Hm?

274
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,540
Ah! Buggy! You again?!

275
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,800
Give us the cherry tree back!

276
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,050
What the heck?

277
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,960
What're you doing?

278
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,300
Thanks to my Slow-Slow Beam,
his reaction is slow, too, you moron!

279
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,980
Be careful, Boss! He uses weird techniques!

280
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,230
Pepper! Onion!

281
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,880
Huh?! What's with him?
He just got blown away!

282
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,910
I'll make you experience the same thing.

283
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,200
My name is Foxy! I obtain whatever I desire.

284
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,380
Don't stand in my way, you lowly policeman!

285
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,760
Slow-Slow Beam!

286
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,640
Ah! Boss!

287
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,070
I don't care if you're a
policeman or a diseased man--

288
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,680
it's a thousand years
too soon to go against me!

289
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,970
In any case, looks like a bunch
of nuisances got on board.

290
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,440
I guess I'll get rid of them
all at once with a cannon.

291
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,610
I'm not gonna let him!

292
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,260
Boss...

293
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,120
How noisy...

294
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,160
Geez...! I can't even sleep in.

295
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,710
--Mr. Monk!
--Is it morning already?

296
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,910
Oh, yeah, today's the
cherry blossom viewing day.

297
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,980
Hey, where the hell am I?! What's going on?!

298
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,380
What're you doing there?

299
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,080
We got kidnapped along with the
cherry tree in the middle of the night.

300
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,740
This is no time for cherry blossom viewing.

301
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,970
What?! Then what about the
offerings?! What about food?!

302
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,050
Give us the cherry tree back!

303
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,560
Why would I?!

304
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,030
He stopped in the air!

305
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,600
Dammit!

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,280
Special Attack! Exploding Star!

307
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,320
Here you go!

308
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,900
Didn't work! Dammit!

309
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,120
Hey, are you the one...

310
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,240
...who ruined the cherry blossom viewing event?

311
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,250
Geez... There's no end to these guys...

312
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,340
Enough already!

313
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,600
That's exactly what I wanna say to you!

314
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,920
Gum-Gum...

315
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,090
Hm? It's been 30 seconds?

316
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm not gonna let him get away!

317
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,680
Double Slow-Slow Beam!

318
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,780
Chop-Chop Festi...

319
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,200
He repelled it with his sword!

320
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,750
Oh?

321
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,790
How dare you take away what
everyone was looking forward to?!

322
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,670
I'm definitely not gonna forgive you!

323
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm the one who won't forgive you!
How dare you do such a terrible thing to me?!

324
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,930
Don't yell so much. It'll come back soon.

325
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,300
What'll come back?!

326
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,360
My right hand.

327
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,970
Ahh!

328
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,860
...Billy Club!

329
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,950
Whoa! He sure went flying pretty far!

330
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,460
So, Boss, what do you wanna do with this one?

331
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,250
You're such an idiot.
What'd you come out for this time?

332
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,460
Come back when you get a clue!

333
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,460
Gum-Gum...

334
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,670
Billy Club Bodhisattva!

335
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Okay, then, shall we go back?

336
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,640
Yeah.

337
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,160
You're coming to view the cherry
blossoms too, right, Mr. Monk?

338
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,890
Yeah.

339
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,310
Good job, guys!

340
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,780
This is strange. Theoretically, it should work.

341
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,060
Carrot! Carrot!

342
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,330
Carrot!

343
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,560
Hey!

344
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,130
Ah...!

345
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,750
Ah!

346
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,440
Hey! We brought the millennium cherry tree!

347
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,080
Isn't this incredible?!
Take a look at this and cheer up!

348
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's play together soon!

349
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,180
You dummies!

350
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,740
You guys worried me!

351
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,010
Here you go! Thanks!

352
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,430
There! There! Heave ho!

353
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,990
Thank you! I'll get better soon!

354
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,060
Oh... he's fine.

355
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,730
I wonder if the medicine
finally started working...

356
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,570
No... This must also be
a form of medical science.

357
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,620
I thought I was able to meet a man
with some backbone. How disappointing.

358
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,690
Did you run out of strength
from your doping earlier?

359
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,700
If it's backbone you want,
I'll show you... another tactic!

360
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,950
On the next episode of One Piece!

361
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,610
"I Can't Protect Anyone Unless I Win!
Third Gear Activated!"

362
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,140
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
