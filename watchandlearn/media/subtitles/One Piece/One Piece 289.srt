00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,860
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,790
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,220
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,450
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,180
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,800
Third Gear!

35
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,810
They opened...

36
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,940
--Huh?!
--All right! I'm heading there now!

37
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,450
What?! How come you're small now?!

38
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,910
Oops!

39
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,920
All right! My body's back to normal!

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,540
Just wait, Robin!

41
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,710
I'll be sure to beat the crap
out of that pigeon guy!

42
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,940
Solid Beast Secret Technique...

43
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,210
...Owl Thrashing!

44
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,720
Chapapapapa!

45
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,230
Beans Left!

46
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,820
What was that?!

47
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,820
Ahh! This is terrible!

48
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,040
That's right! He's on our side right now!

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,290
I'll do what he told me to.

50
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,040
That's cola! Cola without doubt!

51
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,710
Thanks!

52
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,290
Super!

53
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,220
Chapapa... What's the deal?

54
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,050
It's not like drinking cola would
make a difference or anything.

55
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,580
Guard yourself.

56
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,760
Chapa? What a fool.

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,980
Are you gonna give me another pathetic punch?

58
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,310
Strong... Hammer!

59
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,620
Agh!

60
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,710
Whoooa! Amazing!

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,610
Sorry. My punches earlier
were indeed pathetic.

62
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,580
"Zoro Busts Out a New Technique!
The Sword's Name is Sogeking?"

63
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,970
Oh, that's right. Franky, I want
to tell you something while I can.

64
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,980
Hm?

65
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,440
Zoro and Sogeking got connected
by Sea Prism Stone handcuffs, and...

66
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,750
What?!

67
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,900
Then we can't do anything unless
we find that #2 key first?!

68
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,820
Yeah. That's right.

69
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,980
How stupid...

70
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Well, at least I know what's going on.

71
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,940
Chapa!

72
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm really angry now! Chapapa!

73
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,990
He sure is tough. He's up now.

74
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,870
Stay there and watch.

75
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,830
Franky...

76
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,360
...Destroyer Cannon!

77
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,490
Wow...

78
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,180
Ow, ow, ow...! I don't like this attack
because it dislocates my joints!

79
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,250
What?! You shouldn't do it, then!

80
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,210
Chapapa! What a moron.

81
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm a Six Powers master.
Cannonballs would never hit me!

82
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,020
No matter how much you run around,

83
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,570
you can't escape from my
Franky Destroyer Cannon...

84
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,760
...because it's got chasing cannonballs!

85
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,260
Chasing cannonballs?!

86
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,750
Could it be that the cannonballs
sense the enemy and follow them?!

87
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,460
I've never heard of such technology!

88
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,310
What the heck is he?

89
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,140
Huh?

90
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,450
Hold it!

91
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,690
So it's you who chases the enemy?!

92
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,150
You jerk! Hold it!

93
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,820
Chapapa... I'm being fooled! That bastard!

94
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,700
He disappeared again.

95
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,960
Where are you hiding?!

96
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,230
It's no use searching for me.

97
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,310
I'm an expert at Shave, one of the Six Powers.

98
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,480
In addition to my lightning speed,

99
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,850
I make no noise when moving about,
just like owls when they hunt.

100
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,520
I carry out a perfect assassination.

101
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,970
An owl, huh?

102
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,620
My target won't see me until
the very moment he gets killed.

103
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,290
Take this!

104
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,250
He was hiding here.

105
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,430
Looks like that attack caught
you completely off guard, huh?

106
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,760
How impertinent!

107
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,710
I've never experienced such humiliation!

108
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,010
I'm a CP9 member!

109
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,720
Shave!

110
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
Whoa!

111
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,310
Iron Ball!

112
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,750
Ah! Watch out!

113
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,030
Dammit! We're above the sea!

114
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,710
Franky!

115
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,340
This is terrible!

116
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,490
If he gets swept away...

117
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,720
...he'll be headed straight
to the basin of the waterfall!

118
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,880
Since he's in the sea, I can't go rescue him.

119
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,640
Franky! Hang in there!

120
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,950
Chapapa!

121
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,700
Even if I get thrown into the
waterfall, I can use Moon Walk.

122
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,120
This is bad! I can't stop falling!

123
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,200
What a strong current! I can't
keep holding my breath, either!

124
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,310
I have to go up, at any rate!

125
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,580
Chapapa! Sink deep!

126
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,530
Yoyoi!

127
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,340
That voice... Don't tell me
he broke the fridge door...

128
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,850
I... I... I... I...

129
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,310
I... I... I... I... I...

130
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,700
I had a feast!

131
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,780
He got a little fatter!

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,250
Just how much stuff in that fridge did you eat?!

133
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,420
I don't wanna drown in a place like this!

134
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,390
Ahhh! I'm almost at the basin of the falls!

135
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll die! I'll die! I'm falling! Ahhh!

136
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,230
Franky Butterfly!

137
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,530
Chapapa! I'm not gonna let you do that!

138
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,870
Moon Walk!

139
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,750
Solid Beast!

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,100
That son of a bitch!

141
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,700
Hiyaaa!

142
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,940
--Chapa!
--Weapons Left!

143
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,060
Paper Art!

144
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,340
Slime!

145
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,900
Chapapa.

146
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,740
Dammit! What the hell was that?!

147
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,990
Oh, so close!

148
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,840
This is really bad.

149
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,240
At any rate, I'd better get to the shore!

150
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,960
1.0 Cola Cannon! Coup de Boo!

151
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,130
Chapa.

152
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,040
Did you learn your lesson?

153
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,970
It takes more than just strength
to defeat a Six Powers master!

154
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,560
--Strong Hammer!
--Paper Art.

155
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,530
Fall into the falls!

156
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,570
Strong Right!

157
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,640
What...?

158
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,530
What?!

159
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,030
Now, come!

160
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,720
Chapa!

161
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,990
Let go of me, you bastard!

162
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,000
Moon Walk with just one leg
can't support two people!

163
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,820
We're gonna fall!

164
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,290
Yeah, seems like it.

165
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,950
So why don't you bring both of us
back to the shore before we fall?

166
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,980
Or do you wanna try fighting me
while supporting our weight?

167
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,460
It's clear how it'll turn out,

168
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,460
but in that case, my life will be in danger, too.

169
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,430
We're certainly in the same boat.
Let's go back to the shore.

170
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,540
Okay! That's right!

171
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,050
Good job, good job.

172
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,900
Let's go back to the shore together.

173
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,200
Chapapa! But I think the fight
will end the moment we get there.

174
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,500
Oh? You think so?

175
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,480
Chapapapapapa!

176
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,330
Yeah, because I just thought of a way
to finish you off with just one blow.

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,750
Oh? So did I, Fukurou-kun.

178
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,380
Chapa...

179
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,690
Robin! Robin! Can you hear me?!

180
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,360
We're gonna rescue you for sure!

181
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,750
We're gonna rescue you for sure. We promised.

182
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,320
We'll take you back no matter what!

183
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,790
Robin!

184
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,020
Isn't the #2 key here yet?

185
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,100
Zoro-kun! This is it for me! I'm exhausted.

186
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,220
Carry me on your back.

187
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,380
Why would I?!

188
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,970
Tempest Kick.

189
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,820
Finger Pistol!

190
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,230
What're you doing?!

191
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,560
You just aimed at me while pretending
to attack those two, didn't you?!

192
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,330
That's a false accusation,
but if you want, we can fight.

193
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,820
I've been frustrated for a while now
that you've been in my way.

194
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,790
What'd you say?! That's what I
wanna say, you stupid herbivore!

195
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,290
No, I'd have to say I prefer meat.

196
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,420
Giraffes should just eat tree leaves!

197
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,210
Looks like we can't avoid fighting, huh?

198
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,640
Okay, then, you just wait here.
I'll go kill our prey.

199
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,290
Don't worry. It won't take long.

200
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,100
Wait! I don't object to us fighting,
but I won't let you have my prey!

201
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,030
Wow, I'm so curious!

202
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:49,190
Zoro-kun, which do you think is stronger,
Mr. Giraffe or Mr. Wolf?

203
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,490
Hm?

204
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,730
Don't you wanna see?

205
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,030
--Not really.
--I see! So you wanna see their fight, too, huh?!

206
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,120
No, like I said...

207
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,990
Leave things to me here.

208
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,590
Zoro-kun used to be a
well-known pirate hunter,

209
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,180
and is now the swordsman of the Luffy Pirates.
According to his prediction...

210
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,950
Oh, I see! He says the wolf is stronger after all!

211
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,930
That's just natural.

212
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,620
What is it? I see. Still, it's hard
to ignore Mr. Giraffe, he says.

213
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,900
I see, I see. That Sky Slicer, was it?
That was incredible, wasn't it?

214
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,070
They know their stuff.

215
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,650
Wolves are just sly, that's all.
The fact is, they aren't that capable at all.

216
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,140
You son of a bitch! I can't take it anymore!

217
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,040
Do you wanna fight right here right now?

218
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,350
Good, good. All right,
now is our chance, Zoro-kun.

219
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,370
Oh, I see!

220
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,930
It'd be good for us if we can get
them to fight and kill each other.

221
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,880
At the least, we'll get a chance
to run while they're fighting, huh?

222
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,450
Hey! You're just noticing it now?!

223
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,800
And don't say it so clearly!

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,580
We almost got tricked into it.

225
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,720
Our prey come first, after all.

226
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,250
Zoro-kun! What do I do with you?

227
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,270
You completely ruined my plan!

228
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,730
It wasn't that great of a
plan from the start, was it?

229
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,460
Ah! Here is survival plan #2!

230
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,700
Zoro-kun. Please make sure you
keep your mouth shut this time.

231
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,660
I wonder which one is cool, a giraffe or a wolf?!

232
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,020
Hm?

233
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,900
Being strong isn't enough!

234
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,630
True strength means one is beautiful and cool!

235
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Hmm, I wonder which one.

236
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,640
Hmm, he indeed has a point.

237
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,020
There's nothing to discuss. It's obvious
that wolves are stronger and cooler.

238
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,870
What're you saying?!

239
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,220
Giraffes are definitely more popular
among kids in a zoo than wolves!

240
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,780
So giraffes are cooler!

241
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,700
As expected, it seems we
fight like cats and dogs.

242
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,700
I'm a giraffe, okay? Not a cat.

243
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,580
Now is our chance, Zoro-kun!

244
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,630
A trick like that won't last for long.

245
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,760
Th-Then are you saying that
you've got a different plan?

246
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,590
We'll play rock-paper-scissors, Sogeking.

247
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,600
--What?
--The problem is these handcuffs.

248
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
There's a way to get them off of us.

249
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,600
What?! Does it have anything to do
with playing rock-paper-scissors?

250
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,060
I'll cut off the hand of the loser.

251
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,770
Wh-What's with you coming up with
such a scary idea with a serious look?!

252
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm not done! Listen further!

253
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,160
So the one who got the handcuffs off like that

254
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,770
will hurry to Chopper with the cut-off hand

255
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,430
and have Chopper put it back
by re-connecting it to his wrist!

256
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,000
We're not stuffed animals! Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,910
I've got another idea.

258
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,970
Ahh! Ahh! I don't wanna hear it!

259
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,770
I'm tired of arguing.

260
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,980
I can start anytime. The winner can
keep the prey all to himself, so...

261
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,110
--Hm?
--That's...

262
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,090
Snap!

263
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,870
Listen, Sogeking. Don't lose your posture.

264
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,830
You are a sword!

265
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,100
Someone get me a lawyer! I'll sue you for sure!

266
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,110
Now, what're you gonna do?

267
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,190
Take me to the shore already
so that I can knock you out!

268
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,950
You don't have to tell me!
I'll shut you up right here, right now!

269
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,590
Super Cartwheel, Iron Ball!

270
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,620
I'll slam you into the corner of
the tower using this momentum!

271
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,090
I see. It indeed looks like
I'll get smashed into pieces.

272
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,550
Franky Centaur!

273
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,080
--Chapa!
--I've got both your legs!

274
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,310
Now you can't move around at will in the air!

275
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,850
So what?! Even if you do that,
you can't stop this momentum!

276
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,060
That's not totally true.

277
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,500
70 mm 0.2 Cola Cannon!
A bit of Coup de Vent!

278
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,240
Ahh! The momentum has died down!

279
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,190
The rotation stopped! Damn you!

280
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,830
But this is enough!
We're already above the shore!

281
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,850
Now, take this!

282
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,800
70 mm 1.5 Max Cola Power!

283
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,220
Coup de...

284
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,710
What're you doing?!

285
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,100
Give up already, you bastard!

286
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,140
Coup de...

287
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,900
...Vent!

288
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,010
Super!

289
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Doctorine...

290
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,340
I promised you that I wouldn't
use the third rumble ball...

291
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,550
...but I want to save Robin.

292
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,460
I want to put my life on the
line to save our friend, too.

293
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,730
Doctorine... I'm sorry.

294
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Rumble!

295
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
On the next episode of One Piece!

296
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,670
"Uncontrollable! Chopper's Forbidden Rumble"

297
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
