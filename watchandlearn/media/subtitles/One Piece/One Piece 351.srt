2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,020
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,750
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,210
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,380
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,400
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,950
This shadow will bring me one step closer

48
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,850
to becoming the King of the Pirates, Hogback!

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,690
It's been a decade since we first met.

50
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,820
I put all of my prowess into creating
No. 900 for a day such as this!

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
With that shadow in it,

52
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,940
I'm certain it'll become the
most powerful zombie in history!

53
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,740
It will be a great asset!

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,540
The day I become the world's
"King of the Grave" is close at hand!

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,530
I can practically see the day I turn
the cute critters of the world

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,220
into zombies and make them
serve me in my dream kingdom.

57
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,590
Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho!
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

58
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,950
--Luffy!
--Stupid! Don't pop out!

59
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,580
He won't die just because they took his shadow!

60
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,210
Remember Brook!

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,390
Uh-huh...

62
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,970
Here, guys, take this.

63
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,880
What is it?

64
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,490
The zombies' weakness!

65
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,360
This is their weakness? What exactly is it?

66
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,620
It's salt.

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,580
To reiterate, please stuff salt into
a zombie's mouth to defeat it!

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,180
That's the trick! Even for this
bag of bones, that's a snap!

69
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,830
--Snap! Snap! Snap!
--But Brook...

70
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Why are you so knowledgeable
about the zombies and this island?

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,300
That has to do with when I lost
my shadow five years ago...

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,270
Naturally, they sent me back out to drift at sea.

73
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,770
Fortunately, I was able to
turn back by the time I awoke.

74
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,320
And thus I returned to the island and fought.

75
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,320
But in the end, I lost miserably.

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,730
Well, you'll have to pardon me.

77
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,850
I'm in a hurry. Take care!

78
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,120
Stop right there!

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,450
On top of everything you've told us,
answer this one question before you go.

80
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,680
I can't wait!

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,890
When I saw his corpse in the Land of Ice,
my body wouldn't stop trembling.

82
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,440
I had never dreamed I'd get to see
that legend with my own two eyes!

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
This is a zombie creator's--

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,900
Hey, Cindry-chan! Why are
you walking in front of me?

85
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,680
Yet another legend shall come back to life!

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,990
Long time no see, No. 900.

87
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,930
Now, it's time for him to awaken!

88
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:08,330
He is the only berserker to have
gone down in history as a "Devil."

89
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,470
Oars!

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,980
"Awakening After 500 Years!!
Oars Opens His Eyes!!"

91
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,710
Let's get this underway!

92
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,340
What is that? A-A giant's... corpse?

93
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,350
Even for a giant, it's freaking huge!

94
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,060
Don't make a sound, Chopper!

95
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,110
Be still, Straw Hat Luffy's shadow!

96
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,120
I am your new master.

97
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,490
I'm about to provide you with a voice and body

98
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,800
so that you may live as a zombie.

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Forget all of your past relations
and become my obedient soldier!

100
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,390
We have a deal!

101
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,020
Wha...?

102
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,940
We should have made Cindry-chan
agree to forget her past, too.

103
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,960
Then I'd actually get to eat on plates.

104
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,990
I wish I could break your knee caps like plates.

105
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,740
Yikes! Cindry-chan, that threat was super scary!

106
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,110
Cindry doesn't show Hogback
any mercy, does she?

107
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,780
That was a Hog-smackdown...

108
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,630
Huh?

109
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,720
It's time! Awaken!

110
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,010
L-Luffy's shadow...!

111
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,850
Arise from 500 years of slumber!

112
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,870
Wh-What's happening?

113
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,030
Luffy's shadow...!

114
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,350
It went in!

115
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,640
No! Don't scream!

116
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,650
The corpse moved!

117
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,610
Who are they?

118
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,010
C-C-Crap! They found us!

119
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,370
I screamed out!

120
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,660
A demon has awoken!

121
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,290
Hey, Kumacy! Don't tell me
you've been sheltering the pirates!

122
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,010
My bride! What are you doing down here?

123
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,000
We won't let you escape!

124
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,040
Magnificent!

125
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,100
How truly overawing!
He's a piece of art! A real devil!

126
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,990
Meat!

127
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,880
Wh-What was that?

128
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,430
I'm hungry!

129
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,030
Kumacy, don't let go of me!

130
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,760
--Okay!
--What?!

131
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,870
--Now zoom!
--Yep!
--Uh-huh!

132
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,760
Hey! Where are the pirates?
Where did my bride go?

133
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,260
They ran as fast as their legs could carry them!

134
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,300
Boy, can they run!

135
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,220
Tch! I won't let them escape!

136
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,360
Sanji, feed me!

137
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,310
Huh? Sanji? Who's that?

138
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,210
What was that? What did we just witness?

139
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,010
The corpse started to move
after he inserted Luffy's shadow!

140
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,220
That's the deal behind these zombies.

141
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,060
This is how Dr. Hogback
brings people back to life...

142
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,140
That huge creep's ability probably stems from...

143
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,150
...a Devil Fruit!

144
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,150
Considering the first word out
of his mouth was "meat"...

145
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,200
...that monstrous giant clearly
has Luffy's personality, huh?

146
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,110
--Yeah...
--Then think back!

147
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,700
We ran into a penguin in the
breezeway who resembled Sanji-kun.

148
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
I won't kick a woman...

149
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,830
...even if it kills me!

150
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,450
Oh, yeah! So does that mean
he had Sanji's shadow?

151
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm sure it does!

152
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,590
There was the samurai who hit
us with the back of his sword!

153
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,430
May I see your panties?

154
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,180
No way!

155
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,060
That was Brook's shadow! And we had no idea!

156
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,900
All of the strange things on this
island are starting to make sense!

157
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,990
He was just pretending to make zombies!

158
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,990
That man is making a mockery of human life!

159
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,650
How is this fulfilling "mankind's dream"?!

160
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,330
How is this "resurrecting the dead"?!

161
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,590
Dr. Hogback is a truly
wonderful man! I respect him!

162
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,090
He isn't the least bit
interested in saving people!

163
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,550
He's just a scumbag!

164
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,400
Chopper...

165
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,060
You don't have time to lament over that now!

166
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,440
Our pals fell victim to his
game of make-believe zombies!

167
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,110
Don't you see? We're the
only ones who can save them!

168
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,530
Let's hurry! They carried
Luffy's body down this way!

169
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,210
Right! The perv said to take him to the ship.

170
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,530
I wonder if he meant Sunny.

171
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,120
If Zoro and Sanji met the same fate,
we might find them there!

172
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,100
I swear, those guys...

173
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,580
...can be such a handful!

174
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,900
Usopp! Chopper!

175
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,790
Are you okay?

176
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,130
Wh-What?! Ow!

177
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,710
Hey, let go of me!

178
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,560
This freak... is really strong!

179
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,900
Care to say your last farewells?

180
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,740
This woman is going to marry me today!

181
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,490
Moron! If I can't protect a single woman...

182
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,460
...there was no point in being born a man!

183
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Wow! Usopp, that weapon--!

184
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,920
Wh-Why does Usopp have it...?

185
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,510
Eat this!

186
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,520
Six Chamber Viper Star!

187
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,690
He's vanishing again!

188
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,320
Huh? I'm disappearing too?

189
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,280
Why?!

190
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,280
Nami vanished with him!

191
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,040
Nami!

192
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,750
Where are you?

193
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,460
What's that?

194
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,420
Some strong odor is masking his scent!

195
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,380
Save me, Usopp! Cho--

196
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,240
Hey, Nami! What happened?

197
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,220
Where are you?

198
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,020
Answer me, Nami!

199
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,900
Zombies, I'll let you take over from here!

200
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,420
Catch those two and bring
them before Moria-sama!

201
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,660
Shoot! Which direction
is his voice coming from?

202
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,360
Nami, where are you?

203
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,000
Usopp, behind you!

204
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,880
What's that?! A zombie in armor?!

205
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,330
A bunch of zombies are downstairs, too!

206
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,640
Wh-What now?

207
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,980
Hey, this looks bad!

208
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,270
We've got a bunch of zombies upstairs!

209
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,940
Hey, pirates! Hand over your shadows!

210
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,080
Ch-Chopper, don't get caught!
They'll take our shadows.

211
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,410
R-Right!

212
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,670
Shadows...!

213
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,330
Your shadows...!

214
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,000
Hand over your shadows!

215
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,590
There is even a zombie painting!

216
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,960
No!

217
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,600
Damn it! You guys play dirty!

218
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,480
You're immortal and get to
attack in numbers! It's no fair!

219
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,770
That's low! Aw, man!

220
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,310
All we want is your shadow, bro.

221
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,330
Crap! Let go! Shoot!

222
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,540
We can't let them catch us!

223
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,590
Wait!

224
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,550
There's more?!

225
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,020
Fork over your shadows!

226
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,720
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

227
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,120
Give us your shadows!

228
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,210
Grah! W-We... We're doomed...!

229
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,670
Save me!

230
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,720
Hey, someone else is here!

231
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,730
Our buddies are getting purified!

232
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,170
You'd better get your mitts...

233
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,780
...off my sworn little brothers, punks!

234
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,150
C-Certainly!

235
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,100
Who the heck are those guys?
They're rottin' bad!

236
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,720
Big Bro!

237
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,270
Robin!

238
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,030
Did we take too long? We're short one.

239
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,160
Usopp, Chopper, are you two all right?

240
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,990
If you're my shadow,

241
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,760
why don't you understand
how important this afro is?

242
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,140
There is a reason why I can't afford to lose!

243
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,430
Not my afro! Anything but the 'fro!

244
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,010
On the next episode of One Piece!

245
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,600
"A Belief Worth Begging to Live For!!
Brook Defends His Afro!"

246
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
