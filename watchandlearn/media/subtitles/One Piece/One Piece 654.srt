morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,470

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,210

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,050
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,690
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,550
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,180
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,500
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,270
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

77
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,390
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

78
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,400
he decided to enter and fight
fierce battles against other tough

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,140
contenders from the New World.

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,350
Alright! Here we go!

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,080
The Gaon Cannon! Fire!

82
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,190
What is that?

83
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,430
Yes!

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,700
Head blow!

85
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:23,470
A long time ago...
It goes back 800 years, Law.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,950
20 kings from 20 countries came together
at the center of the world

87
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,080
and formed one giant organization.

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,060
That's what we call
the World Government now.

89
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,670
The kings who created it...

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,890
...decided to move to the Holyland of

91
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,060
Marie Jois and live there
with their families.

92
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,760
The Nefeltari Family of Alabasta refused,

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,400
so there were 19 families to be exact.

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,240
The descendents of those
creators who still live there

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,310
and reign over the world are the Celestial Dragons.

96
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,710
In those countries, they elected
new kings out of necessity

97
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,510
and new royal families rose.

98
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,070
In the case of my country - Dressrosa,

99
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,080
the new royalty was the Riku Family.

100
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,190
And the old royalty who
moved to the Holyland

101
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,170
of Marie Jois
as the creators of the world were...

102
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,140
...the Don Quixote Family!

103
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,800
"Beautiful Sword!
Cavendish of the White Horse!"

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,810
OFF THE COAST OF DRESSROSA

105
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,770
Now, what should we do with this?

106
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,450
Bone-kichi, I gave her a single blow, too!

107
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,780
I know. You have a great suji (aptitude).

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,810
Y-Yeah? Do I?

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,820
I don't have any suji (muscle), though.

110
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,320
Because I'm a skeleton.

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,330
It'd be too cruel to dump her into the sea.

112
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,900
Yeah, she's a Devil Fruit eater.

113
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,160
I don't even wanna see her panties.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,900
Wh-Who did you call Miss Universe?

115
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,690
Nobody said such a thing! No!

116
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,200
Should I hit her one more time?

117
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,140
Just leave her alone.

118
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,300
We gotta hurry and meet Tra-guy.

119
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,670
But why does he wanna leave Caesar with us?

120
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,240
Listen, I need you to...

121
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,450
....sail the ship to Green Bit now!

122
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,920
I wanna leave Caesar with you guys!

123
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,900
Yeah, it is strange.

124
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,920
Doflamingo resigned from the
Seven Warlords by our request

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,130
so we have to return Caesar to him.

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,650
Y-You idiots don't know anything, don't you?

127
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,190
Young Master-sama doesn't take negotiation

128
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,100
with brats like you seriously.

129
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,070
He didn't resign from the Seven Warlords.

130
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,510
What?

131
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,010
Hey, what do you mean by that?!

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,830
What do you mean?!

133
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,930
Ouch!

134
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,050
That hurt, you damn brat!

135
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,290
O-Nami!

136
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,380
You guys have been fooled!

137
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,090
Violet must've unearthed
all of your plans by now

138
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,970
and all of your friends
are probably captured!

139
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,520
What?!

140
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,870
All right! This stormy battle
royal is finally coming

141
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,220
to the final match - Block D!

142
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,060
All the competitors are
fighting for survival!

143
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,810
This battle is also going to
be bloody since there're so

144
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,670
many tough contenders.

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,590
First, I have to draw
your attention to this man!

146
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,370
He is a notorious class-A war criminal
from the Sea Battle of Dias!

147
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,140
SULEIMAN THE BEHEADER
A CLASS-A WAR CRIMINAL FROM THE SEA BATTLE OF DIAS

148
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,140
Suleiman the Beheader!

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,210
And...

150
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,870
An admiral of the Yonta Maria Grand Fleet!

151
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,840
"The Surmounter" Orlumbus!

152
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,830
"THE SURMOUNTER" ORLUMBUS - AN ADVENTURER/
AN ADMIRAL OF THE YONTA MARIA GRAND FLEET

153
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,050
A military captain of a southern country -
the Majiatsuka Kingdom!

154
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,050
Rolling Logan!

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,210
ROLLING LOGAN - A MILITARY CAPTAIN OF
A SOUTHERN COUNTRY - THE MAJIATSUKA KINGDOM

156
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,660
And there are more!

157
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,390
A FIGHTING LION - AGYO

158
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,000
A fighting lion - Agyo!

159
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

160
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,170
AN ARSONIST - DAMASK

161
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,250
An arsonist - Damask!

162
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,250
A sorcerer - Mummy!

163
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,460
A SORCERER - MUMMY

164
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,290
A GLADIATOR - AGILIA

165
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,840
A gladiator - Agilia!

166
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,030
Any one of them can win this battle!

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,090
The match has just begun but

168
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,080
the one that stands out the most so far is...

169
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,450
...the man that we were expecting!

170
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,800
Cavendish of the White Horse!

171
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,250
Who are you?

172
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,980
Gardoa, the beautiful bounty hunter!

173
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,080
Gardoa-sama! You're so handsome!

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
What's with that spear?

175
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,410
This is like a medal to me.

176
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,720
I use bounties I get from catching pirates

177
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,430
to get shinier and shinier spears.

178
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,600
There are so many people with a
high prize in this competition.

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,120
It's nice to make money.

180
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,460
If I can get hold of the prize on you -
280 million berries,

181
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,810
I can even make a diamond spear!

182
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,600
Smells good!

183
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,220
Damn!

184
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,970
How would you like this, then?!

185
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,620
Where is he?!

186
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm here!

187
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,140
A diamond spear?

188
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,140
You've got to be kidding!

189
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,240
What?!

190
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,260
People like you who try to best me,

191
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll never forgive them!

192
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,180
We were wrong!
Cavendish-sama, you're so cool!

193
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,190
He's really strong!

194
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes!

195
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,640
You hear that, Straw Hat Luffy?!
People cheer for me!

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm more popular than you!

197
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,530
Move, Cabbage!

198
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,470
I can't see Rebecca because of you!

199
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,250
--He's right!
--We don't wanna see you!

200
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,940
Just go away!

201
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,990
Rebecca!

202
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,420
I'm gonna take her down!

203
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,940
Just as we expected,

204
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,270
contenders who are looking to gain fame are

205
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,290
targeting the despised Rebecca!

206
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,130
It may be just a matter of time
before she gets defeated!

207
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,970
Rebecca, behind you!

208
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,870
Take this!

209
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,260
Kill her!

210
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,710
Chop her up and let her fall into the water!

211
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,440
GREEN BIT

212
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,630
So you're the Celestial Dragon.

213
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,310
Doflamingo!

214
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,050
I was, to be exact.

215
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,020
But not anymore.

216
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,700
What is "bloodline"? What is "destiny"?

217
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,350
I don't think there are that
many people who've led such

218
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,010
a checkered life as mine.

219
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,510
Explain it to me so I can understand!

220
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,470
I'm sorry, Law.

221
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,450
I wish I could tell the story of my life
before I met you, over drinks.

222
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,270
But I don't have time for that.

223
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,860
I've got to do something about
the Straw Hats in Dressrosa.

224
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,470
I know there are quite a few people
who underestimated them and got hurt.

225
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,570
What's the matter, Fujitora?

226
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,370
Well...

227
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,310
I heard a clap of thunder
from the direction of the sea.

228
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,460
How does the sky look?

229
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,920
Thunder?

230
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,390
I may be blind,

231
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,380
but I always thought I could tell the weather.

232
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,370
Maybe I'm getting too old.

233
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,920
I believe Nami-ya can manipulate the weather.

234
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,170
The ship is here!

235
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,330
Hey, Joker!

236
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,660
If you got it back, give it to me already!

237
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,600
My heart! My heart! Hey!

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,940
Give it to me now!

239
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,690
I never said that was Caesar's heart!

240
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,300
What?! You've been lording that
over me all along!

241
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,000
In fact, my heart is missing from my body!

242
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,820
Yeah, I can't hear my heartbeat!

243
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,080
Joker! What are you doing?!
You're killing me! I'm gonna die!

244
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,810
I didn't feel anything.

245
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,360
What?!

246
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,580
Hey, what's wrong?! Stay with me! Hey!

247
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,770
What?! Was it a Navy soldier's?!
Then, where's mine?!

248
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,030
I heard my man screaming!

249
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,110
What are you doing, Heavenly Demon?!

250
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,560
Room!

251
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,770
Keep pinning me down with gravity, Fujitora.

252
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,920
Or I'll run!

253
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,960
Shambles!

254
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,000
What? What?!

255
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,790
Joker! Help me!

256
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,910
You still have that much energy, Law?

257
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,450
He just doesn't know when to give up.

258
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,920
You bastard! Let go of me, Law!
Where's my heart?!

259
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,260
Don't give me trouble, you squirt!

260
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,740
You know there's no place to run!

261
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,450
You see Tra-guy?

262
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,820
I can't see clearly because of the fog.
I see a weird forest.

263
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,120
I don't wanna believe
what that old bat said but...

264
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,030
...what if, what if Tra-guy's
plan didn't work out well

265
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,780
and if we take Caesar with us,
what's gonna happen, then?

266
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,500
Doflamingo will come after us.

267
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,120
--What?!
--Huh?

268
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,910
I'm scared!

269
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,480
Ow, ow, ow...

270
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,830
What? What? What just happened?!

271
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,800
Wh-What's going on?

272
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,910
There is something in the water!

273
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,680
I-I-It's a school of the Fighting Fish!

274
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,140
You got too close to the island!

275
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,520
The Fighting Fish?

276
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,490
What are they?

277
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,500
They're killer fish that can sink a warship!

278
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,930
--What?!
--O-Nami!

279
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,610
Come after me, Doflamingo!

280
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,250
If he goes for the ship,
it's all over for us!

281
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,830
I'm gonna draw him to the bridge

282
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,770
and get Caesar on board the ship

283
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,100
and fight Doflamingo on the bridge

284
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,930
so I can buy enough time
for the ship to get away!

285
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,680
What?

286
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,740
Is he gonna go across the bridge?

287
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,220
I don't get it.

288
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,030
Why does he want to get to Dressrosa?

289
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,350
It's more favorable for me.

290
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,230
No! Idiots!

291
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,080
I get it.

292
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,120
Wait, Doflamingo!
They have nothing to do with this!

293
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,140
It's over, Law!

294
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,000
The ship is gonna break up!

295
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,790
Stop! Or I'm gonna grill you!

296
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,220
Where did those Fighting Fish go?

297
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,340
Bone-kichi, where did they go?

298
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,120
The Fighting Fish... The Fighting Fish...
The Fighting Fish...

299
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,900
What?!

300
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,350
What is it this time?!

301
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,720
--Doflamingo is flying towards us!
--What?!

302
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
Young Master-sama!

303
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,730
What is this?! A nightmare?!
Are we gonna get killed?!

304
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,780
No!

305
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,780
Watch this, Law!

306
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,640
I'll viciously slay your allies
right before your eyes!

307
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,290
Don't!

308
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,080
Tra-guy, help...

309
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,150
Hey!

310
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,990
My friends are crying in fear!

311
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,540
Leave them alone!

312
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,430
Sanji!

313
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,970
Here comes quite a tough one.
