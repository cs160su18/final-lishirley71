2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,980
Luffy, depressed after losing his brother
Ace in the war against the Navy,

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,360
realized the importance of friendship

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,700
and sent a message to his crew.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,430
"Living through Hell!
Sanji's Fight for His Manhood!"

63
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,880
On the small Sky Island - Weatheria...

64
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,660
--There she is!
--We found her finally!

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,700
--How could you fool us?
--You didn't just steal our research notes...

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,630
--But you toyed with...
--Our pure hearts!

67
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,800
Surrender yourself now!

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,960
You thieving girl!

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,270
Okay.

70
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,760
--The research notes!
--The Weather ball!

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,860
And the hostage - Mr. Haredas!

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,990
It's unforgivable even if you return them!

73
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,450
I'm sorry. I regret what I've done.

74
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,210
--No, we can't trust her!
--Let's strip her and banish her!

75
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,500
That's so... naughty...

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,630
Huh? Naughty?!

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,670
Naughty...

78
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,200
No, no, no, no! I didn't mean it
that way! What I wanted to say is...

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,810
She changed the subject...
She changed the subject!

80
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,830
Tut!

81
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,480
Did you just tut?

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,350
No! How terrible! That's an unjust charge!

83
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,130
Yeah, that's too much!

84
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,080
Huh, is it my fault?! Didn't
you guys hear that?!

85
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,950
--I don't think so...
--Don't get fooled by her!

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,490
It must be a mistake! I
wouldn't do such a thing!

87
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,910
M-Maybe I misheard...

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,080
She's manipulating them completely.

89
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,170
--She's wicked!
--Let's kick her out now!

90
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,660
No! I'm sorry! I regret what I've done!

91
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,000
How could we trust you?!

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,090
Yeah, I understand. Alright,
to show you how sorry I am,

93
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm gonna jump into the water.

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,310
Please forgive me in the afterworld!

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,350
Goodbye!

96
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,560
--We made her cry!
--Don't jump the gun!

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,150
You're too young to put an end to your life!

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
Bye!

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
We're sorry!

100
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,910
Okay, I forgive you!

101
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,900
Now, I'm gonna stay here a little
longer and study about weather!

102
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,330
Oh, my name is Nami. You
can call me Nami-san.

103
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,460
I need a house to live in.
Everybody needs a little privacy.

104
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,130
And a nice and comfortable bed, a
jet tub, and a big closet as well!

105
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,180
Thank you, grandpas in the sky!

106
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,470
Okay, let's do it! Yeah!

107
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,180
Mr. Haredas, come in! Over!

108
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,640
Good grief...

109
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,800
You were desperate to get
off of this island before.

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,960
What made you change your mind?

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,830
There's a lot going on.
Could you tell me now?

112
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,890
Hm, okay.

113
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:50,220
Weatheria travels on the wind and
wanders around the world in the sky.

114
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,760
Sometimes we descend to get
some supplies and information

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,520
and then continue on.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,680
Information?

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,350
Well, to check records.

118
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,640
There are still a lot of unknown
weather conditions and phenomena

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,230
that are difficult to fathom!

120
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,360
--What's this?!
--Are you listening?

121
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,970
Huh? You gotta be kidding!

122
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,620
Lightning strikes like rain?!

123
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,370
Yes, literally "like rain."

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,250
That's how it strikes that island.

125
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,320
That island is in the New World.

126
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,090
If you're willing to go to that sea,

127
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,630
you have to open your mind to the unexpected.

128
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,760
It's a big world!

129
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,020
I beg you. Teach me, Haredas-san,

130
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,600
everything that you know about...

131
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,040
...the weather of the New World!

132
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,690
You're desperate.

133
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,940
Of course, I am! All of my
friends' lives are in my hands!

134
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm a navigator!

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,990
I have to take
responsibility when we're on the ship!

136
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,910
I have to navigate the way
wherever my captain wants to go!

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,420
Luffy wants to become
the King of the Pirates.

138
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,300
I have to improve myself as a navigator!

139
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,320
Your captain must be happy to have
such a thoughtful crew member.

140
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,100
--I have no choice.
--You have no choice?

141
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,150
Yeah. He's so boastful, but he
doesn't know anything about the sea.

142
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,250
He always does ridiculous
things. If I left him alone...

143
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,460
Luffy...

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,380
Help me...

145
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,430
Of course I will!

146
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,900
If I left him alone, he'd
probably end up dead.

147
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,650
He's not-so-bright and high-maintenance!

148
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,660
Must be hard to have a captain like that.

149
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,160
Uh-huh. That's why I wanna help him.

150
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,460
Like he helped me.

151
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,380
Hey, tell me about the Weather ball.

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,010
It's not that simple. That's one of
the great inventions of Weatheria!

153
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,180
If you misuse it, it could
turn the world upside down!

154
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,240
It could be used as a weapon?

155
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,470
Hey, hey, that's too dangerous.

156
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,920
Don't smile like that!

157
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,780
Nami!

158
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,490
You’re my friend!

159
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,650
Meanwhile, on the Mechanical
Island Future Land Baldimore...

160
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,160
The unexpected bombing at
Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory!

161
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,700
We haven't found who did it!

162
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,670
Hey, hurry up!

163
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,000
It's not too much to say that it
was a greatest loss of our time!

164
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,570
Do you have any information?

165
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,550
I heard there was an intruder
that looks like a gorilla.

166
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,300
How mysterious!

167
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,140
In order to reach the harbor of this
island, you need a large ice-breaker.

168
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,890
But no one has seen one.

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,230
They say that the intruder was Cyborg
Franky of the Straw Hat Pirates

170
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,950
but he's just been seen on Sabaody
Archipelago within the past month and...

171
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,990
...we don't know how he
could've gotten to Baldimore.

172
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,830
Captain Gorilla! The search team
is leaving for the mountains!

173
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay! I'm coming with them!

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
Th-This is...!

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,250
The hidden entrance has been
uncovered by the explosion.

176
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,630
What a surprise. We didn't
know about this place.

177
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,510
I can't believe it.

178
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,930
There was another laboratory!

179
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,310
The working cyborg animals
must have been created here.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,790
Hey, don't break anything!

181
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,820
You can't talk to me like that!

182
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,900
In the laboratory that was blown away,

183
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,040
there
were some far-out inventions useful in daily life.

184
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,020
But what I wanted to know about
are the weapon inventions,

185
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,330
like the ones here.

186
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,710
This is great! Everything from
battleships to human cells...

187
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,590
How did he come up with
all these kinds of things?

188
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,390
Okay! I made up my mind!

189
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,310
I'm gonna live here!

190
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,770
Huh? Live here?!

191
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,750
Yeah!

192
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,480
I'll come down the mountain sometimes

193
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,440
to get more cola from your place.

194
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Okay?

195
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,440
Don't worry!

196
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,510
As long as you don't tell anybody,

197
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,070
I won't cause you trouble
because I'll live here.

198
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't panic every time you see my face!

199
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,790
--Don't look at us!
--That scary face is getting scarier!

200
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,510
How's this? A tiger rug!

201
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,130
--That's not bad...
--F-F-F-Franky!

202
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,800
--It's cold especially my legs.
--Why don't you wear your pants?

203
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,180
--Okay, now it's warm!
--Why don't you just wear your pants?

204
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,850
But you said you wanted to get off
of this island. What happened?

205
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,150
Well, not much but...

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,970
My dream...

207
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,120
I want you to sail on the ship...

208
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,290
...that I built!

209
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,430
Luffy...

210
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,800
You let me hold a dream.

211
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,960
Franky!

212
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,690
Thank you for the ship!

213
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,850
It's a great ship! I'll take good care of it!

214
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,270
If you want these shorts back,

215
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,070
you'll have to join us!

216
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,560
You brought me out into this big world!

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,160
We'll cross many seas and have
tons of battles and challenges.

218
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,980
And when we get to the end of the sea,

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,990
I will call it "the ship of dreams."

220
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,820
Hey, Luffy.

221
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,880
The Thousand Sunny still
has some life in her.

222
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,930
You're the only captain who can make it...

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,640
..."the ship of dreams."

224
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,850
I'll acquire skills that'll enable us to have

225
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,590
an even more harrowing adventure than before.

226
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,110
So Luffy...!

227
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,490
Hey, the tiger is burning.

228
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,880
Ow, ow, ow, ow...!

229
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,040
What is that?!

230
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,830
A monster?! Watch out!

231
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,330
So Luffy, we have to get over
the rough sea of the New World!

232
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,240
This incident will be known
around the Grand Line

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
as the Legend of Baldimore's
Sacred Burning Beast.

234
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,550
At the Kamabakka Kingdom, Grand Line...

235
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,390
Hey, what was it you saw in the newspaper?

236
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,720
I see!

237
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,560
You got so calm all of the sudden.

238
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,160
I received Luffy's message because it's
exclusively for his friends,

239
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,150
from the newspaper.

240
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,400
If you don't believe that I'm his
friend, I'm not gonna tell you, fool!

241
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,740
This guy's annoying!

242
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,910
Hey, who made this meal?

243
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,580
Oh, you have quite a discriminating palate!

244
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,210
It tastes good and oddly, I feel
like I'm overflowing with energy!

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,630
That's right! It's a dish of aggression!

246
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,650
There are a lot of chefs who
can make that on this island!

247
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,550
--Yes!
--Yes!

248
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,590
--Yes!
--Yes!

249
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,020
Yes!

250
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,100
Look at the beautiful tough
bodies of these candies!

251
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,230
And their gentle hearts.

252
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,860
The candies grew like this by
eating the dish of aggression!

253
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,030
What you eat is important for your condition,

254
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,240
physique, and personality!

255
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
It builds the whole human body!

256
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,250
If all the people in the
world drink milk everyday...

257
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,940
there'll be less crime - don't you agree?

258
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,510
So, it's good to be aggressive!

259
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,680
Food builds body? I never
thought about it that way.

260
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,240
I can help them building their
bodies with daily meals.

261
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,900
But besides that,

262
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,610
what'll I do if Nami-san and Robin-chan
get sexier than they are now?!

263
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,280
--What should we do with this guy?
--What should I do?!

264
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm burning with passion!

265
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Teach me how to cook the dish of aggression!

266
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,830
The answer is "No!!"

267
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,920
Ouch...

268
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,340
That was very wishful thinking!

269
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,590
This "99 - Vital Recipe" is...

270
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,140
...a part of the New Kama Kempo
techniques - Training for Married Life!

271
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,230
I can't just teach it to a nobody like you!

272
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,350
If you wanna learn it, you gotta
have a girlish heart and...

273
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,550
...learn the New Kama Kempo!

274
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,110
No way!

275
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,860
I wasn't born to become friends with ladies.

276
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,830
I was born to...

277
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,790
...love ladies!

278
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,250
Gah!

279
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,910
Heehaw!

280
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,720
You're quite a reasonable man. I like you!

281
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,470
Okay, I'll give you a chance!

282
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,840
A chance?

283
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,390
I'll hand out the recipes to 99 grand masters

284
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,730
of the New Kama Kempo on this island.

285
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,900
If you're a real pirate, get
all the recipes from them!

286
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,200
However, every new kamas on this island

287
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,740
will try to put this sweet
dress on you day and night!

288
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,250
I wonder if you can maintain your manhood.

289
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,750
--Sanji-kun!
--We won't let you sleep!

290
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,710
The sweet dress!

291
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,680
I'll bring back the exciting
feelings of wearing skirts!

292
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,070
Sanji! It's nice to be girly!

293
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,430
You...

294
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,520
...vs. the home of the New Kama Kempo!

295
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,730
If you can win this fight, I'll give
you a ship, too! You can have it all!

296
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,490
So what do you say?!

297
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,450
Hey you, cook!

298
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,040
Join my group!

299
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,870
Huh?

300
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,710
Be the cook on my pirate ship!

301
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,380
I won't die.

302
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,390
I'm not gonna die here.

303
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,390
You see idiots like that
every once in a while...

304
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,410
ones who will fight to the death once
they've set their eyes on a target...

305
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,330
I can't hear your answer -
does that mean you give up?

306
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,520
Yeah, if you lose...

307
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,160
When I win...

308
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:36,290
When I beat all of them, I bet I'll
be much stronger than I am now.

309
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,460
Even if hundreds of weapons are built in,

310
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,950
he can be defeated by someone with
a spear of blind determination.

311
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Hey, Luffy, don't lose.

312
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,160
But I'm hoping to go some
day... to the Grand Line.

313
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,710
Then let's go now.

314
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,730
It's not the right time yet.

315
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,840
--Say... do you know the All Blue?
--No...

316
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,910
Oh, you don't?! It's a miracle sea!

317
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,330
We both have foolish dreams.

318
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,500
Hm?

319
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,880
In order to achieve my goal, the All Blue...

320
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Sanji?

321
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,140
Yeah. I'll come along... on your journey
to become "King of the Pirates"!

322
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,980
What?

323
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,230
I'll be the cook for your ship.

324
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,440
Luffy, if I can see you again...

325
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,810
...I'll...

326
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,330
I'll give you the greatest
support in the world as a cook

327
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,560
so you can become the King of the Pirates!

328
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,850
After...

329
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,910
...I live through...

330
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,060
...this hell!

331
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,980
I accept...

332
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,800
...the challenge!

333
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,880
Great! We won't go easy on you!

334
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,410
I'm looking forward to it!

335
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,020
Alright, let's do it!

336
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,900
Sanji-kun!

337
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,860
Don't give me the cold shoulder!

338
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,110
--Shut up!
--Otherwise...

339
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,700
I can't lose here!

340
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,540
No!

341
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,460
Doesn't work!

342
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,050
I got you!

343
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,260
I'm not gonna lose either, Luffy!

344
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,020
I'll fight you now!

345
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,190
Get the recipe from me - Caroline!

346
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,200
This is great!

347
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,570
I'm gonna get revenge for the other day!

348
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,660
Here I come!

349
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,750
I will win!

350
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,170
Luffy's messages have
reached his friends safely.

351
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,120
Taking Luffy's feelings to their own hearts,

352
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,890
his friends make a decision
toward pursuing a new goal.

353
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,280
They meet at the captain's side once more,

354
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,480
their sights set on the day they'll
set out on a new adventure!

355
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

356
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,870
"I Will Get Much, Much Stronger!
Zoro's Pledge to His Captain!"

357
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,100
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
