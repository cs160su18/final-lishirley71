2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,190
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,950
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,870
Inside the bay, Luffy and the Whitebeards
are trying to get to the scaffold

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,540
but the Navy stands in their
way. The battle is heating up!

63
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,830
I'm sorry, "Red-Haired."

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,380
I will not hold back my power.

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,880
That's...

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,220
..."Hawk-Eye!"

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,910
Now, I wonder if fate...

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
...will end the life of the child
of the next generation here.

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Or, if it will save him
from this Black Sword!

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
"The Great Swordsman Mihawk! Luffy Comes
Under the Attack of the Black Sword!"

71
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,950
I don't have time to face such a strong guy.

72
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,250
I'm here to save Ace!

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,840
Second Gear!

74
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,430
Heehaw!

75
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,310
Death Wink!

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,400
Galaxy Wink!

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,950
That's it, Straw boy.

78
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,950
Just focus on advancing.

79
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,620
We'll handle the rest!

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,130
--We'll get this guy!
--Heehaw!

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,140
"Hawk-Eye," do you remember us?!

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,680
We're the guys who challenged you once!

83
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,310
But now we're powered up as New Kamas!

84
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,490
I don't remember the face of every worm.

85
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,720
Great! Just gotta keep running and...

86
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,820
You are in range.

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,830
Ow... Ouch! I got cut!

88
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,970
Only Ace-san's brother could avoid
getting a fatal wound like that.

89
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,680
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

90
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,090
I won't let you so much
as touch Luffy-kun again!

91
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,980
Even if it means death!

92
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,690
Why are you doing this?

93
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,850
I want to rescue Ace-san!

94
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,400
For one reason, to save our sea!

95
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,030
It is too late to stop this war
now but we still have hope.

96
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,080
Namely, Luffy-kun over there.

97
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,750
I understand. But I still don't
know what fate has in store.

98
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,790
Therefore, I need you to step back.

99
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,880
Fish-Man Karate!

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,050
Arabesque Brick Fist!

101
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,950
Sharkskin Palm Thrust!

102
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,870
Shark Brick Fist!

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,550
He's really strong as I thought.

104
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,650
"Hawk-Eye" is in the sky!

105
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,740
You bastard!

106
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,160
Gum-Gum...

107
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,190
...Jet Bazoo...!

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,010
That was close! If I had reached
out, my arms would've been severed!

109
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,600
You could be level-headed.

110
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,380
He sliced the mountain of ice
with just the swing of a sword!

111
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,470
S-So this is what the world's
strongest swordsman can do!

112
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,480
How strong is he?!

113
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,900
Straw Hat's dead because he's the target now!

114
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,740
The blocks of ice are falling on us!

115
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,800
Stealthy footsteps oily feet.

116
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,550
Ready, guys?

117
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,260
Let's get the "Make Captain Buggy a Star
in Front of Everyone" plan in action!

118
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,480
I know that they're broadcasting
the war to the whole world.

119
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,610
There must be a Video
Transponder Snail somewhere.

120
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,480
Find it!

121
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,150
Yeah!

122
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,240
"Find it?" "Yeah?" I don't think
that things are that simple.

123
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,830
Team up? Me and you?

124
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,590
Yes. The reign of outdated pirates
like Whitebeard will end soon.

125
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,100
And the new era will be our era
where power conquers everything.

126
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,350
Don't you wanna get a piece of it?

127
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,860
Not bad, is it?

128
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,280
Your title has been stripped away but...

129
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,030
...when you get down to it,
we're both Warlords, aren't we?

130
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,270
You better stop looking at
me as if I'm on par with you.

131
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,500
You should be pledging
to work under me instead.

132
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,090
I thought that you became a better person

133
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,560
in hell--Impel Down, the great prison!

134
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,640
If so, then I wouldn't be here now.

135
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,510
Sables!

136
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Get lost, Flamingo shit!

137
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,320
I thought that you could be reasoned with.

138
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,870
If you don't fight the Navy, it's easy!

139
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,250
We can breeze through!

140
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
B-Breeze through! Breeze...!

141
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,880
Captain Buggy!

142
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,680
He got caught up in the whirlwind
of someone else's fight!

143
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,270
You're not gonna move aside
at any cost, Hancock?

144
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,230
Of course not! I won't let
you hurt my beloved husband!

145
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,520
Husband?

146
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,740
Yes, my husband!

147
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,910
After the wedding, we will go on a honeymoon!

148
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,040
It's a sweet sweet honeymoon
with Luffy my love!

149
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,060
But what if...

150
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,140
It's about time to eat.

151
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,140
But the food storage is empty.

152
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,940
There are a lot of things
that we can catch and eat!

153
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,400
My honey! I wanna eat your homemade dishes!

154
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,320
Okay! If you want it... Could
you give me a little time?

155
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,620
If things go like that,

156
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,250
I'll have to make tons of dishes

157
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,560
that could satisfy Luffy's
appetite all by myself!

158
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,300
Snake Princess-sama! Let us make it for you!

159
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,980
Luffy wants to eat my homemade
dishes! Keep your hands away!

160
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,630
Honey! Isn't it ready yet?

161
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,280
--It's coming!
--How admirable!

162
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,110
I'm ready for any trouble.
Because I'm... I'm...

163
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,660
...his wife!

164
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,440
"Wife?"

165
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,750
I don't know if she wants to fight or not.

166
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,790
I'll get Straw Hat!

167
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,590
I told you, you outrageous fool, that
I won't let you pass through here!

168
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,170
Perfume Femur!

169
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,890
Hancock! You...!

170
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,770
What are you gonna do now?!

171
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,610
You're getting farther from your brother!

172
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,950
Damn!

173
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,240
So this is it after all.

174
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,760
Breeze through! Breeze! Breeze!

175
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,890
His fighting capability has improved
a bit but I've already seen it all.

176
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,980
I won't miss it again from this distance!

177
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,440
Don't mind me! Just breezing through!

178
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,530
Gum-Gum...

179
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,410
Oh, you save...

180
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,370
...Jet Human Shield!

181
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,000
You! What're you doing?! Straw Hat!

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,460
What?! I'm not the one who cut you!

183
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,320
Plus you just said "Don't mind
me! I'm here to save you!"

184
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,670
How deluded is your hearing?

185
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,200
--Gum-Gum Human Shield!
--Stop it!

186
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,390
I can't take it! You must be "Hawk-Eye!"

187
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,460
The Special Muggy Ball! Blow away!

188
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,840
Here's a joke!

189
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,240
How is the Muggy Ball useful
for tunnel construction?

190
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,620
And the answer is?

191
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,120
Say it together, everyone! Because it goes...

192
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,450
BOOM!

193
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,580
Great, Buggy!

194
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,790
--Yeah, red nose!
--That was a good one!

195
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,750
Thank you, Buggy! I'll
never forget about you!

196
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,880
It's far from over!

197
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,060
Vista, Pops said that we
can't let Ace's brother die!

198
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,480
Back him up!

199
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,440
I got it! Count on me!

200
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,620
5th division commander of the
Whitebeards - Flower Sword Vista!

201
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,000
Nice to meet you, "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk.

202
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,910
You've heard of me?

203
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,250
Everybody knows you.

204
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,880
That was close! Who is that old guy?

205
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,840
It's not because of his power or skills!

206
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,100
Whatever! Thank you!

207
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,460
He seems to rally all those
around him to his side!

208
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,510
Stay at it! Straw boy!

209
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,300
He made it through fine.

210
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,350
Luffy! Save your brother!

211
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,290
Outta my way!

212
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,190
Among all people on the sea,

213
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,560
he has the most formidable ability!

214
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,780
Ace!

215
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,750
S-Straw Hat! I'll get even with you!

216
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,920
You're great, Captain Buggy!

217
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,200
You pretended that you were beaten by

218
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,680
"Hawk-Eye" but shrewdly executed the plan!

219
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,880
What do you mean?

220
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,640
Don't play dumb, Captain Buggy!

221
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,880
Video Transponder Snail?!

222
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,810
Y-Yeah, that's right!

223
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,850
A hero who can change the world is someone

224
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,830
who can open his own way to
the future by his own hands!

225
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,630
I'll follow you to the end, Captain Buggy!

226
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,780
Shh...

227
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,900
Yeah!

228
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,710
Now, the important part begins here.

229
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,470
How optimistic can you be?

230
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,730
As time ticks down toward the execution,

231
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,300
shocking truths have been
revealed one after another.

232
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,140
From the great, iron-tight prison Impel Down,

233
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,190
surprisingly more than 200 people had escaped

234
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,320
and those same notorious prisoners
have been caught up in the war.

235
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,950
The expanse of the battlefield
is an unearthly site.

236
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,370
It's certainly the showdown at the
summit that will change history!

237
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,400
People all over the world can do nothing...

238
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,710
...but follow the war that
will change their future

239
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,560
that seems so changeable now.

240
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,950
Fleet Admiral, we are all set.

241
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,070
Those at the bay area, too?

242
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,490
Yes, everything.

243
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,500
Huh?

244
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,920
They're getting ready for the execution.

245
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,540
Those bastards!

246
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,670
What are they gonna do to
Ace? It's not time yet!

247
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,510
Will it begin already?!

248
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,810
That's impossible! It's
before the announced time!

249
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,110
Cut the connection of the Video
Transponder Snail right away!

250
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,160
We the Navy and the World Government

251
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,820
must win this war in the
name of absolute justice!

252
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,870
No matter what it takes.

253
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,330
But it's too much to see,
for this naive world.

254
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,800
We don't have to show them the horrific
images that will unfold here soon.

255
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,440
Pops...

256
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,300
Hurry up!

257
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,510
They're really gonna
execute Ace ahead of time!

258
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,430
Ace!

259
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,690
The news that will go around
the world afterwards...

260
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,690
...should be of our victory and only that!

261
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,620
Our ships!

262
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,420
Look at the bay head! There's something!

263
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,930
They're not our buddies!

264
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,730
The Navy soldiers must've
gotten around the ice wall!

265
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,900
They still have soldiers
who can destroy big ships?

266
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,280
That's...!

267
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,820
Wh-What are they?!

268
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,200
So that's the Government's
human weapon that I heard of.

269
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,800
The bear guy from the Sabaody!

270
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,920
There're so many of them!

271
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,560
K-Kuma?

272
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,600
An hour and a half since the war began,

273
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
the Navy makes a big move!

274
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,710
The tide of the war changes

275
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,630
its course quickly and
flows into its final stage!

276
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,950
Alright, guys! I'm getting tired of waiting!

277
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,000
It's showtime!

278
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,210
The Whitebeard Pirates and the Navy

279
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,880
seem to have fallen into
a stalemate as neither

280
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,140
force can manage to get the upper hand.

281
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,850
But then an army of human weapons that
look like Bartholomew Kuma appears,

282
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,600
and the Whitebeard Pirates and Luffy
are under attack from both sides.

283
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,950
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,230
"The Extermination Strategy in Action!
The Power of the Pacifistas!"

285
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
