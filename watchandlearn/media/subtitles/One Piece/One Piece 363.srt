2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,730
One-Sword Style!

48
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,150
Soaring Dragon...

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,560
Three-Pace Hum...

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,110
...Notch Slash!

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,530
...Blaze!

52
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,120
I have lost.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,590
Once, a legendary samurai
wielded the great sword Shusui.

54
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,930
I am sure this katana would be
happy to have you as its master.

55
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,570
I'll take your sword, but I'll pretend
that our duel never happened...

56
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,570
...samurai of the Wano Kingdom!

57
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,520
"Chopper Is Furious!!
Hogback's Evil Medical Practices!"

58
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,570
Tell me: How does it feel to be
subjugated by the might of your friends?

59
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,040
I can't believe you tried to stuff salt
down my throat with your weird powers!

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,880
They're strong!

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,250
Darn it! I never expected
Sanji to kick Robin.

62
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,740
He isn't Sanji anymore!

63
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Who is that Sanji guy?
Don't make me kill you, jerk face.

64
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm afraid they don't have a single
memory of your days as crewmates!

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,060
Occasionally fresh zombies retain
some of the shadow's feelings,

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,060
but these shadows have
fully settled into their bodies.

67
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,030
They've completely lost their human hearts.

68
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,700
They've become zombies that
will obey my every command!

69
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,450
As far as zombies are concerned,
their orders are absolute!

70
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,790
I'm actually happy... to see that
you're rotten to the core, Hogback!

71
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,420
In all actuality, you have
saved countless lives.

72
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,300
I really did respect you as a doctor.

73
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,620
The same goes for your zombie research.

74
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,470
Death can come suddenly...

75
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm sure there are a lot
of things the deceased

76
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,070
and those they left behind
never got a chance to say.

77
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,790
I'm not asking for years. If they
could have just a few minutes!

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,840
If there was a way to bring back the dead...

79
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,230
...even if people cast stones,
calling it "evil medicine"...

80
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,790
...it would mean the world to those it saved!

81
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,090
So when you said that you were
researching how to "resurrect the dead,"

82
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,920
I thought that you truly
were an amazing doctor.

83
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,930
Fool! Why would I go to
such lengths for others?

84
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,520
You said that you respected how I used
to save lives, but it was the same deal!

85
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,770
I was simply a genius!

86
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,230
I conducted operations for money,

87
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,980
but there was no stopping
the unwanted flood of patients

88
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,620
that came from around
the world for treatment!

89
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,490
"Save my dad!"

90
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,790
"Save my child!"

91
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,330
"Save my beloved!"

92
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,170
It got old!

93
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,170
It was a pain!

94
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,090
The run-of-the-mill quack
couldn't save them, but I could.

95
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,630
Can you understand the hardships of a genius?

96
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,560
You're free to respect me if you want.

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,850
But your disappointment is uncalled for.

98
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,650
If you can't forgive me as a doctor
because I don't match your ideals,

99
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,560
then you never understood me
to begin with, stupid reindeer!

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,440
Are you going to start
lecturing me on medical ethics?!

101
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,490
I wouldn't dream of it!

102
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,660
I don't consider you a doctor!

103
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,620
What?!

104
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,330
The same goes for these zombies.

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,710
All you've done is reanimate the dead.

106
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,400
They aren't alive!

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,330
Don't take life so lightly!

108
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,880
You can be rather cruel.

109
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,590
They're moving right before your very eyes,
and you think they aren't alive?

110
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,930
Yeah, you heard me!

111
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,270
Dr. Chopper, the "dead" are being given
a second shot at life. It's a miracle!

112
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,820
Why would you want to reject these lives?

113
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,150
Behold!

114
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,950
Don't move.

115
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,580
Now start licking the floor, Cindry.

116
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,920
Okay, Hogback-sama.

117
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,120
Didn't you see that room, Dr. Chopper?

118
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,630
That is my room.

119
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,860
The numerous photos were of the stage
actress Victoria Cindry before she died.

120
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,400
I had been in love with
her for a very long time.

121
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,270
I wasn't the only one. Her beauty had
charmed men from across the country.

122
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,120
There!

123
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,160
You're all set, Doctor.

124
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,450
S-S-Sorry! I shouldn't make a
patient sew a button back on.

125
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,290
It's all right.

126
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,850
Thanks to you, I'll be
able to go back on stage.

127
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,850
Thank you very much.

128
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,560
Father! Mother! Sorry to
have kept you waiting.

129
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,730
Uh, excuse me...

130
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,990
Despite her popularity,
she was down to earth.

131
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,360
She was close to her family...

132
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,000
She was kind to everyone...
A truly wonderful woman.

133
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,880
But that woman...

134
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,940
...rejected my proposal,
when my renown as a doctor

135
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,790
had let me obtain anything I wanted.

136
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,740
She already had a fiancé.

137
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,000
And shortly thereafter, I caught wind
of some news that left me dumbfounded.

138
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,130
Cindry had died in an accident.

139
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,460
I felt drained.

140
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,420
I ultimately abandoned my work.

141
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,050
That is when he came.
A giant man appeared before me.

142
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,400
It was my master, Gecko Moria!

143
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,220
Dr. Hogback, lend me a hand!

144
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,990
And I boarded this ship under the condition

145
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,860
that he would use his miraculous
ability to resurrect Cindry!

146
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,250
I stole her body...

147
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,970
It was so easy to obtain the actress,
Cindry, and bend her to my will!

148
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,400
Cindry-chan!

149
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,040
I wish plates would cease to exist.

150
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,350
Plates?!

151
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,360
The personality of the woman who had
spurned me was of little consequence.

152
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,170
As long as she retained her beauty...

153
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,210
That is the zombie, Cindry-chan!

154
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Of course I'm thrilled,
but I'm sure she is as well!

155
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,190
She gets to live in this
world as a human again.

156
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,740
How could you call her a human?

157
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,580
Make her stop licking the floor!

158
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,090
When a human's heart isn't linked
to her body, she is no longer human!

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,840
By using corpses that can't
stick up for themselves,

160
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,430
you're creating nothing but monsters!

161
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,600
For every zombie you create,
you're making a person miserable!

162
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,520
I figured that out, which is
why I can't forgive you guys!

163
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,990
Don't lecture me on life when you're
a mediocre doctor, pirate reindeer!

164
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,620
Cindry-chan, finish those two off!

165
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,450
Okay.

166
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,090
I'm going to turn you guys into marios!

167
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,340
Rejoice, Dr. Chopper! Once you are dead,

168
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,470
I will make you my assistant,
since you admire me so much.

169
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,600
Square Plate Blades!

170
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,680
One! Two! Three!

171
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,330
Stop it...!

172
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,920
Damn you!

173
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,940
Chopper!

174
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,790
Don't underestimate her
just because she's a woman!

175
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,870
I've enhanced her muscles for combat.

176
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,790
You don't have to listen to
that monster! Ow, ow, ow...

177
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,880
I will kill you!

178
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,390
You poor thing! And here you're already dead.

179
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,100
How would the family you left behind
feel if they knew about this?

180
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,560
Let go of me!

181
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,640
If your family saw you covered in stitches

182
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,060
and being used as an expendable soldier,

183
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,400
it would tear them apart!

184
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,070
Let go of me!

185
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,410
The heart you were born and
raised with is already dead,

186
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,800
but your body is being forced
to do the bidding of others.

187
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,080
What the hell?!

188
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,790
Are you questioning your eyes? Face facts!

189
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,260
This is mankind's eternal dream!
I've resurrected the dead!

190
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,010
The dead can come back to life!

191
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Is the ability to move all that matters?

192
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,890
Humans are freer than that!

193
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,310
You're the one who treats them
like they aren't humans!

194
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,960
Robin, hurry and feed her salt!

195
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,460
Right!

196
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,670
Dogguin! Jigoro! Help Cindry out!

197
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,380
Take out the pests!

198
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,350
I failed! Chopper!

199
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,530
Three-Sword Style...

200
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
...108-Pound Phoenix!

201
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,820
Stop it, Zoro!

202
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,040
Doce Fleurs!

203
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,750
Not... her again!

204
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Take out... the pests!

205
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,970
--Jerk!
--Huh?

206
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:52,860
Why did you attack me along
with them?! Don't be a pest!

207
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,900
Now you're asking for it!

208
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,570
That's how I feel!

209
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,520
The pests are supposed to get taken outside!

210
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,130
Then get going! He issued that order to me!

211
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,870
It was meant for me!

212
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,630
I just said he issued it to me!

213
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,870
Jerk!

214
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,300
Hey! What are you two doing?

215
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,100
Hey, knock it off! You
need to actually work--

216
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,470
--Robin!
--On it!

217
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,230
Isn't this turning out to be fascinating?

218
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,900
You ordered them to "take out the pests."

219
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,580
They are obediently trying to
obey that order even as I speak.

220
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,420
I wonder what would happen
if you didn't issue a new order.

221
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,380
Even without their memories,
those two are still like water and oil...

222
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,970
Unbelievable.

223
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,640
Isn't this a rather tall tower?

224
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,320
Huh?

225
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,720
Why don't you order the two
of us to jump out the window?

226
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,790
Robin...?

227
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,290
What's gotten into you?

228
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,500
I'll say that as many times as you like!

229
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,960
Jump! Jump! I want you to
jump out the window together!

230
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,620
--Sure.
--Huh?

231
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,770
No, not you! Wait!

232
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,990
Run faster! He wants us to jump out together.

233
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,610
Don't tell me what to do!

234
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,420
We don't want to.

235
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,580
I won't forget this!

236
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,300
You tricked me! You're horrible!
You're the scum of all mankind!

237
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,050
Luffy will purify all of the
zombies when he defeats Moria.

238
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,460
You're the one I want to throttle, Hogback!

239
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,520
C-C-Cindry! Buy me some time!
I'm gonna run for the hills!

240
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,520
Where is my answer? I'll give you
another shadow if they take you out.

241
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,980
Don't worry about dying!

242
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,010
What the--?!

243
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,540
I cannot...

244
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,150
move.

245
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,360
C-Cindry!

246
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,410
He's here! He's here!

247
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,080
Well, now you get to meet him...

248
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
...Straw Hat.

249
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,540
He's huge! This is my shadow?

250
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,590
So he has finally decided to submit to me!

251
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,890
Tell me: Who is your master?

252
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,310
My master is Moria-sama.

253
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

254
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,940
"Oars Roars! Come Out, Straw Hat Crew!"

255
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
