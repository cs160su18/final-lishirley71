2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,360
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

49
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,020
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,630
He and the Whitebeards have invaded
the plaza to make it to the scaffold!

51
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,900
In the midst of the Navy's onslaught,
with the Whitebeards' assistance,

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,040
Luffy finally freed Ace! However...

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,000
Watch what I do.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,830
Wait!

55
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,340
Luffy!

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,740
"Looking for the Answer! Fire Fist
Ace Dies on the Battlefield!"

57
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,840
Ace...

58
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,300
Ace!

59
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,690
Ace!

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,180
Ace-san!

61
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,610
Ace!

62
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,540
He's been beaten! Dammit!

63
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,050
Stop Akainu!

64
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,810
Can't believe it!

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,260
Hurry up! Do something about these handcuffs!

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm trying but... Damn, I can't break them!

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,490
Oh yeah! He can do it!

68
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,500
--He?
--Yeah, the guy who uncuffed Ace!

69
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,620
I'll make the key! Uncuff him right away!

70
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah, you're right! Bring him here now!

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,820
Okay!

72
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,460
Fire!

73
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,400
How's this war going to end?

74
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,710
We made you pay for what you've done to
Ace! Have you learned a lesson, Akainu?

75
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,330
No way! Is he a monster?!

76
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,190
Looks like you're still alive!

77
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,430
"Fire Fist" Ace!

78
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,360
Don't do it...

79
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,370
Don't do it!

80
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,910
Ace!

81
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,670
I can't believe you let your
guard down, Whitebeard!

82
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,010
I won't let you interrupt!

83
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,470
Brat!

84
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,650
Jimbei!

85
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,990
You can't touch him anymore!

86
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:38,410
You're just delaying the inevitable,
Jimbei! Since you were once a Warlord,

87
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,120
I bet you know what I'm capable of!

88
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,670
I'd be happy to risk my
life if I can delay it!

89
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,210
I've been ready to die from the beginning!

90
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,760
Jimbei!

91
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,180
Marco! He's here!

92
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,060
Gee, thank you for helping
me! I almost got killed...

93
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,180
Cut the crap and uncuff me now!

94
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,030
V-Vice Admiral Garp!

95
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you...?

96
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,870
Garp!

97
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,300
What are you doing?! Are
you losing your mind?!

98
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,290
You better keep holding me
down like that, Sengoku!

99
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,310
Because if you don't, I will kill Sakazuki!

100
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,600
You fool!

101
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,400
Looks like I need to execute a traitor, too!

102
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,240
Jimbei, get down!

103
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,780
How annoying!

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,760
So you guys are Haki users!

105
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,670
How could we let that happen?!

106
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,430
I couldn't have more regret about it!

107
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,690
Can't you see that it's too
late to save "Fire Fist?!"

108
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,310
Take a look!

109
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,250
Ace...

110
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,300
Hey, are you all right? Hey.

111
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,980
Ace, you need to get treated right away!

112
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,150
I'm sorry, Luffy...

113
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,700
Huh?

114
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
In order to save me,

115
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,040
you pushed yourself that far but...

116
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,000
...I couldn't make it all the way.

117
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,970
Wh-What are you saying?

119
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't be ridiculous!

120
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,230
Somebody, treat him!

121
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,930
Please! Please help Ace!

122
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,350
Hey somebody! Help Ace! Please!

123
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,110
--Hurry! This way! Give him first aid now!
--Okay!

124
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,820
Straw boy...

125
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,410
Ace! Are you alright?!

126
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,870
Hurry up and treat him!

127
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,200
Okay, let me see the wound!

128
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,770
Please!

129
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,920
This is...!

130
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,960
Huh?

131
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,010
Hey.

132
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,680
What's the matter? Hurry up and help him!

133
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,430
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,470
What do you mean by that?

135
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,980
What's going on?! Just do something!

136
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,110
Hey, aren't you a doctor?! Hey!

137
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,770
It's no use.

138
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,530
My organs have been burned.

139
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,490
I can't hold out any longer.

140
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,750
I can tell that my life is ending.

141
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,560
That's not true!

142
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,320
Oh yeah, Ivan-chan!

143
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Hey, I beg you!

144
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,130
Inject that stuff into Ace! Please!

145
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,430
Like you did to me, why can't you help Ace?!

146
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,480
Hey, I beg you! Please! Help! Help Ace!

147
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,230
Please inject that into Ace...

148
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,520
Straw boy!

149
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,570
Ace boy... can't make it!

150
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
Huh? No way.

151
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,450
You promised me!

152
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,810
You said...

153
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,330
...that you'd never die...

154
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,440
...no matter what!

155
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,720
Ace!!

156
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,520
Ace...

157
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,920
What did you say?

158
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,920
You can't hold out any longer?

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,090
You promised me...

160
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,470
...that you'd never die...

161
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,180
...no matter what, Ace!

162
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,870
Do I even deserve to have been born?

163
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,540
What if Gold Roger had a child?

164
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,820
Of course I know what'd happen to him!

165
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,630
He'd get his head cut off for sure!

166
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,510
No way! I'm not content if
we kill him that easily!

167
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,280
How about we prick him with a needle

168
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,150
once for every grudge that
someone holds against Roger?!

169
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,030
No way! Instead, we'll burn him alive first

170
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:34,190
and humiliate him prior to death
in front of the whole world!

171
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,740
That's nice!

172
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,890
Everybody will say "that serves him right!"

173
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,340
I want to hear from him as he dies:

174
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,050
"I'm sorry I was born! I'm
just a piece of trash!"

175
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,220
But I don't think that he ever had a child!

176
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,190
No one wanted me to be born.

177
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,680
Ace! You caused trouble in the city again!

178
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,650
They're making a fuss about
it! Don't give us a hard time!

179
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,040
Hey! Are you listening, Ace?!

180
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,290
--Shut up, Dadan!
--What'd you say?!

181
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,090
If I were stronger, I would
have killed all of them!

182
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,390
I wouldn't even have a will to live...

183
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:48,310
...if it weren't for Sabo and a
high-maintenance brother like you.

184
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh yeah. If you see Dadan
someday, say hello for me.

185
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,040
When I face my own death, I
even miss a woman like her.

186
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,720
Like I said, don't say that you're gonna die!

187
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,930
There is one thing that makes me wanna stay.

188
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,920
That is my desire to see
you fulfill your dream.

189
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,840
But I'm sure that you can do it!

190
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,160
Because you're my brother!

191
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,450
That day...

192
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,080
Listen, Luffy.

193
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,840
We have to live without leaving any regrets.

194
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,920
Uh-huh.

195
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,720
We gotta go out to sea someday...

196
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,350
...and live as we like.

197
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,930
Freer than anyone else.

198
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,820
Like we promised that
day, I have no regret...

199
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,870
...in my life.

200
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,080
That's a lie! Don't tell a lie!

201
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,870
I'm not lying.

202
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:34,090
Something tells me that what
I truly wanted was not fame.

203
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,760
Did I deserve to be born?

204
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,760
What I wanted was the
answer for that question.

205
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,310
Become my son!

206
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,360
You better tell me that my
beloved son is all right.

207
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm your brother!

208
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,110
You can say whatever you want!

209
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,370
I'm gonna save you even if it means death!

210
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,960
Guys! Rescue Ace and...

211
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,090
...destroy the Navy!!

212
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm gonna get Ace back!!

213
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,640
Finally...

214
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,060
I made it! Ace!

215
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,960
Just tell me one thing.

216
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,970
Are you happy to have me as your father?

217
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,090
I can't raise my voice to let
everybody hear me anymore.

218
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,920
Could you tell them...

219
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,430
...what I'm about to say now?

220
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,880
Pops!

221
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,410
Everybody!

222
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,370
And you Luffy.

223
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,840
Thank you...

224
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,010
...for loving someone like
me who is good for nothing...

225
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,970
...and who has such bad blood in his veins...

226
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,400
...up to today.

227
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,820
Thank you!

228
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
Old man.

229
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,370
Huh?

230
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,340
Do you think...

231
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,050
...that I deserved to be born?

232
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,010
That's something...

233
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,560
...you'll see as you live.

234
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,050
Ace...

235
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,070
Ace...

236
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,640
It is a reality difficult to accept.

237
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,220
Ace's death cruelly unfolds
before Luffy's eyes.

238
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,900
But the battle does not pause.

239
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,960
As the pursuit intensifies,

240
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,060
Whitebeard's rage shakes all of Marineford!

241
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

242
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,170
"The Navy Headquarters Falls!
Whitebeard's Unspeakable Wrath!"

243
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
