2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,600
People are terrified when they hear "zombie."

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,350
But what if I rephrase it
to "resurrecting the dead"?

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,270
Hasn't that been all mankind's eternal dream?

50
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,110
Everyone has a special someone or two
they'd like to see return from the dead.

51
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,610
But toying with human mortality is
unorthodox medicine that disrespects God!

52
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,950
That's why I slipped away
from the public eye--

53
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,250
so I could continue my
research on this island in secret!

54
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,370
S-So that's the story!

55
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,630
But I'm sure tons of people
around the world would be thrilled

56
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,840
if your research is a success!

57
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,630
I'll be rooting for you, Dr. Hogback!

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,350
You're rather open-minded!
Thank you, Dr. Chopper.

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,660
What?!

60
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,230
Sh-Shucks, Doctor! I'm not happy because
you thanked me or anything, you jerk!

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
May I have your autograph?

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,570
Why, certainly!

63
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,740
"To Dr. Chopper..."

64
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,740
To Dr. Chopper...

65
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Could you show me your lab later?

66
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,240
By all means, steer clear of my laboratory!

67
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,780
"Nami's in a Major Pinch! The Zombie
Mansion and the Invisible Man!"

68
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,890
Man, Nami! I wish you could
take a bath by yourself!

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,360
Seriously! I wanted to talk
with Dr. Hogback some more.

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,900
Shut your traps and come with me!

71
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,410
Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,630
I wanna take a peek...

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,320
What?! You do?! For real?!

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm not interested in a naked human woman,

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,640
but I wish I could peek
inside Dr. Hogback's lab...

76
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,850
I don't wanna see it! I'm too scared!

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
Gosh darn it, Nami! Why do we have
to stand guard while you clean up?

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,150
Don't bathe if you're scared!

79
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm amazed you don't care
that zombies touched you!

80
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,650
Nasty!

81
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,890
We're just gonna get dirty again. Right?

82
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,760
Right!

83
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,580
We're leaving as soon as night falls.

84
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
What?!

85
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,330
Whoa, there! Are you crazy, moron?!

86
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,920
Here.

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,210
He said we could spend the night!

88
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,170
Can't you see what'll happen if we
leave in the middle of the night?!

89
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,090
Anyway, we should try to stay put!

90
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,930
Luffy and the others are sure
to come save us. You hear me?

91
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm with him! I don't wanna go outside again!

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,140
I'm not going back in
the forest or graveyard!

93
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,360
It's the same whether
we're inside or outside.

94
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,690
Have you paid close
attention to this mansion?

95
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,570
Y-You don't mean...

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,370
Yep! If my gut feeling was right,

97
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,740
the halls and rooms were
filled with people's auras.

98
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,960
This mansion is already teeming with zombies.

99
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,440
Wh-Where were they?!

100
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,200
And if they're inside, that makes Hogback
the most suspicious person here.

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,390
He's lying to us...

102
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,840
There is no way he could live in this
zombie-filled mansion or on this island

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,310
if he wasn't connected to
those zombies in some way!

104
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,480
Wh-What do you think, Chopper?
If her speculation is right...

105
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,230
She's wrong! Dr. Hogback would
never do anything like that!

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,070
At any rate, let's play ignorant.
Once it's night, we'll make our break.

107
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,990
You're a rather clever woman.

108
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,260
Huh? What was that?

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,500
Usopp? Chopper? Did you say something?

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,430
Huh? We didn't say anything.

111
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,630
Ah, I just farted!

112
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,960
Usopp, that stinks!

113
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,470
I'm Uso-P.U.!

114
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,350
Why, you--!

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,650
What's going on?!

116
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
I don't see anyone!

117
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,960
A beast...?

118
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,580
You're weaker than the woman
on the ship--more my type.

119
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,040
Someone's here?!

120
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,330
Usopp! Cho--

121
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,170
Woman, be my blushing bride!

122
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,300
Hey, Nami? Is there a problem?

123
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,770
Did Usopp's fart stink up the bathroom?

124
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,550
Thank you very much!

125
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,600
You just thanked her!

126
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,480
They're in the way...

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Stupid! Help me...!

128
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,230
Take that!

129
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,570
Usopp! Chopper! Help me!

130
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,260
"Evil Be Gone"

131
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,240
Someone's in here!

132
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,050
Huh?!

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,030
She's right! I'm picking up an odor!

134
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,620
"Evil Be Gone"

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,580
Huh? Uh, sorry!

136
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,620
I don't mean your fart!
It smells like a person.

137
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,830
Hurry! He's escaping out the window!

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,580
Why did the window suddenly open?

139
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,130
What the heck is escaping?!

140
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,630
Special Attack! Exploding Star!

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,430
It couldn't be...

142
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,300
Has that bastard... done it again...?

143
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,890
Wh-What should I do? Fire another one?

144
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,590
No, he's gone now.

145
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,480
I can't smell him anymore.

146
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,520
I wonder if we'll make it out of here...

147
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,230
Nami, are you okay?!

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,200
He overheard our entire conversation...

149
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,370
H-Hey, Nami, what was that all about?
I'm really confused here...

150
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,950
He was here the whole time.

151
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,290
He was an invisible man.

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,000
It's no use. It doesn't matter
if we kick or whack it.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,220
This massive spider web is here to stay.

154
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,760
I don't like this.

155
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,300
There is no point in staying here.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,350
We should make looking for Nami-san
our top priority. Let's head on out!

157
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,900
Hey, Zoro! Come on, Zoro!

158
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,980
Not only did that skeleton's ghost ship
and Sunny get caught in the web,

159
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,420
it also snared the Mini-Merry that
Usopp and the others were riding.

160
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,500
And it almost feels contrived
how the island entrance

161
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,690
is right in front of us,
like it's inviting us in.

162
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,840
Sheesh! I can practically see
the ghosts inside waving us in.

163
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,510
What are you griping about, Zoro?
C'mon, you're joining us!

164
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Do you want to fall for
that stupidly obvious trap

165
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,550
and have those idiots
treat you like a moron?!

166
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Why not? There's nothing
to do if we stay here!

167
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,350
Now let's go!

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,920
I'll share my lunch with you!

169
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,820
Sheesh! Well, I guess it might be fun
to see what those idiots look like.

170
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,700
All right! Let's move out!

171
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,250
You took forever, Moss Head!

172
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,910
Shut it!

173
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,040
Why does it go right into a staircase down?!

174
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,340
This is the entrance, so there's
no point thinking about it.

175
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,930
Oh, the ground is covered in bones!

176
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,250
Hmm. Cerberus, huh?

177
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,690
He would have been safer in Hell.

178
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,690
My, how cute!

179
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,990
Hey, isn't he lookin' for a fight?

180
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,030
He doesn't know his place.

181
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,360
Think he's yummy?

182
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,050
Woof!

183
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,590
Woof, woof! Woof! Woof, woof, woof!

184
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,880
Woof, woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof!

185
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,550
Hey, cool it...

186
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,180
Look. He's ready to fight.

187
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,770
Actually, he's found his
courage after getting cornered.

188
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,430
So it would seem.

189
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,100
Then I'll--

190
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Nah, wait.

191
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,980
Let's try to tame him.

192
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,690
What?!

193
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,530
Stupid! He may be a dog, but he's
basically the boss of all dogs.

194
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,740
But a dog is still a dog.

195
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,950
Yeah, good dog. Good dog.

196
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,950
Paw!

197
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,490
And here you just warned him!

198
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,420
There, there. You're a good dog.

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,550
There, there. Good dog. That's right.
Now let go nice and slow.

200
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,880
Slowly now. You're such a good doggie.

201
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,840
Darn mutt!

202
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,250
Down!

203
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,180
No, not quite...

204
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,520
But don't those injuries look horrible?

205
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,110
I'm amazed he's even alive.

206
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,990
Before that, I think that
fox thrown in the mix

207
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,530
makes it one messed-up animal...

208
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,780
We found such a fun animal
as soon as we arrived.

209
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,680
I can't wait to see what
this island has in store!

210
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,540
You look blue, Cerberus-san.

211
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,130
Hey, don't show the defeated any sympathy.

212
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,340
It'll hurt his pride.

213
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,920
Nami-san!

214
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,840
Hey! Where are you, Nami-san?!

215
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,060
--Nami-san!
--So the outside of the trench
leads to a forest, huh?

216
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,480
This place is like a maze!

217
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,920
Hey, Nami-san!

218
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,730
Nami-san!

219
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,490
Between the weird layout and this fog,
my sense of distance is fried!

220
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,040
There is also the possibility
that we're walking in circles.

221
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,220
Nami-san!

222
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,710
Maybe we should have left
Moss Head behind after all...

223
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,340
Are you pinning the blame on me?! Well?!

224
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,250
Huh?

225
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,440
A-An elderly tree and a
unicorn are sharing a drink!

226
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,400
--Save me!
--Wait!

227
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,150
Wait! Wait, dammit!

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,770
--Gum-Gum Butterfly Net!
--Strong Right!

229
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,250
Caught ya!

230
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,750
Please let me go!

231
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,920
Oh, dearie me!

232
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,210
Hey, Luffy! What are you
going to do with that?

233
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,050
He wouldn't...

234
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,630
Guys, why don't you join my pirate--

235
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,010
Cut that out!

236
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,440
That was a close call.

237
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,570
Hey, Absalom! You're here, aren't you?

238
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,320
What was all that ruckus about?

239
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,730
Were you in the bath again, you pervert?

240
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,040
I was searching for my bride, Hogback.

241
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
That woman tickles my fancy.

242
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,270
I'm going to make her mine!

243
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,920
Just so you know, she is a wanted woman.

244
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,530
You can't have her.

245
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,760
What did you say?!

246
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,140
There are six of them this time.

247
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,020
One of them is worth over 100 million.

248
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,900
The captain is worth 300 million.

249
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,550
300 million?!

250
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,480
Don't take those numbers so lightly, Perona.

251
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,320
If the government put 300 million
on his head, he's no ordinary pirate.

252
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,160
If you understand that much,

253
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,870
dedicate all of your energy to
capturing your prey, Absalom.

254
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,000
We're going to be busy tonight.

255
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,600
There's no such thing as an invisible man!

256
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,230
But I'm sure he was back there!

257
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,940
Not if he doesn't exist!

258
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,520
It was a hallucination or illusion!

259
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
You scared yourself into
thinking you saw the impossible!

260
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,610
What are you talking about, Usopp?!

261
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,660
Didn't you see how somebody
was pinning me down?!

262
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,990
Uh, er, well...

263
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,700
Nope, I didn't see that!

264
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,780
Yes, you did!

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,660
Gah, you're leading the witness!

266
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,040
You're trying to make me admit that I saw
you naked so you can charge me for it!

267
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,550
What?! How greedy do you think I am?!

268
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Although I'm still charging.

269
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,850
You are?!

270
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,720
Anyway, I refuse to believe anything I
see on this island! Including you naked!

271
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,180
You just imagined the invisible man!

272
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,100
The ghosts are just weird birds!

273
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,680
The zombies are just a unique tribe:
The Hollow Earth People!

274
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,480
They're what?

275
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,570
Sure, we met a skeleton that had died
and come back because of a Devil Fruit!

276
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,820
We did, but that was truly
the exception to the rule!

277
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,570
Two people can't possess the same power!

278
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,120
And there is no stinkin' way
the dead can come back to life!

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Right, Chopper?

280
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
Don't you agree with me?

281
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,410
Isn't it natural to assume they
were something along those lines?

282
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,280
Well, from a medical perspective,
all of this has been impossible.

283
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,300
I think your logic makes more sense.

284
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,390
But Dr. Hogback has abandoned his
life of glory to delve into his research.

285
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,350
Just maybe, miracles of that scale
have been happening on this island!

286
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,320
Hey, a-are you serious...?

287
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
Aren't you putting a bit
too much faith in that man?

288
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,110
Dr. Hogback is a truly
wonderful man! I respect him!

289
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,280
You're the one being rude!

290
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,040
Don't accuse the doctor of conspiring with
zombies if you can't back up your claim!

291
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,120
Even if I can't, everything is
pointing in that direction!

292
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,170
The doctor is the Zombie King!

293
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,510
Knock it off, you two!
You're freaking me out!

294
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Anyway, let me talk to the doctor.
Is that acceptable, Nami?

295
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,230
I hope Luffy and the guys save us soon...

296
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,110
It's true that I'm only
basing this on my intuition,

297
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,020
but everything about this place is creepy...

298
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,170
Usopp? Chopper?

299
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,460
What is it, Nami?

300
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,260
Isn't that the room we were in earlier?

301
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah... Whoa! Why is it pitch black?!

302
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,010
What?!

303
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,550
C-Cindry-chan...?

304
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,270
Doctor, where did you go?

305
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,730
I enjoyed the bath!

306
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,160
Ex-Excuse me!

307
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,710
D-Doctor!

308
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,430
Those two have already
turned in for the night.

309
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,140
Hildon?!

310
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,680
You jerk! How dare you
abandon us in that graveyard?!

311
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,940
My humblest apologies.

312
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,270
I left to attend some errands with the horses.
The moment I took my eyes off them--

313
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,430
You're a bag of lies!

314
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,300
Everyone on this island
is in cahoots with each other, right?!

315
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,610
P-Please don't make such vile accusations!

316
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,660
Come right this way.
I'll show you to your rooms.

317
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,250
You're at it again, trying to
"show us" somewhere!

318
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,100
I wonder if that's the real
entrance to the underworld.

319
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,300
Thanks for the offer, but we must be off now!

320
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,470
What?! Wait a sec! Let me talk
to the doctor a bit more!

321
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,940
She has spurned you, Hildon.

322
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,140
Wh-Who's there?! I don't see anyone...

323
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,190
Keep out of this! I'll be sure
to take them to their rooms.

324
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,110
Why don't we drop this charade?

325
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,780
They are already starting to grow suspicious.

326
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,870
Before we slip up and give
them a chance to escape...

327
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,830
Wh-Why...

328
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,540
...is the picture...

329
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,000
...t-t-ta...?!

330
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,610
You're trembling. How adorable!

331
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,520
You're so cute...

332
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,560
I won't let you leave, children!

333
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,940
No!

334
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,670
Ch-Chopper!

335
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,150
A zombie popped outta the picture!

336
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,860
Save me!

337
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,030
Chopper!

338
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,320
That's right! You get him, Nami!

339
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,040
Help me out!

340
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,220
You can do it, Nami!

341
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,970
I'm Oinkchuck-sama, the head hog
of the zombies in this room!

342
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,220
You'll be dead before you get so
much as a single foot out the door!

343
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,350
Th-The wall mount... talked!

344
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,640
N-Nami, did you see that?!
The wall mount was talking!

345
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,600
The wall mount--!

346
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,570
Ow, ow, ow...

347
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,030
Who was the jerk that
stabbed me in the back?!

348
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,750
It's just like Nami said!
This mansion is teeming with zombies!

349
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,220
Usopp!

350
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Punk!

351
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,970
Take this, you darn bear rug!

352
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,720
Crap! It's a candle!

353
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,850
It's hot! It's rottin' hot!

354
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,230
Fire! It's terrifying!

355
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,350
Put it out!

356
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,270
Crap! He climbed up the chandelier!

357
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,430
Someone knock him back down!

358
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,900
I know what you're weak against!

359
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,530
I've got enough for everyone! Take this!

360
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,910
Eat this!

361
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,830
Darn you!

362
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,790
And you! And you!

363
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,880
Chopper! Nami! Head for the door!

364
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,050
We're leaving the mansion!

365
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,590
--Yeah!
--I'm leaving! I've had it!

366
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,220
Hurry and open the door! I don't
wanna spend another minute here!

367
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,310
What's keeping you, Nami?!

368
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,510
No!

369
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,850
D-Don't tell me...

370
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,270
It won't open! We're trapped in here!

371
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,690
What?!

372
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,990
Now you've made me mad!

373
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,400
I won't let you escape!

374
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,950
Now come on back!

375
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,670
No!

376
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,760
Chopper, I don't really wanna know,
but what's on that operating table...?

377
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,930
Do you really want to know?

378
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,250
You had to ask? So it's what I think it is?

379
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,340
Are you ready? I'm going to tell you now.

380
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,770
G-G-Give me a sec! I'm not ready for this!

381
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,100
--That's--
--I'm scared!

382
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

383
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,230
"The Zombie's Secret!
Hogback's Nightmarish Laboratory!"

384
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,250
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
