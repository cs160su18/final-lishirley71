2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,250
I've finally found some...

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,220
Some people with such nice memories...

25
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
Oh, good morning.

26
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,240
Is something the matter?

27
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,540
Who are you?

28
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,790
What?

29
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:44,720
"Was It Lost? Stolen? Who Are You?"

30
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,600
I can still eat lots more...

31
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,110
Gimme seconds!

32
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,390
Wh-Where am I?

33
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,020
And who are these people?!

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
--Hey.
--Yes?!

35
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,980
You know anything about this?

36
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,440
--Huh?
--I'm Sanji.

37
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm a cook at the Sea Restaurant Baratie.

38
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,280
I remember going to sleep in
my room yesterday like always,

39
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,660
but then I woke up in this strange
place with you complete strangers.

40
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,080
Do you know why?!

41
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,960
N-N-No...

42
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,590
Huh? What?

43
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,550
You mean you guys didn't save me?

44
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,180
Save?

45
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
I'm Luffy.

46
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,430
I left Fusha Village and went sailing,

47
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,140
but then I ran into this gigantic whirlpool...

48
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,730
I remember getting into a
barrel and getting all dizzy...

49
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,900
...and then I suddenly wound up here.

50
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,860
I figured you guys had saved me.

51
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,110
Wh-What's going on here?

52
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,410
I remember having a silly conversation
with Kaya-chan yesterday,

53
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,040
then playing with Pepper and
the gang before hitting the hay...

54
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,830
But I don't remember a thing after that!

55
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,710
And these guys are the same?!

56
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,380
So, do you know anything?

57
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,290
Huh?

58
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,130
Do you have any idea why we're here?

59
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,800
I don't know what's going on,
much less who these guys are...

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll just have to bluff for now...!

61
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,560
All right. I'll tell you.

62
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,150
It's no surprise you've forgotten
everything up until yesterday.

63
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,650
After all, you were attacked
by a legendary giant whale.

64
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,820
A legendary giant whale?

65
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,580
That's right. I defeated it and saved
you guys after it swallowed you.

66
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,290
Wow! Really?! Thanks!

67
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,580
Just who are you?

68
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,630
I'm glad you asked!

69
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm Usopp, leader of a great pirate crew
that rules the seas of the East Blue!

70
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,630
I have the people's undying praise!

71
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,930
"Captain Usopp" is what they call me!

72
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,310
Wow! Captain Usopp!

73
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,020
--You know him?
--No, not at all!

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,150
Better watch what you say.

75
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,610
The Usopp Pirates have 8,000 members--

76
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,200
What?! 8,000?!

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,870
Incidentally, you're both my
subordinates as of yesterday!

78
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,330
For real?!

79
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,290
You're lying.

80
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,630
--Eep! You could tell?!
--See, you even admit it.

81
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,090
I admitted it! You dirty schemer!

82
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,220
You're a funny guy!

83
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,050
Hey, you! Don't make fun of me!

84
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,760
I'm a proud man!

85
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,980
I have so much pride that people
call me "Usopp the Proud"!

86
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,400
Huh? What's wrong?

87
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,360
Oh, it's just... I feel like I've done this before...

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,410
Me too...

89
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,410
What a pain.

90
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,910
Let's just leave it at that for now.

91
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:49,460
What we need is food. People
can't think on empty stomachs.

92
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,000
Food?!

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,380
Yeah, didn't you say you're a cook?

94
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,590
A first-class cook.

95
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,050
If this is a ship, there's gotta be something.

96
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,180
A cook...

97
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,850
Hey, hold on a sec!

98
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,140
Just who are you, anyway?!

99
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,150
Me? I'm the man who's
gonna be King of the Pirates!

100
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Huh?

101
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,030
Whoa. This ship's been through a lot.

102
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,200
Oh! An island!

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,120
I wonder where we are!

104
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,290
I have bad news, guys. Our navigator is...

105
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,540
Oh? Who the heck are they?

106
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,750
Are they also your subordinates, Captain Usopp?

107
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,010
Hm?! Y-Yeah, of course!

108
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,720
You guys lost your memories, too?

109
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,140
Oh, I finally understand how a foolish
moth feels as it flies into a lamp...

110
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,730
People can't help but leap into
the brilliant radiance of others!

111
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,440
Hi, pretty ladies! Your names, please?

112
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,160
If you're free, what do you
say to dinner tonight?!

113
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,830
Man, this guy's funny!

114
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,830
He suddenly has a different personality...

115
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,710
Uhh, who are these guys?! And where am I?!

116
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,840
Not to mention...

117
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,930
Isn't that... backwards?

118
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,850
--What the heck is that?
--It's a deer.

119
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,650
Shut up, human! I'm a reindeer!

120
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,070
It talked!

121
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,200
Hey! Let's catch it!

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,740
Hey, stop! It's creepy!

123
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,820
Hey, girl! Help me out!

124
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,040
No way! S-Stay away from me!

125
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,040
Oh, boy... Where do I even begin to explain?

126
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,240
All right. Listen, everyone.

127
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,070
We're currently located in...

128
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,500
What did you just say...?

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,880
I said we're in the Grand Line.

130
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,720
Have you forgotten that too?

131
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,260
Seriously?!

132
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,470
Hey! What are you so happy for?!

133
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,020
They say the Grand Line is
teeming with monsters and stuff!

134
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,480
You should be freaked out!

135
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,270
Still, it doesn't seem so
different from the regular sea.

136
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,440
Is this really the Grand Line?

137
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,900
Navigator?

138
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,950
Who, me?!

139
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,160
Do you recognize what's on your arm?

140
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,280
What is this?!

141
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,740
It's a Log Pose.

142
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Compasses don't work here,

143
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,210
so islands' magnetic fields
are used for navigation instead.

144
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,090
That's what that tool is for.

145
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,710
It's essential for crossing the Grand Line.

146
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,050
Tell me, Miss. I need to return
to my restaurant in the East Blue.

147
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,770
How can I go about that?

148
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,640
I wouldn't recommend it.

149
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,440
We've been traveling a long time;
heading back alone would be suicide.

150
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,400
We've continually followed
the Log Pose's directions.

151
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,700
And that's led us to this coral-surrounded isle.

152
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,450
This is all too much at once for me to believe!

153
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,420
Why would I be cheerfully
traveling with people like this?!

154
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,170
That's why.

155
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,340
Oh, man! That's a pirate flag!

156
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,220
What?! It's a pirate ship?!

157
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Th-That's right! It's the great
Captain Usopp's pirate ship!

158
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,180
For real?!

159
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,060
Actually, Captain Usopp...

160
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,150
Is it me, or is that skull wearing a straw hat?

161
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,860
Oh!

162
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,610
That just means... this hat is mine!

163
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,820
What are you doing?! Give it back!

164
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,450
Don't touch my straw hat! I'll kick
your butt if you do that again!

165
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,370
What? I thought you lost your memory?!

166
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,790
I remember this! It's my treasure!

167
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,710
Treasure...?

168
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,300
It's a precious treasure a friend
gave me when I was little!

169
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,010
I swore on this hat I'd become
a pirate and gather a crew!

170
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,980
Pirates this, pirates that! What a stupid era!

171
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,940
But at least now I know that
everything you've said is nonsense!

172
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,410
I hate pirates! What I like
are money and tangerines!

173
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,740
There's no way that I'd
be traveling with pirates!

174
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Hey, now. Might wanna watch your tone, girl...

175
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,250
Tangerines? Like those?

176
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,920
Huh?

177
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,390
Those tangerine trees...!

178
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,020
What was that?!

179
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,440
Whoa...! It just grew an arm!

180
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,730
Mystery tangerines?!

181
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,480
Just who are you?!

182
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,360
More important is that tangerine...

183
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,410
This is one of Bellemere-san's tangerines!
I know that much for sure!

184
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,290
What are her tangerines doing on this ship?!

185
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,330
Unfortunately, I don't know
much about that myself.

186
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,420
Why don't you check the
ship's logbook in your room?

187
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,750
Huh?

188
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,170
As I recall, there's a picture
of your Bellemere-san in it.

189
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,490
It's my handwriting...

190
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,500
Bellemere-san...

191
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,680
Bellemere-san!

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Look at how many I got!

193
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,720
Some of them are still green!

194
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,480
You know better, Nami!
You have to pay attention!

195
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,230
What? But they were nice and sweet!

196
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,230
You ate some?! They're
merchandise, you know!

197
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,690
It's all right. We can eat these ones ourselves.

198
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,780
Okay! You're a big meanie, Nojiko!

199
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,200
What?!

200
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,700
All right, get to work, you two!

201
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,790
I have to go back...

202
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,300
Something might've happened
to Cocoyashi Village...

203
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,640
So... what exactly is it?

204
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,480
Neato reindeer!

205
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,900
Reindeer!

206
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,400
You idiot! Stay away!

207
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,740
Reindeer...

208
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,070
It's great when thinly sliced,
slowly simmered with vegetables,

209
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,080
and made into a stew...

210
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,500
What?! We can eat it?!

211
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,920
Reindeer steak with berry sauce is also superb.

212
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Steak, it is!

213
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,790
Why, you...!

214
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,050
I ain't no food!

215
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,810
Don't eat him. He's the ship's doctor.

216
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,600
Doctor?

217
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,690
Yes. He's a brilliant doctor
beyond even human compare.

218
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,820
Isn't that right?

219
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,030
Sh-Shut up!

220
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,200
Being praised by humans doesn't
make me happy at all, you jerk!

221
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,450
Oh, you sure seem happy to me!

222
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,620
He's a reindeer who ate the Human Human
Fruit and gained human abilities.

223
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,460
Incidentally, I ate the Flower Flower Fruit
and gained Devil Fruit powers.

224
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,960
And Luffy has eaten a Devil Fruit as well, right?

225
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah! I ate the Gum Gum Fruit!

226
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,930
I'm made of rubber!

227
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,180
Th-Three people with Devil Fruit powers...?!

228
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,640
This ain't normal...

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,440
Are you guys pirates?! Real pirates?!

230
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,230
That's right. You are too, you know.

231
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,820
All right! As of today, you're a
member of the Usopp Pirates too!

232
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,860
What?! How come?!

233
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,320
You're taking him seriously?

234
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,030
In any case, along with one other person,

235
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,080
we've been crossing these seas
as a seven-member pirate crew.

236
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,540
One other person?

237
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,380
Why don't you come down, Swordsman?

238
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,130
You guys're making quite a
racket so early in the morning.

239
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,430
You're interrupting my morning nap.

240
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,180
Wh-Who are you?! State your name!

241
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,600
You're supposed to give your name
first when asking someone's name.

242
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,890
--Oh...
--I'm Luffy! Nice to meet you!

243
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,690
I'm Roronoa Zoro.

244
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,730
As in "Pirate Hunter"?

245
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,740
I've never once gone by that name.
I just wound up with it.

246
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,910
You're still a bounty hunter, though.

247
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,000
I only did it when I needed money to survive.

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,910
It ain't my goal.

249
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,590
But I take it you're only here 'cause
you were targeting a pirate ship?

250
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,130
Beats me. I got no idea why I'm here.

251
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,220
Are you guys notorious pirates?

252
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,390
You're out to get us after all!

253
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,890
F-Fine, bring it on! I have 8,000
people under my command!

254
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,650
Oh? Then I bet you're worth a lot.

255
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,570
I needed some food money anyway.
I'll be more than happy to take you on!

256
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,240
N-No! That's not what I meant! C-C-Calm down!

257
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,870
Say something, will you?!

258
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,700
He doesn't have a bounty.
Not even a single Berry.

259
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,910
Nothing at all?!

260
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,930
I have to get out of here somehow.

261
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,220
Gold!

262
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,850
This is enough to buy Cocoyashi Village
back and have money left over!

263
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,090
Now how do I haul it out...?

264
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,800
What is that?

265
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,940
What's that?!

266
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,500
Amazing! It can run on the water too!

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,960
Huh? She left!

268
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,170
That thing's so neat!

269
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,340
Miss...

270
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,970
I've got no idea what's going on,

271
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,050
but it seems like there's
no point in me staying here.

272
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,230
Huh? He left too. What's the deal?

273
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,580
What the heck's going on around here...?

274
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,540
I haven't the slightest, either.

275
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,210
This is a real conundrum...

276
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

277
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

278
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

279
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

280
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

281
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

282
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

283
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,050
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

284
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

285
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

286
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

287
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

288
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

289
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,070
To this familiar sunny sky

290
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

291
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

292
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,200
Eternally... Eternally...

293
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,170
This is crazy! I'd never team up with pirates!

294
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,430
But this is my handwriting in the logbook...

295
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,430
Oh, and the treasure's mine too!

296
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,270
Wait! Whoa! What kind of scene is this?!

297
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,230
Ahh! Hey! Was it you?!
Give our memories back!

298
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

299
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,480
"A Mysterious Boy with a Horn
and Robin's Deduction!"

300
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,030
You're never gonna be King of the Pirates!!
