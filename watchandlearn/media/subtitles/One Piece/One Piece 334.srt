2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,610
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,150
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,900
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,490
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,510
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,060
Here's the thing about phoenixes:

48
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,430
No matter the hardship,
they always rise back up!

49
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,100
And they're reborn even stronger than before!

50
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,940
I...

51
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,490
Sorry, men! I was a foolish
captain who couldn't live up

52
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,240
to the trust my precious friend placed in me.

53
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,000
But... But I wanna let...

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,330
...Vigaro see it once more!

55
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,000
He has to see our flag flying
above the ocean where he's at rest!

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,010
Hey! Give back my flag!

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,140
It looks like Luffy is here.

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,350
He's come for our Jolly Roger.

59
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,640
That's right! We're finished!

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,480
No! We can still make it!

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,020
Indeed. I don't know how
Luffy learned about the flag,

62
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,480
but it's not as though he
witnessed it getting stolen.

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,900
Yep! Which means we've still got a chance!

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,570
I know where the Jolly Roger is.

65
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,160
You can leave it to me.

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Sweet!

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,580
Way to go, Robin!

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,290
You're far more reliable
than that lame moss head.

69
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,800
Promise to become my big sister.

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,340
Do and I'll save you.

71
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,520
You've made a fool of the Accino Family!

72
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,940
So you're the one who stole
our Jolly Roger, Naked Balloon!

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,650
Hmph! So what if I did, whippersnapper?

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm gonna kick your butt right
quick and get our flag back!

75
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:18,170
"The Super Hot-Hot Final Battle!
Luffy vs. the Scorching Hot Don"

76
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,590
Wow! So you're a Devil
Fruit power holder, huh?

77
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,640
It truly has been a long time
since I personally hunted a pirate.

78
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,060
You should be honored, Straw Hat!

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,270
Don Accino...

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,610
So he's the head of that
family of bounty hunters, huh?

81
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,980
What type of powers did he
get from the Hot-Hot Fruit...?

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,910
It's his fault that the temperature
has been going up and down!

83
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,950
You're going to kick my butt?

84
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:57,080
Thinking back, I've met countless
pirates who've made that same claim.

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,870
Do you know what happened to them?

86
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,580
--Each and every one...
--Gum-Gum...

87
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,210
You should let me finish talking!

88
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,380
...Pistol!

89
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,260
Hot! Hot!

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,680
I can melt... anything I touch.

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,610
Wha--?!

92
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,030
Still think you can win?

93
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,780
Gum-Gum...

94
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,200
...Battle Axe!

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,660
It burns!

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,460
Luffy's attacks aren't working!

97
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,960
He hasn't even touched the guy!

98
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,460
Bastard!

99
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,880
Gum-Gum Gatling!

100
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,220
You still don't get it, do you?

101
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,060
--He's hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
--Luffy!

102
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,310
You can't lay so much as a finger on me.

103
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,020
Damn it!

104
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,440
He's too hot to punch!

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,110
Lookie! Slip, slip, slip away!

106
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,240
Wh-What?!

107
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,160
I can even do stuff like this!

108
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,250
My entire body is suspended
by the tiny bit of steam

109
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,920
emitted from the ice melted
by the soles of my feet.

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,010
Awesome! That's so neat!

111
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,140
What's he doing?

112
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Yay!

113
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,600
Slippity-slip!

114
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,610
Slip around like fools!

115
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,900
Check it out!

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,360
Heh heh!

117
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,490
--Wahoo!
--Screech!

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,960
Your Hot-Hot ability isn't all that bad after all!

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,790
Just what I should have expected
from a 300-million Berry bounty.

120
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,550
You're pretty good!

121
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,510
Good at what?!

122
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,510
But...

123
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,470
...the real fight has just begun!

124
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,430
Wh-What's that?

125
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,970
Hot Makeup!

126
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,020
What the--?!

127
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,690
I can't see a thing! What's he up to?

128
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,810
Hot-Fried Tofu!

129
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,070
Our flags are somewhere inside that house...!

130
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,070
Jiro, let's go!

131
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,700
Huh? But...

132
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,410
Luffy'll be fine!

133
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:39,950
All right!

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,410
Wait!

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,750
Uh...

136
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,710
I love children.

137
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,380
However...

138
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,880
...I only love my children!

139
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,970
That burns!

140
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,050
Chopper!

141
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,270
Hey, Naked Balloon!

142
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,520
Don't throw a hissy fit. I'll play with you now.

143
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,980
Huh?

144
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,480
Ready for the finishing move?

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,530
Steam...

146
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,700
...Iron!

147
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,450
L-Luffy!

148
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,040
Damn it! We can't afford to let
Papa's temper grow any hotter!

149
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,460
Papa is going to claim
Straw Hat's head, anyway.

150
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,960
At the very least, I need to
take out this 100-Berry-bounty,

151
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,170
so I can lift his spirits
back up as much as possible!

152
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,510
Sorry, but I can't hand my head
over to a lowly bounty hunter!

153
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,570
Puzzle, you may think you're
fighting on par with me,

154
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,410
but the tables are about to turn.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm frozen to the bone!

156
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,290
Cold!

157
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,380
Men, is this the best the
Phoenix Pirates can do?

158
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,970
I can't help it!

159
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,430
Now then, it's about time I took your head.

160
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,150
That hurt, dammit!

161
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,650
Y-You didn't take any damage?

162
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,820
I was burning hot at first, but luckily
the ice cooled me right off!

163
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,330
Is that right? This time I'll melt
your entire body in a flash...

164
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,040
...so I don't have to endure any
more of your insolent garbage!

165
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,000
Heat Level Up: 3,000 Degrees!

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,300
That's an impressive amount of smoke!

167
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,460
This isn't smoke!

168
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,420
I just can't touch you, right?

169
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,400
Gum-Gum...

170
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
...Bazooka!

171
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,410
Yay! He went flying!

172
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,030
Amazing!

173
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,490
Luffy!

174
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,500
We don't have time to be rejoicing!

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,040
At this rate, Luffy will go after
the Jolly Roger in no time!

176
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,260
Crap! Crap! He'll find out that
they stole our flag for real!

177
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,760
What's holding Robin up?

178
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,970
Curse you, Straw Hat!

179
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,610
As soon as you lose the ability to manipulate
that vexing chain, you're finished!

180
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,030
These penguins plan on freezing us.

181
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,910
Then they'll come in for
the kill once we can't move.

182
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,250
--Damn it!
--The beasts!

183
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,210
Men, fall into a close formation
so we can share body heat!

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,220
Th-This is so wrong!

185
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm working up a nasty sweat!

186
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,890
Moron! It's not like I want to do this!

187
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,980
Men, do you feel nice and warm?

188
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,940
I'd rather fight than keep this up!

189
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm with him, Commander Stansen!

190
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,440
That's the spirit! Let's go!

191
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,910
Puzzle, prepare to die!

192
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,950
You're the one going down!

193
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,250
Where is our flag?!

194
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,380
Let's go!

195
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,010
Yeah!

196
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:18,190
You're the first man to ever bring me
to my hands and knees, Straw Hat.

197
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeah? You've still got some fight left in you?

198
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,280
And you're also the first
to have truly made me mad!

199
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,910
Heat Level Up: 5,500 Degrees!

200
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,240
Hot Omelet Shots!

201
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,540
Don Accino...!

202
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,870
Straw Hat!

203
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,580
Robin-chan still hasn't given the sign,

204
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,590
which means we're stuck
reclaiming the flag ourselves!

205
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,800
Sure does! We've gotta beat Luffy to it!

206
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,470
I'll keep an eye on Luffy.

207
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,680
That's it for our strategy meeting!

208
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,180
We're all set!

209
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,050
Are you okay, Jiro?

210
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,720
Captain!

211
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,140
Sorry for making you worry about me.

212
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,890
I wasn't worried any!

213
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,110
That aside, we've gotta get our flag back!

214
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,570
Yeah! We're going to reclaim our--
the Phoenix Pirates'--pride!

215
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,570
--Uh-huh!
--Let's go!

216
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,160
Captain, it's horrible! Our ship pulled
away from the shore all on its own!

217
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,910
What?!

218
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,960
Please leave the ship to us!
Captain, you go with Jiro!

219
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,710
I'm counting on you, Stansen!

220
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,960
Let's go, Jiro!

221
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,460
Uh-huh!

222
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,520
You're one slippery brat!

223
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,810
But you're done for, Straw Hat!

224
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,730
Take this! Hot-Hot Gatling!

225
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,690
What?! That's my move!

226
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,690
No way!

227
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,610
H-He's fast!

228
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,660
But your shots are moving
at the same speed as earlier!

229
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,080
S-Stupid! Hurry and run for it, Luffy!

230
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,670
Luffy!

231
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,130
That startled me!

232
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,970
I don't care about your bounty anymore.

233
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm going to melt you into nothing but steam!

234
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,060
Doesn't 300-million-Berry
steam sound luxurious?

235
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,680
Well, Straw Hat?

236
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,020
I'm not a sauna, Naked Balloon!

237
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Evaporate off the face of the planet, Straw Hat!

238
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,210
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

239
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,010
That burns!

240
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,260
It's all your fault.

241
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,930
Because of you, my darling
daughter and sons were...!

242
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,390
I'll never forgive you!

243
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,230
The temperature keeps climbing up!

244
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,490
Is his Hot-Hot Fruit to blame?

245
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,280
There might be more to it than that...

246
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,020
Huh? Sanji, Franky's missing!

247
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,690
Where the heck did he go?

248
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,820
Don't worry about him!
I'm sure he has plans of his own.

249
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,570
What?!

250
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,900
This must be the Savage Penguins' doing!

251
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,160
Dammit! They trashed our raiding dory,
so we can't go after them!

252
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,580
Are they retaliating for how
we took out their friends?

253
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,410
Just how messed up are these penguins?!

254
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,790
The captain and Jiro will
definitely get our Jolly Roger!

255
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,800
I couldn't bear to face them if they came back

256
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,430
and there wasn't a ship
on which to hoist the flag!

257
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,270
Commander Stansen!

258
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,900
Please, Big Sister Robin!

259
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,570
Stay here with me forever!

260
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,620
Promise that you won't go anywhere.

261
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,580
I can't do that, Lil.

262
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,790
Why not?

263
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,040
--Robin-chan!
--Robin!

264
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Why won't you do as I say?

265
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,760
Is that kid controlling the plant?

266
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,670
In that case, I'll give her a good spanking!

267
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,590
You are strictly prohibited from
raising your hand against a lady.

268
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,140
You have a broad definition of the term...

269
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,640
Unhand Robin-chan, you stinking flower!

270
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,980
Here I come!

271
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,400
Why, you--! Take this!

272
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,860
Are your friends all that important to you?

273
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,820
Yes. I want to get our flag back.

274
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
The Straw Hat Crew's flag?

275
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,830
Papa enjoys collecting a bunch of Jolly Rogers,

276
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,790
but I don't care about those scraps of cloth...

277
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,710
Indeed, they may be nothing
more than scraps of cloth.

278
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,760
But to us pirates, our flag is
more important than life itself.

279
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,140
It's something we can't lose, no matter what!

280
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,190
Are they really all that important...?

281
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,150
Oh, no! Papa...!

282
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,860
He's really angry!

283
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,120
S-S-Save--!

284
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm only saying this for your own good!
You'll get indigestion if you eat him!

285
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,210
--Lil!
--Special Attack! Exploding Star!

286
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,260
Lil!

287
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,730
You're okay now.

288
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,190
Big Sister Robin...!

289
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,610
If anything were to happen to you,
your big sister and brothers would be sad.

290
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,740
You're their cute, precious little sister!

291
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,650
Isn't that right?

292
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,490
You aren't alone.

293
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,330
Hold your family dear!

294
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,760
Are we on top of a...?

295
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,090
Second... Gear!

296
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,310
You're going to the New World?

297
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,270
Yeah. After I get our Jolly Roger back.

298
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,440
You'll never get there. Your destination
was set in stone a long time ago!

299
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,740
I've already decided that's where I'm headed.

300
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,280
I'm definitely going there after I kick your butt!

301
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,240
Gum-Gum...

302
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,620
...Jet Pistol!

303
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,430
Found it!

304
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,570
Hot!

305
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,570
Zoro!

306
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,450
Zoro...!

307
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,790
I won't let go, even if it kills me!

308
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,420
This is our pride as pirates!

309
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,500
Jiro!

310
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,350
C-Captain... I...

311
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,930
You did great, Jiro!

312
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,360
Surprisingly Hot Nose Jet!

313
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,490
Chopper!

314
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,870
Guys! I... I made sure to get it! Look!

315
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,670
So we made it in time.

316
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,460
We did it, Nami-san! Now Luffy
won't make fun of--whoa, wait!

317
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,920
Whoa! What's with that flag?!

318
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,430
What the heck?!

319
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,810
Why'd it turn out like this?

320
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,270
It looks like we get to start over from scratch...

321
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,200
Didn't Robin, Sanji-kun,
and the others make it in time?

322
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,820
I hope ours isn't amongst those...!

323
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,930
My beloved family...

324
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,890
My Lovely Land...

325
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,850
And now my prized collection!

326
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,560
I swear, I will personally take you out!

327
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,270
Hot-Hot powers, to the max!

328
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,610
Maximum Heat Level: 10,000 Degrees!

329
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,910
You can still heat up?

330
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,300
What the heck are those two up to?!
The ice is melting right and left!

331
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,220
It looks like they're going all out.

332
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,510
But I'm starting to get
concerned about our Log Pose.

333
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:40,100
They're unbelievable! I guess I'll go
pick them up in my super ship right quick!

334
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,440
On the next episode of One Piece!

335
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,650
"We'll Be Waiting in the New World!
Parting with the Courageous Pirates"

336
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
