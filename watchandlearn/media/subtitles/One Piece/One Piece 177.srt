2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,410
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,040
The survival battle in
God's Land, Upper Yard, continues.

19
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,090
Priest Ohm, who serves God Eneru.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,220
Wyper, a Shandian warrior.

21
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,680
Gan Fall, the Sky Knight.

22
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,890
And Zoro.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,030
Their fierce battle for survival has started.

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,420
Ahhhh... That idiot...!

25
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,170
Aisa!

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,460
You're idiots who can't
even protect yourselves.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Quit worrying about others!

28
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,040
At any rate, no one will survive!

29
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,430
"The Ordeal of Iron!
White Barbed Death Match!!"

30
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,400
That's our Ohm-sama!

31
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,410
The survivors in the Upper Ruins
are four Divine Soldiers.

32
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,100
Since those two are probably still alive,

33
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,810
that makes four Shandians
and one Blue Sea person.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
One giant snake and Holy...

35
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,200
In other words, ten people and two animals.

36
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,730
It'll be five survivors soon,
just like God prophesied.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Now, let's continue the battle, shall we?

38
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,320
I'll finish you off.

39
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,640
Ohm! You bastard!

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,560
How dare you harm Wyper?!

41
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,810
Oh? Even when this man is
but a speck in God's eyes,

42
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,280
he is that important to you?

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,780
Wyper is our leader!!

44
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,660
We've shared the Shandians' pride!

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,830
In order to take back our
homeland that was taken away!

46
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,270
Eneru's servant can't
understand the Shandians' bond!

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,640
Well, even if I understood it,
I wouldn't feel sympathy or empathy.

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,060
In other words...

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,630
...it's all for naught!

50
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,010
Die, Ohm!

51
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,820
Are you running away?!

52
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,650
It's the climax. Holy, it's time for that!

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,840
Dash, Holy!

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,600
What's he doing now?!

55
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,040
Dammit! What's that dog
doing?! This is trouble!

56
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,890
This surely is... the
Iron Ordeal's true form!

57
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,000
The white barbed death match!

58
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,630
Fence or no fence, I'm not running away.

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,310
You fool! It's not just so
you can't run away anymore!

60
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,160
You're surrounded by the white barbs!

61
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,030
So what?!

62
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,350
In other words...

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,200
...once you touch it, you'll get hurt!

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,860
So where do I get out when
I'm done with you all?!

65
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,330
You can think about that when you're done.

66
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,200
Eight more people and two animals left!

67
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,020
I'd better do something
about that giant snake first.

68
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,580
Nami's in it... and...

69
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,610
Sky Knight!!

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,090
...so's the guy who saved Chopper.

71
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,790
Wyper...

72
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,710
When we were small, you told me...

73
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,810
Our ancestors originally
lived in the Blue Sea...

74
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,220
...in the sacred city, Shandora.

75
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,350
The Great Warrior Calgara
protected our homeland.

76
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,380
But 400 years ago...

77
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,610
...Shandora was shot up to
Skypiea by the Knock-Up Stream.

78
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,170
They could never go back to the Blue Sea.

79
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,030
It must've been very tough for them.

80
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,330
But Skypieans took over the land,
calling it "sacred ground"!

81
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,040
Our ancestors were driven
out of their homeland.

82
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,900
We can't go back to our sacred city.

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,990
We aren't even allowed to touch
the ground of our homeland!

84
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,830
For 400 long years, we, Shandians,
have suffered humiliation!

85
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,770
That Upper Yard belongs to us!

86
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,110
We will take back... our homeland...

87
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,620
...as well as our ancestors' pride!

88
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,190
Once we defeat Eneru, we won't need
to revere a single bag of Vearth.

89
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,440
We're going back. To the 400-year-old
homeland of the Shandians!

90
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,810
Those who aren't prepared,
stay here. I won't blame you.

91
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,440
C'mon, Wyper! We're always prepared!

92
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,730
Are you prepared to abandon
anyone who falls during the fight?

93
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Those who can step over comrades
and keep moving, come with me!

94
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,040
Today... Eneru's head will be mine!

95
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,500
Wyper!

96
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,280
Wyper!!

97
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm glad I found you!

98
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,450
Laki!

99
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,540
Wyper! Listen to me!

100
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,170
Why did you come here?!

101
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,380
I came here to give you Kamakiri's message!

102
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,630
No one can... defeat him...

103
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,890
Get out of here, Wyper! Don't fight!

104
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,540
Eneru is in the forest!

105
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,610
Hey, Laki!

106
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,830
Eneru is lightning itself, which people
have feared as God since long ago.

107
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,370
Don't come near here! Get out of here!

108
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
There's no way we can defeat him!

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
Hey, stop it!

110
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,750
Wyper...?

111
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,710
You called me?

112
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,230
Eneru...

113
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,700
Stop it, Eneru! Don't!

114
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,050
She abandoned the battle!

115
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,570
Hey!!

116
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,960
Laki!!

117
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,370
Laki! Don't fight him!

118
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,320
Laki!

119
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,080
Run!!

120
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,400
You fool! Don't think you can survive
while you're worrying about others!

121
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,170
He's... invincible...!

122
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,320
He's lightning... which people have
feared as God... since long ago...

123
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,910
I got you, Wyper!

124
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,430
You fool!

125
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,690
Get out of here!

126
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,390
Eneru!!

127
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,540
Oh? It didn't work on him?

128
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,820
Then, I'll give you another shot!

129
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,730
You're softer than I thought.

130
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,020
Wyper, Shandian warrior!

131
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,460
Even if she's a woman, she's still a warrior.

132
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,340
I treat all those that challenge me equally.

133
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,070
Well, try your best not to die.

134
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,810
That's... God?!

135
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,810
Man, what a foolish woman,

136
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,110
insolently attacking God.

137
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,830
She received divine punishment.

138
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,190
Before I get out of here, I have
to take care of something.

139
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,910
You giant snake!

140
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,370
I have business with your stomach!

141
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,700
Don't stand in my way!

142
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,180
Holy! Shake hands!

143
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,590
Eisen Whip!

144
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,790
Axe!

145
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,290
Six people and two animals left!

146
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,990
Ow, ow...

147
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,570
Good. Looks like she wasn't seriously hurt.

148
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,010
Where on earth...?

149
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,460
We're in the snake's stomach.

150
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,420
We were swallowed!

151
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,940
Oh, that's right. It seems
to be quite a long stomach.

152
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,680
Hey, Aisa, are you all right?

153
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,860
W-Wyper, I'm sorry!

154
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,040
Huh?

155
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,630
What is this place?

156
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,610
Inside the snake's stomach.

157
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,840
Pay more attention! You're so slow.

158
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,430
Snake's...?!

159
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,040
Now, let's get out of here
before its stomach melts us.

160
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,340
I wonder if the waver still works.

161
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,800
In any case, why aren't you on the ship?

162
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,510
We were chased and had no choice but to run.

163
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,070
Well, more importantly,
isn't that girl Shandian?

164
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,370
Wha...?! God!

165
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,420
I'll eliminate you!

166
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,570
Hey! Stop it!

167
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,500
Anyway, can't we break
through this stomach wall?

168
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,690
Are you nuts?! What're we gonna do
if irritating it makes it go wild?!

169
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,130
Do you wanna die?! Try to use your head more!

170
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,640
O-Oh, that was a joke.

171
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,860
Are you crazy?!
You're really weird, weird knight!

172
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,950
Geez...

173
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,960
If there's someone who'd
seriously try to irritate this snake,

174
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,190
I'd like to meet 'em.

175
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,410
This sound...

176
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,490
It's footsteps.

177
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,460
What could be in a place like this?

178
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,970
Who is it?!

179
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,660
Nami! Weird old man!

180
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,700
You...

181
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,400
Luffy!

182
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,370
What're you doing?!
In a mystery cave like this?!

183
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,080
What are you doing in a place like this?!

184
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,630
I couldn't get out of this place.

185
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,420
I can't believe it!

186
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,360
To think that you were
swallowed by the snake too...

187
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,290
So the others are okay, right?!

188
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,980
Huh? I'm by myself.

189
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,800
What?! Snake?!

190
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,770
That's right. That's why we're here!

191
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,360
Oh, I see... That must've been terrible.

192
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,740
So, you guys were eaten by a snake, huh?

193
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,700
Like I said...

194
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,270
...so were you! We're inside
the snake's stomach!

195
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't pull my nose!

196
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,760
That was my Usopp impression!

197
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,620
Who is this idiot?

198
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,090
I'd rather not say this,
but he's the captain of our ship.

199
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,210
Oh, you are the captain?
It's the end of the world.

200
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,080
Yeah, I guess that's how
people'd normally see it.

201
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,490
You must be really slow, not even
noticing that you were eaten.

202
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,160
Ahhh! Then this place is inside
that giant snake's stomach?!

203
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,340
W-Was I eaten, too?!

204
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,350
That's what I've been telling you.
Your clothes have melted too, you know!

205
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,800
Whoa! You're right!

206
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,580
Hey, then let's look for
its butthole right away!

207
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,470
Butthole?

208
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,030
Just where're you planning to escape from?!

209
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,210
We were eaten, so why not just
go "plop, plop" out of its butt?

210
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,000
No!! I'd rather melt!

211
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,670
Nami's scary.

212
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,640
A Blue Sea woman is brutal.

213
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,270
In any case, we were eaten because
this snake is in a bad mood.

214
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,640
Before it starts going wild again,
we'd better hurry up and...

215
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,070
In a bad mood?

216
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,120
That's right. It seemed like
it was in a very bad mood.

217
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,710
It was going wild all this time.

218
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,360
Why is it in such a bad mood?

219
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,230
Don't tell me...!!

220
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,290
Were you causing a ruckus
in here all this time?

221
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,450
Yeah, I thought I'd break
the wall to get out.

222
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,260
Er... So this was your doing.

223
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,200
Since I went a little wild, I got hungry.

224
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,220
Do you have something to eat?

225
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,260
Wh-What's the matter?

226
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,330
You... stupid idiot!!

227
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,850
Ha!

228
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,410
Groaning like a fool!
That's just what I want!

229
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,400
Don't let its stomach acid melt you, Aisa!

230
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,760
I'll tear open its stomach now!

231
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,500
You son of a...!

232
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,210
Hang in there somehow, Nami...

233
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,520
...and... er... weird knight!

234
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,410
Until I beat this guy!

235
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,770
Now... it's time for the finale at last!

236
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,810
Racing full speed ahead as always

237
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,560
A to Z, we run through it

238
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,360
We all have worries and fall many times

239
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
But we just need to rise to the top someday

240
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,750
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

241
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

242
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,310
I never treat you "bad"

243
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,010
How many times did we fall?

244
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:55,100
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

245
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Smile! Come back to you, friends

246
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

247
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,370
Come back to you, friends

248
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

249
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,910
Come back to you, friends

250
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,260
Okay! Let's hurry up and
get out from the butthole!

251
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,070
Like I said, I don't want to, you idiot!

252
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,830
Let's plop out!

253
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,160
What're you doing?!

254
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,950
How sad, swordsman from the Blue Sea.

255
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,660
No one can survive anymore.

256
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,260
Pray to God with all your heart.

257
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,180
Fine, you creep! But I'll never pray to God!

258
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,210
And I'll bring you down!

259
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,770
On the next episode of One Piece!

260
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,470
"Bursting Slash! Zoro vs. Ohm!!"

261
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
