2
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

8
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,720
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,680
The Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

12
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,690
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

13
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,600
and were drawn into a climactic
battle on Punk Hazard

14
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,450
which ended with Caesar's capture.

15
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,810
Then, they headed out
for their next destination - Dressrosa

16
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,820
along with their pirate
ally - the Warlord - Law.

17
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,740
In the course of their
trip, they were attacked by

18
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,930
the Breed Pirates who were
looking to get hold of Caesar

19
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,090
but they defeated them
after a great struggle.

20
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,420
"Don Quixote Doflamingo..."

21
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,680
"...Withdraws from..."

22
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,020
"...the Seven Warlords"!

23
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,090
"Startling!
The Big News Shakes Up the New World!"

24
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,980
"Withdraws from the Seven Warlords"?
What's going on?

25
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,110
How do I know? Don't ask me!

26
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,000
Dressrosa is finished!

27
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,280
All tall waves were originally...

28
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,390
...little waves, barely worthy of notice.

29
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,800
Hey! What's gonna happen to the arms deal

30
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,830
between Don Quixote family and us?!

31
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,030
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

32
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,990
I've been trying to reach them
but nobody picks up!

33
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,970
What should we do?!

34
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,590
I-I can't believe this!
We will lose the war without arms!

35
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,950
Hey, listen to this!

36
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,110
Those reckless rookies from two years ago
formed an alliance!

37
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm sure they're up to something!

38
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,330
Doflamingo resigned from the Warlords!

39
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,760
Why did he do that?!
Isn't there anymore information?!

40
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,670
Alright! Get more information!

41
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,140
How did they find out about our alliance?!

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,410
Who is this freelance writer named Absa?!

43
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,780
He gets scoops very often these days!

44
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,620
I don't care about us.
I'm more concerned about the other news.

45
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,380
Straw Hat and Trafalgar!

46
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,740
I'm sure they're looking to take out
one of the Four Emperors like we are.

47
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,140
Which one is their target?!

48
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,510
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

49
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,590
Ring, ring, ring...

50
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,270
Ring, ring... Clank.

51
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,470
It's me.
I resigned from the Warlords.

52
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,450
--He picked up!
--Picked up!

53
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,810
Finally!

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,550
Doflamingo?!

55
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,780
He will hear you!

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,760
Hello? I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

58
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,990
I told you to shut up!

59
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,160
Hey, Mingo!

60
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,140
Are you stupid, old Caesar's boss?!

61
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,430
He gave Brownbeard and the children hell!

62
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,650
We will give you back Caesar as we promised
but if you do that again,

63
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,970
I will beat the hell out of you!

64
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,490
Straw Hat Luffy.

65
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,980
You went away for two years
after your brother died.

66
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,420
Where were you
and what were you doing?

67
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,820
I shouldn't tell anyone about it!

68
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,490
I wanted to see you.

69
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,790
What?

70
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,730
I have something
that you'll want very badly now.

71
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,400
Something... that I'll want...

72
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,470
…very badly?

73
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,060
H-Hey!

74
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,620
How delicious is that meat
you're talking about?!

75
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,420
Straw Hat-ya!
Don't get drawn into his pace!

76
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,610
One chunk of meat! Two chunks of meat!

77
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,810
Luffy!

78
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,360
Keep yourself together!

79
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
This is a special attack called "His Pace"!

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,990
One hundred chunks of meat!
Two hundred chunks of meat!

81
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,640
Stop! Don't get drawn into it!

82
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,620
Joker! Cut the crap!

83
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,780
We'll hand Caesar over to you as we promised.

84
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,840
Well, that's for your own good.

85
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,990
If you try to run away with him,

86
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,450
you know what will happen to you guys.

87
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,460
Now, can I hear my precious
business partner's voice?

88
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,980
Joker! I'm sorry!

89
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,490
You resigned from the Warlords for me!

90
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,140
Did you hear him?

91
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
Yeah, he sounded fine.

92
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,260
Eight hours from now,

93
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,310
at the beach on the southeast
side of Green Bit,

94
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,410
the solitary island north of Dressrosa.

95
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,180
We will leave Caesar there
at three in the afternoon.

96
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
Go ahead and pick him up.
And this will all be finished.

97
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,780
That's too bad.
I wish I could have a drink with you...

98
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,100
Just hang up!

99
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,120
Clank.

100
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,020
That was close.

101
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,400
You almost got drawn into his pace.

102
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,970
Your eyes! Your eyes!

103
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,370
Hey, wait!

104
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,280
We didn't tell him how many men he can bring!

105
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,580
"How many men"?

106
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,350
That's right.

107
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,850
What are we gonna do
if he brings his entire crew?!

108
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,250
Damn!

109
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,490
It doesn't matter.

110
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,330
The handover of Caesar is a part of our plan.

111
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,760
It's just to lure them.

112
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,390
You mean, destroying a
SMILE manufacturing factory

113
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,680
while it's unguarded is our main purpose?!

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,470
Yes. But we don't know where it is.

115
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,810
You're joking.

116
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,130
Don't worry!

117
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,080
Factories are big. You can barely miss them.

118
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,920
Once we get there, we'll super find it!

119
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,120
I will destroy it with my laser beam!

120
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,760
Oh, brother!

121
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,530
I have intelligence on
everything but the factory.

122
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,270
No wonder.

123
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,170
It's an important asset for them, isn't it?

124
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,640
Maybe, there is a secret to it.

125
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,900
Law-dono!

126
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,460
Law-dono!

127
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,260
You said you're gonna
go to Green Bit earlier!

128
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,910
Earlier!

129
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
We will dock this ship at Dressrosa.
Don't worry.

130
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,700
Is that so? Thank you!

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,850
Thank you!

132
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,520
Tra-guy, have you been to that island?

133
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,860
Dress-roba!

134
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,860
Dress-roba (old woman)?

135
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,790
It's "rosa"!

136
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,490
I've never been there.

137
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,210
It's that bastard's kingdom.

138
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,730
Then, let's figure everything out
once we get there!

139
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,390
It's gonna be an adventure!

140
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,610
Can't wait to see Dressrosa!

141
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,850
I wanna go to the Wano Kingdom soon, too!

142
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,290
Don't be ridiculous!

143
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,450
You can't just show up without a plan...

144
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,950
Sanji, I'm hungry!

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,860
What do we have for breakfast?

146
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,110
Sandwiches.

147
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,560
Yeah! I want a cotton-candy sandwich!

148
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll just have a cup of tea.

149
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm gonna have cola!

150
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,170
A glass of milk for me!

151
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,960
I think the best breakfast in the world is
Sanji-kun's sandwiches!

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,490
What is a sandwich?

153
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,370
I don't like bread!

154
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,840
I can't tell you why we were being chased.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,150
But we set sail for the
place called Zou originally.

156
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,220
Zou?

157
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,460
Do you know it?

158
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,740
It's another coincidence.

159
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,530
After handing over Caesar
and destroying the SMILE factory,

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,160
I was gonna head for Zou.

161
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,130
Really?!

162
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,870
Yes, my crew is already there.

163
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,260
I-If so, can we go along with you there?

164
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,180
Yes, you can! Let's go there
and then the Wano Kingdom!

165
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,020
Hey!

166
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,850
Thank you!

167
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,290
W-Well...

168
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,350
Luffy-dono, thank you for everything!

169
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,480
Everything!

170
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,550
Don't mention it!

171
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,100
Right, Tra-guy?

172
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,130
Pardon me.

173
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,540
Three samurais including me, and Momonosuke -

174
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,820
four of us headed for Zou

175
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,180
but our ship wrecked

176
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,340
and two of us samurais and Momonosuke
drifted to Dressrosa.

177
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,780
But we had been chased by
Doflamingo and the others there

178
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,120
and I ran into an unknown ship.

179
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,490
There, I met the children
who were looking to get treated.

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,370
And unfortunately, the ship left the port

181
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,930
before I knew it and headed for that island.

182
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,030
--Father!
--Oh no! Momonosuke!

183
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,820
I was gonna go after the ship

184
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,320
and my fellow samurai Kanjuro tried
to cover me but got caught!

185
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Go after Momonosuke! Don't worry about me!

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,870
He let me sail out to the sea!

187
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,020
I have to save him!

188
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,320
I have to go back!

189
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,260
What a man, Kanjuro!

190
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,460
Kanjuro!

191
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,030
Alright! I'm gonna go save him with you!

192
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,270
Guys! Don't forget our purpose!

193
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,100
Kanjuro!

194
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,960
Young Master-sama,
Trébol-sama is not here yet.

195
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,140
Okay.

196
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,020
Thank you for waiting.

197
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,980
NAVY

198
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,750
THE NAVY HEADQUARTERS

199
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,330
There are only seven Warlords in the world!

200
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,900
They are the pirates who
were chosen and given

201
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,300
the carte blanche for robbery
by the World Government

202
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,790
in exchange for their overwhelming strength
and notorious prestige!

203
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,500
Them taking sides with
the Government has to be

204
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,480
seen as a threat to all
other pirates in the world.

205
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,950
The greatest swordsman in the world!

206
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,950
"Hawk-Eye" Dracule Mihawk!

207
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,060
The king of Dressrosa
and a charismatic devil!

208
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,930
"Heavenly Demon" Don Quixote Doflamingo!

209
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,830
He is now the Navy's human weapon!

210
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,460
"Tyrant" Bartholomew Kuma!

211
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,310
The empress of Amazon Lily!

212
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,860
"Pirate Empress" Boa Hancock!

213
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,380
One of the Worst Generation

214
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,450
and the mastermind of the Rocky Port Incident!

215
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,290
"Surgeon of Death" Trafalgar Law!

216
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,200
And this man has become powerful rapidly
in last two years.

217
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,430
The leader of the Pirate Dispatch Organization
and a living legend.

218
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,110
"Star Clown" Buggy!

219
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,700
Are you surprised that I'm a Warlord?

220
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,680
You dummies!

221
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,380
It's not like I wanted to become one.

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,630
The World Government begged me in tears

223
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,520
so I accepted reluctantly!

224
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,540
But this is only the beginning.

225
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,590
No one can stop me from advancing!

226
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,350
I'm gonna join the Four
Emperors in a few years!

227
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,330
And I'm gonna become the King of...

228
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,510
And the man I told you about earlier.

229
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,240
They are the Seven Warlords.

230
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,640
But that all changed early this morning.

231
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,730
Doflamingo resigned out of the blue.

232
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,380
And we might need to expel Law

233
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,650
from the Warlords depending on his intention.

234
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,320
Together, they're one of the

235
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,460
Three Great Powers along with the
Navy HQ and the Four Emperors.

236
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,420
Things shouldn't be so unstable...

237
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,240
Yes, I know, Brandnew.

238
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
Fleet Admiral!

239
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,530
I'm not gonna let Law and Straw Hat
do whatever they want!

240
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,530
I got an annoying call from
Smoker of the G-5 yesterday.

241
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,200
Let's see how things go for today.

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,290
I sent Fujitora!

243
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,320
Your Majesty!

244
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,340
Please don't quit!

245
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,480
Doflamingo-sama!

246
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,550
Is it true what they say on the newspaper?!

247
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,640
Please tell us it's not true!

248
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,310
Trébol-sama!

249
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
Trébol-sama, where are you?!

250
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,210
Have you seen Trébol-sama?

251
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,120
No.

252
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,240
Okay.

253
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,130
I wonder what Young
Master-sama is going to do?!

254
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,930
If the Navy is gonna come to attack,
I want to fight-in!

255
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,300
We will just follow the Young Master.

256
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,170
Trébol-sama, where are you?

257
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,470
Oh, Baby 5!

258
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,870
What are you doing up there?!

259
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,390
Look! The whole kingdom is going crazy!

260
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,510
I'm sure the whole world is getting upset!

261
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,840
Hey, hey!

262
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,820
By the way, did you get
your fiancé killed again?

263
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,910
Too close!

264
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,930
Why do you keep asking me that?
You're so annoying!

265
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,700
Annoying but?

266
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,800
Annoying but what? Hmmm?

267
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,830
--Too close!

268
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Annoying but you like me, maybe?

269
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,350
That's enough!
Young Master-sama was calling you!

270
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,630
Young Master-sama?

271
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,070
He wanted you to bring that thing!

272
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,850
Stay away! You make me sick!

273
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,650
Hey, hey, hey!

274
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,590
You just keep getting your fiancé killed! Baby 5!

275
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,030
Stop choosing guys that would
be killed by Doffy and marry me!

276
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,110
Hmm, just kidding!

277
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,260
Do you...

278
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,190
...need me?

279
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,320
Cut it out!

280
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,790
The Colosseum is always packed.

281
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,460
Thanks to you, Diamante.

282
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,320
What are you saying?

283
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,950
Doffy, that's because
you're a charismatic king.

284
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,740
No.

285
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,980
That's because you're strong.

286
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,890
Stop. You make it sound like
I'm the hero of the Colosseum.

287
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,940
You are the hero of the Colosseum.

288
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,750
Stop saying that.

289
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,320
Okay, I stop.

290
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,000
Alright, I admit it if you insist!

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,260
Yes, I am the hero of the Colosseum!

292
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,320
I brought it!

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,370
Doffy, it's that thing!

294
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,780
You're too close!

295
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,240
Too close but?

296
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,810
But I like it. Sit down.

297
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,810
If Straw Hat Luffy finds out about this,

298
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,690
I'm sure he will try to get hold of it.

299
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,560
An alliance can sometimes prove a hindrance.

300
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,460
Diamante. I want to entrust this to you.

301
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,520
Wait a second, Doffy! I can't take it.

302
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,560
No, I want to entrust this to you.

303
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,940
Stop. You make it sound like
I'm some kind of genius.

304
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,940
I can only entrust this to a genius like you.

305
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,840
Stop saying that.

306
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,780
Okay, I stop.

307
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,630
Alright, I admit that I'm
a genius if you insist!

308
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,350
Yes! I can take care of
that dumb-ass Straw Hat!

309
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,450
I'll be counting on you!

310
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,660
I know he will jump at it!

311
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,710
The source of his late brother's power.
The Flare-Flare Fruit.

312
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm sure he wouldn't want
anybody else to have it!

313
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,480
I see an island!

314
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,460
I see it!

315
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,390
The Straw Hats see a shadow of an island.

316
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,310
What is that rocky island?!

317
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,590
We made it! It's Dressrosa!

318
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,530
You idiot! Don't shout!
Doflamingo will hear us!

319
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,610
No, he won't!

320
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,650
We'll save you soon, Kanjuro!

321
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,200
This is a kingdom of love
and passion - Dressrosa.

322
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,370
I can't wait!
