2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,980
On the voyage to their next destination,

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,020
Luffy and crew drop by
the resort ship, Spa Island.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,880
While enjoying their vacation,
they meet the sisters Sayo and Rina.

41
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,610
This is the ocean raccoon dog, Nukki.

42
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,820
Big Sis Sayo!

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,440
You're doomed now that
I've run into you, Straw Hat!

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,290
It's been a while, hasn't it?

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,480
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,330
It's about that notebook.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,810
Foxy and his goons are after it, aren't they?

48
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,270
This notebook explains how to create jewels!

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,850
Everyone, please help--

50
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,560
Luffy and crew managed
to repel the Foxy Crew,

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,470
which was after the sisters' notebook.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,440
It held the secret to their father's
research on making jewels.

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,390
But now Sayo has been taken hostage
by the mastermind, Doran!

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,360
"The Great Scramble for Treasure!
Collapse! Spa Island!"

55
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,380
Big Sis Sayo!

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,040
Dang! This ship is loaded with traps.

57
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,130
Boss, hang in there!

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,910
That was pathetic, "Silver Fox" Foxy.

59
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,070
They won despite your trickery.

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,030
Oh, well. Now I simply have to wait for
them to solve the secret of the jewels.

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,040
This just isn't enough to go by!

62
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,050
Didn't you search all over the ship?
Wasn't there a large "X" mark?

63
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,970
No... What should I do?

64
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,510
This notebook really is full of lies.

65
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,010
And now my sister is...

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,430
--Luffy!
--Huh?

67
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,730
Please save... Big Sis Sayo.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Sure.

69
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,320
Huh? You're sure? Really?

70
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,200
Yeah, I wanna see those jewels.

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,290
Even though this notebook could be lying?

72
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,290
But how are we going to save her, Luffy?

73
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,040
Let's see... Why don't we destroy this ship?

74
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,500
Whaaat?!

75
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,880
What?!

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,890
Where did that come from?!

77
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,610
Hey, man! Are you thinking straight?

78
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,430
What about Sayo?

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,710
We'll find her if we destroy the ship.

80
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,110
And the hint about the jewels?

81
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,680
It'll be easier to look for if we destroy the ship!

82
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,090
Let's get started.

83
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,860
Zoro?

84
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,450
There is no point worrying about something

85
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,110
that might not be on this ship, anyway.

86
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,280
I swear, you guys don't
have a shred of delicacy!

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,950
Nami-san, the idea of meekly obeying

88
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,690
that dastardly mustache irks me to no end.

89
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,960
I don't care if we sink this ship.

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,970
Gah! Not you too, Robin!

91
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,090
Isn't someone going to stop them?

92
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Those were the Captain's orders.

93
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,250
Oh, you're quick on the uptake!

94
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,240
Franky!

95
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,550
Please look after Sunny.

96
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,930
You've got it.

97
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,140
Super!

98
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,180
There goes the resort...

99
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
All right! Destroy this ship!

100
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,440
108-Pound Phoenix!

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,280
Concasser!

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,910
Gum-Gum Whip!

103
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,680
Tabasco Star!

104
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,420
Hoofprint Roseo!

105
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,730
Thunderbolt Tempo!

106
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Clutch!

107
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,690
Three-Pace Hum... Notch Slash!

108
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,080
Everyone is strong!

109
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,180
Give Sayo back!

110
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,400
Outta my way! Move! Move! Move!

111
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,820
Like those puny bullets can hurt me.

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,540
Wh-What?!

113
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,860
He repelled the bullets?

114
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,830
Owie!

115
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,370
Jerks! Now I'm ticked!

116
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,960
Weapons Left!

117
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,880
Hey! Come on and give Sayo back!

118
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,800
Curse you!

119
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,620
What is that?!

120
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,420
Is that a cannon?! I thought it was a chimney!

121
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,500
Big Sis!

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,530
Rina!

123
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,490
Damn it! He's taken her hostage.

124
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,870
How dare you wreak havoc on my ship?!

125
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,420
Do you realize how much
it cost to build Spa Island?

126
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,150
Damn that rotten mustached jerk!

127
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,780
Sayo!

128
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,490
Big Sis!

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,770
Big Sis Sayo!

130
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,580
Next I'm gonna blow that brat sky high!

131
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,760
Stop it!

132
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,860
I had originally wanted you to
solve the puzzle in that notebook,

133
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,900
but forget it! I'll be taking that notebook.

134
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,390
I'll give her back after you hand it over.

135
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,800
You can have the notebook,
so give Big Sis Sayo back!

136
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,610
Don't!

137
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't give it to him!

138
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,650
Big Sis Sayo...?

139
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,920
Rina, solve the secret in the notebook
and finish Dad's research!

140
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,660
No! Why should I?

141
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,020
Believe in Dad, Rina!

142
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,620
Don't give Dad's research to that jerk!

143
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,870
Dad was working to make his

144
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,130
dream come true for you, me, and everyone in the village.

145
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,970
Please! For my sake,
don't throw away Dad's dream!

146
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,690
You're lying! Dad is just
a self-absorbed researcher.

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,360
Rina...

148
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,400
I mean... I mean, he was
always in his own world!

149
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,110
"For Dad"

150
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,110
--It's done!
--It's done!

151
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,230
Do you think Dad will like his birthday cake?

152
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,120
Yep!

153
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,970
He isn't coming home!

154
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,700
I'm sure he must have found something again.

155
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,910
I'm going to bed!

156
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,740
Okay.

157
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,500
"For Dad"

158
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,500
A cake? Oh, yeah.

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,420
They must have baked a cake for me...

160
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,470
Dad...?

161
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,430
Did I wake you up?

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,920
What are these?

163
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,560
Cast-off Thirty Year Cicada shells.

164
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,420
I can probably use them in my research.

165
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,020
There was a big outbreak of them
for the first time in thirty years!

166
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,600
Is that right? Ah! But last night...

167
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,280
A cake! That cake looks delicious!

168
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,410
But that cake...!

169
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,370
We made that yesterday.

170
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,380
It may have gone bad. It is summer and all...

171
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,320
Doctor... Get a doctor...

172
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,440
He already saw you and left!

173
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,700
I don't care about him!
He doesn't know a thing about us!

174
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,020
He doesn't think about us!

175
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,430
Hey, this isn't the time to get in a fight...

176
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,340
Don't butt in.

177
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,740
This is their problem.

178
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,250
Rina, you're mistaken! Listen to me! Dad...

179
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,580
I'm sorry about the cake.

180
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,690
Dad...

181
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,350
You were looking forward to having
a birthday party, weren't you?

182
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,540
Yeah...

183
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,840
I need the materials in the

184
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,470
cast-off Thirty Year Cicada shells to make the jewels.

185
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,570
If I didn't get them now, I'd have
to wait another thirty years...

186
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,060
I had to go.

187
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,220
Uh-huh.

188
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,410
You aren't angry?

189
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,100
No...

190
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,060
I see. But I bet Rina is mad at me.

191
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,620
You are just like your mother,
but Rina takes after me.

192
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,520
She's a handful when she gets upset!

193
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,410
After I make some jewels,
let's eat a cake that's this big!

194
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,790
Yeah!

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,230
Let's get one that Rina could hide in.

196
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,880
Nukki says that it's all true.

197
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,210
And he said that your father
left home to protect you and Sayo

198
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,580
from some bad guys who
were after his jewel research.

199
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh, no...

200
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,230
What's this...?

201
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,830
I can't find one...

202
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,840
You have to work to find a four-leaf clover.

203
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,790
But Big Sis found three of them!

204
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,560
That's because she believed with all

205
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,510
of her heart that she would find them.

206
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,770
--She believed?
--Right!

207
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,640
Conducting research and searching
for four-leaf clovers are similar.

208
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,610
If you never stop believing and work hard,
it will pay off in the end.

209
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,310
Really? Then I'm going to find a five-leaf clover!

210
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,700
Huh? Five leaves...?

211
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,110
That'd be amazing!

212
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,490
I found one!

213
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,120
I found a five-leaf clover!

214
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,830
Th-That's... Rina!

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,170
You were right! I believed I could find one.

216
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,940
That's right, Rina! That's amazing!

217
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,020
Yay!

218
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,470
All right, Rina! I'm gonna
succeed with my research!

219
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,480
Yeah... I had forgotten all about that...

220
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,490
I used to believe he could pull it off.

221
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,690
This is Dad's dream! It has to come true.

222
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,190
Rina!

223
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,160
I've changed my mind! You can't
have the notebook after all.

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,990
Wh-What?!

225
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,800
It's show time!

226
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,970
Don't play games with me!

227
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,740
Seis Fleurs!

228
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,140
Tabasco Star Onslaught! Star! Star!

229
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,850
Nami, get on.

230
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,720
Uh-huh.

231
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,520
Sayo-chan!

232
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,700
Hurry! Untie her.

233
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,830
What is that?

234
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,580
A lock?!

235
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,560
Where did you come from?

236
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,590
Wait! What are you going to do?

237
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,510
Please wait!

238
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,350
Three-Sword Style...

239
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,600
...Great Buddha Slayer!

240
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,660
They're doing a great job.

241
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,120
Hey, you need to do a great job!

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,870
Curse you!

243
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,750
What's that?

244
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,260
The jerk! He released all
of the steam in the ship!

245
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,690
That's better!

246
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,830
Now die!

247
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,940
Let's go, Rina!

248
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,810
Yeah!

249
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,240
Third Gear!

250
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,460
Bone Balloon!

251
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,750
Giant Axe!

252
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,360
Boss!

253
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,620
What on earth is going on...?

254
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,370
What the heck?!

255
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,890
Later!

256
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,980
Stupid! Don't forget about
everyone who has to abandon ship!

257
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,740
Luffy, you're amazing!

258
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,140
Oops! I forgot that I shrink
when I use that move.

259
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,860
Huh?

260
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,370
Sheesh! Think ahead a little, will you?

261
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,350
A giant "X."

262
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,030
We did it!

263
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,070
Serves the jerk right!

264
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,100
An "X"! And it's huge.

265
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,510
Yep! Dad was referring to that
underwater volcano on the map.

266
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,580
Doran built his ship right above
the treasure he was searching for.

267
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,220
The doof didn't realize the key
to the secret was right under him.

268
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,200
Amazing!

269
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,830
That's... a circular rainbow!

270
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,580
I've never seen a round rainbow before.

271
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,250
Same here.

272
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,620
It's a mysterious rainbow! Awesome!

273
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,340
W-Wait a sec! Is that the treasure?

274
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,420
Huh?

275
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,900
Come to think of it, circular rainbows
are referred to as the "ocean's treasure."

276
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,260
What?!

277
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,850
Oh, man!

278
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,970
Th-That's it?

279
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,010
You better not tell me that this is the treasure.

280
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,540
Don't underestimate us!

281
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,450
Uh, well...

282
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,320
You can have all of the treasure!

283
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,910
Don't give us that!

284
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,650
Huh? That rainbow looks weird...

285
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,920
The order of the colors is inversed.

286
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,330
The order...?

287
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,360
What's wrong?

288
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,760
Just maybe...

289
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,700
"-Several Days Later-"

290
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,980
I think that might be...

291
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,540
You're the monster raccoon dog
from the other day!

292
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,490
No, it's an ocean raccoon dog.

293
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,870
A letter?

294
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,660
It looks like Sayo-chan's guess
was dead on back there!

295
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,730
"Dear Luffy and friends. Are you well?

296
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,110
My big sister and I went straight
home and tested out her idea."

297
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,670
We followed my father's formulas
and made seven different medications.

298
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,910
When we mixed them together in
the order of the circular rainbow...

299
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,950
It worked!

300
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,400
She says it created a jewel!

301
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,780
Yay! We did it! We did it!

302
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,030
Sayo... Rina...!

303
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,410
Is this it?

304
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,410
Cool!

305
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,750
That's a sign of their gratitude.

306
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,510
They say, "Thank you, guys."

307
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,180
Let me get a better look at it, Luffy.

308
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,250
--I wanna see it! Lemme see!
--Huh? Let's see it.

309
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,760
Wait! Just a sec.

310
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,650
Hey, guys! This isn't a toy.

311
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,360
What's going on?

312
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,370
It's candy rain! Ow, ow!

313
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,700
It's yummy!

314
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,130
Oops. I dropped the jewel.

315
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,610
--Which one is it?!
--Beats me.

316
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,710
Find it! Find it fast!

317
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,950
You guys had better find it!

318
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,420
Okay!

319
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,590
Why are you so excited, Brook?

320
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,790
After learning about the great feats
you've accomplished on your voyage,

321
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,310
I've realized I must work
to become a true comrade!

322
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,580
"A true comrade"? That's not
something you work toward.

323
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,870
Oh, dear!

324
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

325
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,970
"Brook's Great Struggle! Is the Path to
Becoming a True Comrade Rigorous?"

326
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
