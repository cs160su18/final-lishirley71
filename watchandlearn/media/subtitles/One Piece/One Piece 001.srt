2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,830
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,750
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,620
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,000
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,620
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,820
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,480
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,340
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:25,310
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,320
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,280
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,140
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,710
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,210
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,440
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
Whoa...

25
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,660
"I'm Luffy! The Man Who's
Gonna be King of the Pirates!"

26
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,600
No worries!

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,580
A whirlpool of that size
poses no problem to this ship!

28
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,250
Miss.

29
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,850
May I have this dance?

30
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,040
Alright!

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,810
Not again...

32
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,560
Batter out!

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,540
What're you doing?
You suck!

34
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,230
This thing's heavy!

35
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,310
Must be filled with booze, then!

36
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,530
It's all ours now!

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,080
Ship off the starboard stern!

38
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,770
There's a pirate flag on its mast!

39
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,630
It's a pirate ship!
Enemy raid! Enemy raid!

40
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,440
Captain! Pirates!

41
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,510
What?!

42
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,730
Everyone, stay calm!

43
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,990
Stay calm!

44
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,280
Follow instructions
in a calm manner!

45
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,420
Fire!

46
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,970
Coby!

47
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,500
Y-Yes, ma'am?!

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,070
Who's the most beautiful
of all on these seas?

49
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,920
T-This ship's captain,
Alvida-sama, of course!

50
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,960
Well done!

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,910
T-Thank you!

52
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,820
Alvida-sama.
This is our first prey in a while.

53
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,150
That's right!

54
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,880
Alright! Start pounding the ship!

55
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,290
Men! Show them the terror of
Iron Club Alvida, the woman pirate!

56
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,980
Coby! What're you doing?!

57
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,220
I-I'm not good
at this sort of thing...

58
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,140
Hmm?! Are you tryin'
to give me backtalk?!

59
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,940
P-Please, anything but the club!

60
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,610
Then get yer ass in gear!

61
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,660
We won't take yer lives, but
we will take all yer valuables!

62
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,790
Anyone who tries to fight back'll
wind up at the bottom of the ocean!

63
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,460
Hello...

64
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,210
There's no one in here, right?

65
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,510
What a relief...

66
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,240
That's a rather large barrel...

67
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,060
Who're you?!
Never seen you before!

68
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,450
Hey, coward!

69
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,190
Are you hidin' out in a
place like this again?!

70
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,990
N-No! I thought I'd haul this
big barrel of alcohol over...

71
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,600
We'll lighten it for ya!

72
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,080
I was just feelin' thirsty!

73
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,420
You can't! Alvida-sama
will kill us if she finds out!

74
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,160
Then you just need
to keep yer mouth shut!

75
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,880
Right, Coby?

76
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,510
Y-Yes! You're right!

77
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,720
Thing's pretty heavy!

78
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Can't wait!

79
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,850
Hold yer horses!
I'll bust it right open!

80
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,140
I slept great!

81
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,070
Huh?

82
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,230
Who're you guys?

83
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,990
No, who are you?!

84
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,150
That guy's gonna catch cold
if he sleeps there, y'know.

85
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,760
You did that!

86
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,910
Are you toyin' with us even
when you know we're pirates?!

87
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,150
Man, I'm hungry!
You got any food?

88
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,230
Listen when people are talking!

89
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,730
You damn kid!

90
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,410
Die!

91
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
What's the big idea?

92
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,550
W-Who are you?!

93
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,180
Me?

94
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,410
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.
Nice to meetcha!

95
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,490
What the...
What just happened?

96
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,770
What's with them?

97
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,020
R-Run, hurry! If they come back
with their friends, you'll be killed!

98
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,370
But man, I sure am hungry!

99
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,280
How can you be so carefree?!

100
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,580
There are still lots
more of them up on deck!

101
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,300
C'mon! This way!

102
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,710
H-H-Hey! Not this way!

103
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,960
Food! Food! Food!

104
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,270
Yes! Food!

105
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,600
Actually, they might
not find us in here!

106
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,280
Which should I choose?
This box?

107
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,570
Ooh, jackpot!

108
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,390
These look great!

109
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,820
M-My name is Coby.

110
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,660
You're Luffy-san, right?

111
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,530
That was incredible just now!
How did you do that?!

112
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,490
These things are great!

113
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,960
Is this a pirate ship?

114
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,970
No, it's a passenger ship that's
being raided by Alvida-sama.

115
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,700
Well, it doesn't matter.

116
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,940
Do you know if there
are any boats onboard?

117
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,290
I-I think so...

118
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,030
My ship got swallowed
by this giant whirlpool...

119
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,850
You mean that whirlpool?!

120
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,520
No one could survive that!

121
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,980
Boy, was that a real surprise!

122
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,800
Are you one of those pirates, too?

123
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,990
It was on that fateful day...

124
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,130
That day, I got in a boat on
the outskirts of town to go fishing...

125
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,960
...but it turned out the boat was
actually headed for a pirate ship.

126
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,650
It's been two years since...

127
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,490
In exchange for my life,
I've been forced to be a chore boy.

128
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,390
Man, you're dumb and stupid!

129
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,310
You're brutally honest...

130
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,920
If you don't like it, then run away!

131
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,370
I-I can't! No way! No way!

132
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,360
Just the thought
of Alvida-sama finding me...

133
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,500
...frightens me and makes
me weak in the knees--

134
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,090
Oh, you're a wimp, too?

135
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,700
Man, I hate you!

136
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,210
Hey, now! Quit dawdling!

137
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,000
Haul it all off before
the navy gets here!

138
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,110
Anyone caught dawdling
gets a taste of my iron club!

139
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,970
--What a haul!
--Seems like a pretty rich ship!

140
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,840
Hey! You'll get the club
if she catches you slackin' off!

141
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,890
Oh, whoops!

142
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah, one hit from
that and you're a goner!

143
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,100
Alvida-sama!

144
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,540
It's bad!

145
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,300
What is it?!
You're annoying me!

146
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,730
A b-b-barrel!

147
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,600
M-M-Monster!

148
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
Huh?!

149
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,400
Who're you calling a monster?!

150
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,660
N-No... Some weird guy
popped out of a barrel...

151
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,290
He might be...
a bounty hunter...

152
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,000
What?!

153
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,020
Yeah... That's right...

154
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,340
If only I had the courage to
drift the ocean in a barrel...

155
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,460
...there's actually
something I want to do, too...

156
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,550
Umm... What compelled you
to set out onto the sea, Luffy-san?

157
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

158
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,580
--K-K-King of the Pirates?!
--Yep.

159
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,260
--Are you serious?!
--Yeah.

160
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,090
Wait, you're a pirate, Luffy-san?!

161
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,960
Yep.

162
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
What about your crew?!

163
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't got one.
I'm just about to look for one.

164
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,920
K-K-King of the Pirates is
the title given to the person...

165
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,730
...who obtains everything in this world!

166
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,610
That means seeking the great
treasure of wealth, fame, and power...

167
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,420
...the One Piece!

168
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,140
Yup!

169
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,330
Yup?! Pirates all over the
world are after that treasure!

170
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,240
Me too!

171
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,360
No way! No way, no way, no way!

172
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,230
Absolutely no way!

173
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,920
There's no way you can stand at
the apex of this Great Pirate Era!

174
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,330
No way! No way!

175
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
Why did you hit me?

176
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,670
Just because.

177
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,240
But it's all right.
I'm used to it now...

178
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,020
It's not about whether I can or not.

179
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,270
I'm gonna do it because I want to.

180
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,140
I've decided to be the King of the Pirates,

181
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,820
so if I die fighting for that,
that's fine with me!

182
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,090
Now, then! My belly's full--
guess I'll go get me a boat!

183
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,740
I wonder if they'll give me one if I ask.

184
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,940
Hopefully they're generous.

185
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,500
I never once thought about it...

186
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,060
Do you suppose I can do it, too?

187
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,740
If I'm prepared to die for it?

188
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,630
Do what?

189
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,980
Do you think...
even I could join the navy?

190
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,750
Navy?

191
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!

192
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,720
It's been my dream ever since I
was little! Do you think I can do it?!

193
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
How should I know?

194
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,500
No! I'll do it! If I'm gonna be a
chore boy for the rest of my life,

195
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,990
then I'll break out of here and
catch even Alvida-sama-- no, Alvida!

196
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,110
You're gonna team up
with him to catch who?!

197
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,710
Huh, Coby?!

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,570
You don't seem to be Zoro, the pirate hunter.

199
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,470
Zoro?

200
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,030
Coby!

201
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,080
Who's the most beautiful
of all on these seas?!

202
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,490
O-Of course that would be--

203
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,950
Who's this big chunky lady?

204
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
--Chunky?
--Not good...

205
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,300
You runt!

206
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,260
Let's go!

207
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,860
Why, you...

208
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,530
Whoops!

209
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,010
It's not fair to attack from behind!

210
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,140
It's not fair to attack all at once!

211
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,440
Gotcha!

212
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,520
Gum-Gum...

213
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,270
...Rocket!

214
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,860
What?!

215
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,550
L-Luffy-san... What are you?

216
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,300
Me?

217
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,390
I'm a rubber person!

218
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,480
A rubber person?
You can't be serious!

219
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,810
You've eaten a Devil's Fruit, haven't you?

220
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,780
Yeah! The Gum-Gum Fruit!

221
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,990
I see! I'd heard the rumors,
but I guess they really do exist!

222
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,950
You also seem pretty skilled.
You a bounty hunter?

223
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm a pirate!

224
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,790
A pirate?! Hah!
All by yourself?!

225
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,340
It's just me right now, but I'll
find some more sooner or later!

226
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,580
Yeah... Ten crewmen sounds good to me!

227
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,300
Ah, so you're a pirate too, huh?!

228
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,890
Then that means you
and me are enemies, huh?

229
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,350
--L-Luffy-san! Let's get out of here!
--Why?

230
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,350
You saw how powerful her club is!

231
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,420
In these waters, she's the most--

232
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,210
I've decided to be
the King of the Pirates,

233
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,910
so if I die fighting for that,
that's fine with me!

234
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,710
I'm the most what?!

235
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,460
T-T-The...

236
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,520
The most ugly,
cragged old hag ever!

237
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,980
What did you say?!

238
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,070
I... I'm going to join the navy!

239
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,890
And then I'm gonna beat up pirates!

240
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,560
Do you even know
what you're saying?!

241
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,060
I do! I'm gonna do
what I want to do!

242
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,950
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna join the navy...

243
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,660
...and catch your lousy ass!

244
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,830
You damn pipsqueak!

245
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,440
No regrets! No regrets!

246
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,300
I said it! I fought! For my dream!

247
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,310
Well said!

248
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,180
That doesn't work!

249
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,360
What?!

250
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,900
'Cause I'm rubber!

251
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,460
Gum-Gum...

252
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,950
...Pistol!

253
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,820
The sky is so blue...

254
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,350
Hey!

255
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,190
--Yes?!
--Yes?!

256
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,670
Give Coby a small boat!

257
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,530
He's gonna join the navy!
Keep your mouths shut and let him go!

258
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,990
--R-Right!
--R-Right!

259
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,140
Luffy-san!

260
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,280
It's the navy!

261
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,060
Oh, perfect timing!
You should go see 'em!

262
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,120
But I'm a pirate! I'm outta here!

263
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,230
Get serious!

264
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,180
I can't just join the navy like this!

265
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,850
I'll be captured instead!

266
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,460
Looks like we managed to get away...

267
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,660
Whew, that was fun!

268
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,460
Umm, Luffy-san.

269
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,210
If you're heading for the One Piece,

270
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,320
--that means you're going
to the Grand Line, right?
--Yeah.

271
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,610
That place is also referred to
as a pirate graveyard, you know.

272
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,310
Yeah. That's why I need a strong crew.

273
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,100
What about that pirate hunter guy?
What's he like?

274
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,520
You mean Zoro?

275
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,900
I heard he's
being held prisoner at a navy base.

276
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,890
Aw, he's a weakling?

277
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,870
Nothing of the sort!
He's as terrifying as a demon!

278
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,200
Why are you asking about him?

279
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Thought I might have him join
my crew if he's a good guy!

280
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,800
You're being reckless again!

281
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,600
C'mon, he might be a good guy!

282
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,820
He's been caught
because he's a bad guy!

283
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,980
No! No way, no way, no way!
Absolutely no--

284
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,110
Why did you hit me?

285
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,140
Just because!

286
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,030
"To be continued"

287
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,320
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

288
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,240
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

289
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,460
before someone else could
beat me to it

290
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:52,510
If the world is going to change

291
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:59,610
before I can even attain my dream

292
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:06,720
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

293
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:19,640
so that my memories won't fade

294
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,190
Hey! I'll untie your ropes,
so join my crew!

295
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,900
I refuse to team up with a pirate!

296
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
Oh, come on. You're already
known as an evil bounty hunter.

297
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,750
Screw that! I ain't done a single
thing I regret! And I never will!

298
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,300
So I ain't gonna be a pirate!

299
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,410
I've decided you're gonna join me!

300
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,910
Quit deciding on your own!

301
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,710
"Enter the Great Swordsman!
Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro"

303
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,700
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
