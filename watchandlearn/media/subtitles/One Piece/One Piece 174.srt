00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,040
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,690
Impact.

19
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,930
Burn Blade!

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
Did you think you could
move faster than lightning?

21
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,580
Run! Wyper!

22
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,630
No!

23
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,080
Their voices... are disappearing!

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,090
Whoops. It seems the electricity
traveled along the Milky Road.

25
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,890
Fools...

26
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,600
"A Mystical City!
The Grand Ruins of Shandora!!"

27
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,100
Amazing!

28
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,910
You're incredible, Nami-san!

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,800
It's all yours now!

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,530
Yes, thanks!

31
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,800
I love it! It's so much faster!

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,860
Yes. Jet Dials went extinct
hundreds of years ago,

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,670
so I was shocked that the waver
you left with me had one onboard!

34
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,760
But, what do we do now?

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,440
We planned to lead you all
to the end of Skypiea, but...

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,560
Yeah.

37
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,730
For now, we need to get the ship
to the coast we agreed to meet at.

38
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,930
I really think they're all right...

39
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,110
Though, with those four together,
no one can stop them!

40
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,080
There's no four-person group on the island.

41
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,240
Eh?

42
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,720
At most, there's a two-person group.

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,040
If there were four people
moving together, I'd know!

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,760
It's Mantra... The thing
God and those priests use?

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,050
I was born able to use it!

46
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,980
That's why I'm afraid...

47
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,170
You have no idea how scary
it is hearing voices disappear!

48
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,130
Are you gonna cry again?

49
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,230
I am not crying, you stupid Blue Sea person!

50
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,130
Her waver broke down, and we passed by

51
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,920
just as a skyshark was about to attack her...

52
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,310
What were you planning to do?!

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't know! But I can't just
sit around doing nothing!

54
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,270
Laki... Everyone...

55
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,470
I hope everyone's alright...

56
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,550
Man, this is no good...

57
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,350
My bag's on the outside, and the
trees are all rotted and fruitless...

58
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,170
I was so looking forward to
that boxed meal for breakfast...

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,420
What a weird cave I wound up in.
I can't find the exit anywhere...

60
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,040
I wonder if everyone's
at the city of gold by now.

61
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,900
I bet it's pretty, all made out of gold...

62
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,770
That reminds me, I once heard at
a bar that gold stew tastes great...

63
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,700
I've walked a long way.
Guess I'll have that lunch...

64
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,330
Not too shabby!

65
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,090
Who's there?!

66
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,700
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't tell me you're after my food?!

67
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,930
Well, forget it!

68
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,960
Quit lookin' this way!

69
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,610
Quit following me!

70
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,890
Listen! I just ate all my food!
I don't got any more!

71
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,630
I wouldn't give you any, anyway!
Got it?! Now get lost!

72
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,540
Walkin' all weird-like...
Which way are you even facing?!

73
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,290
You wanna take me on?! Huh?!

74
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:04,030
In three hours, only five of the 81
people on this island will be standing.

75
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,390
Only one hour left until
the time I proclaimed is up...

76
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,310
Current number of survivors... 25.

77
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,780
This can't be! What is God Eneru doing here?!

78
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
He's going down!

79
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,400
Twenty-four left.

80
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,960
Oh, my. You're nothing but talk, Missy...

81
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,070
Stomach Mountain!

82
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,330
A runic statue!

83
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,890
Veinte Fleurs! Calendula!

84
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,760
How long are you going to keep
protecting this withered old city?

85
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,480
You don't seem to have any respect
for the vestiges of our ancestors.

86
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,960
I have no care for the past!

87
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,620
Fools always say that.

88
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,450
Who do you take me for?!

89
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,370
Punch Mountain!

90
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,900
I need to move away from the ruins

91
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,420
before this simpleton destroys it all!

92
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,510
Back then, I thought my goal had been lost

93
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,770
with the underground temple of Alubarna...

94
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,110
Having lost everything,
I decided to travel with Luffy.

95
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,610
But these ruins could hold clues
about the unspoken history

96
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,360
that's been lost to the world below!

97
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,430
How far are you going to run?

98
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,680
Is this as far as you run?

99
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,960
Yes.

100
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,270
It's too late now.

101
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,270
Too late?

102
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,230
Even if you repent, I won't forgive you!

103
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,930
You won't forgive me? You certainly
do adore those shabby ruins.

104
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,650
Especially when they
don't even belong to you...

105
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,440
That's right. The ruins belong to no one.

106
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,540
I don't feel like talking with you anymore.

107
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,290
Don't worry. You won't have to anymore...

108
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,040
...because you're going to
be crushed to death now!

109
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,050
Drop Mountain!

110
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,930
I can go all out here!

111
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,570
Treinta Fleurs!

112
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,270
All you can do is rush forward like a bull...

113
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,140
Realize the weight of
the history you destroyed!

114
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,060
Hang!

115
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,700
He weighs so much!

116
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,320
Take this! 10-Axe Combo!

117
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,580
Axe Mountain!

118
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,460
My eyes!

119
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,060
What are you-- Huh?!

120
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,010
Wait! The dials... they're backwards!

121
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,240
Wait! The dials--!

122
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,740
What you went around destroying
were great, priceless treasures.

123
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,980
Relics so rare it's impossible
to measure their worth.

124
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,870
History may repeat itself,
but people can't go back in time.

125
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,390
You don't understand that.

126
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,650
I... I understand...

127
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,450
I won't ever... do it again...

128
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,040
Please forgive...

129
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,050
I will not.

130
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,880
In that case... I just need to kill you!

131
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,090
My fingers! My fingers!

132
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,420
Cien Fleurs!

133
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,850
Delphinium!

134
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,200
What the...?! Stop!

135
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,440
Wait! Where are you--

136
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,070
Stop!

137
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,030
It's too late for that now...

138
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,630
Can't breathe...

139
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Clutch!

140
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,530
Just awful...

141
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,070
This should be the center of the city,

142
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,300
but it doesn't match up with
the map on the monument at all.

143
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,140
Did everything get broken up in
the shock of coming into the sky?

144
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,520
I don't get it... Then why did you come here?

145
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,110
What one expects and what
one hopes are different things.

146
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,860
What I was seeking was the Rio Poneglyph.

147
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,810
The only "stone that tells the
real history" among the Poneglyphs

148
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,160
that are scattered throughout the world.

149
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,740
That's the Rio Poneglyph...

150
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,450
What do you mean by the "real history"?

151
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,850
I give up... I've searched for it
for 20 years and I'm out of clues...

152
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,870
This place was my last
hope... and a failure...

153
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,690
Dying here like this would
be a fitting end for me...

154
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,990
Living like this has exhausted me...

155
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,090
All I want is to learn the history...

156
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,120
But there're too many enemies...
to achieve my dream...

157
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,660
That's strange...

158
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,830
This is the city of gold?!

159
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,530
The size and topography
are all completely different.

160
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,230
And what's most unnatural of all...

161
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,000
The only entrance is at the top...

162
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,250
Could it be?!

163
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,030
I can go below!

164
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,420
It's so vast... These ruins
really do go much deeper!

165
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,330
I thought it was strange how Blue Sea ruins

166
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,050
had Island Clouds for ground...

167
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,260
The ruins above are nothing more
than the upper parts of the city,

168
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,270
eaten up by Island Clouds...

169
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,310
There's still more below!

170
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,070
Light?!

171
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,750
800 years ago, the city
of Shandora suddenly fell.

172
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,240
It hardly seems that way.
It's still so majestic and grand!

173
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,050
This is Shandora, the city of gold!

174
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,450
Could it be?!

175
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,460
Let me ask you a question...

176
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,910
By any chance... can the
untold history be uncovered?

177
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,700
Are you saying that the
Poneglyphs hold that record?

178
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,320
They wrote with the ancient
Poneglyph symbols so easily!

179
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,810
But only the ones who made the
Poneglyphs could use these symbols!

180
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,910
"Hold our true motive in your
hearts and speak not of it.

181
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,230
We are the ones who weave history...

182
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,670
With the sounding of the grand belfry..."

183
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:59,360
That's right! Noland's logbook did
mention a giant gold bell here...

184
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,730
All of the city's writings were burned...

185
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,950
The city's history was eradicated!

186
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,290
They'll manage somehow, right?

187
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,760
Quit following me!

188
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,520
Now it goes down?

189
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,940
A Poneglyph was carried into the city!

190
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,180
There's no question about it!
This city fought against hostility!

191
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,750
Shandora, the city of gold, fought and fell

192
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,470
trying to protect that Poneglyph!

193
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,370
In which case, the grand belfry
located in the center of the four altars

194
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,620
might contain the "text of real history"...

195
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,880
The Rio Poneglyph!

196
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,870
Racing full speed ahead as always

197
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,620
A to Z, we run through it

198
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,420
We all have worries and fall many times

199
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,340
But we just need to rise to the top someday

200
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,810
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

201
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:39,870
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

202
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,370
I never treat you "bad"

203
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,070
How many times did we fall?

204
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:55,160
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

205
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,700
Smile! Come back to you, friends

206
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,510
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

207
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,430
Come back to you, friends

208
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,270
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

209
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,970
Come back to you, friends

210
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,250
Hey, you stupid bird!
Where're you taking me?!

211
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,330
What's with this cave?! Where's the exit?!

212
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,150
Yikes! The giant snake!
It seems irritable for some reason!

213
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,670
Aah! Why is this snake coming after us?!

214
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,090
Huh? Looks like we got us
some ferocious ones here...

215
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,340
On the next episode of One Piece!

216
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,120
"0% Survival Rate! Chopper vs. Ohm,
the Sword Wielding Priest"

217
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
