00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

Since the day that the dream began

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,360
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,790
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,630
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,750
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,550
where the New Fish-Man Pirates  who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,370
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,910
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,000
and involved in an all-out war!

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,790
Surume!

82
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,150
So you were doing everything he says
in order to save your brother's life?

83
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,480
I know how you feel.

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,100
Is it your younger brother or older brother?

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Let me try to save his life too!

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,030
Did you forget?

87
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm your friend!

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,990
Second Gear!

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,720
"The Noah Closing in! The Fish-Man
Island Facing Destruction!"

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,730
I can't believe it! That's...

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,390
...the Ship of Promise! "Noah"!

92
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,660
W-Why...

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,820
Why is it moving?!

94
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,830
Who is doing it and how?!

95
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,790
Th-This is no good!

96
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,860
What's the matter, Father?

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,760
It's a bit strange,  but
why are you so upset?

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,270
It's just a relic from history.
It serves no purpose.

99
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,650
No! We can't let anything
happen to that ship-jamon!

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,300
Until the proper day comes, no one
is allowed to move that ship-jamon!

101
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,870
Captain Hordy!

102
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,710
I thought he took a lot of Energy
Steroids and became a monster!

103
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,410
No, look!

104
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,890
Straw Hat!

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,730
He's pretty tough.

106
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,560
We found Shirahoshi!

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,150
Over here!

108
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,400
Um... What do you three want?

109
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,040
We can't let you live!

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,690
We have to kill you!

111
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,610
Surume!

112
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,020
Surume-sama, you are very strong!

113
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,390
Protect Yowahoshi!

114
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,310
Straw Hat!

115
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,890
Do you know what Fish-Man Karate is?!

116
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,690
His head is gone!

117
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,560
He did it with a single blow!

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,690
It's not gonna work. Because
I'm made of rubber!

119
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,700
Your skill is nothing compared to Jimbei's!

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,040
Of course! That's why you
shouldn't depend on fake power!

121
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,600
Head; Hardening!

122
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,420
Iron Shell Squad!

123
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,650
Yes, sir!

124
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,960
You fool! Your head's gonna crack open!

125
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,180
Gum-Gum...

126
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,260
...Bell!

127
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,890
His head was harder than iron!

128
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,070
Armament; Hardening!

129
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,330
What?!

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,060
Shark Arrows!

131
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,690
He doesn't get hit at all!

132
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,110
Does he know when they come?!

133
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,170
Amazing, Luffy-sama!

134
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,200
That's the Observation Haki!

135
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,910
Gum-Gum...

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,880
...Bullet!

137
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,230
Captain Hordy!

138
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,950
Luffy-sama, he is unbelievably strong!

139
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,920
He's great! Straw Hat Luffy!

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,130
So that's how strong the
world-renowned pirate is!

141
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,650
What's going on?!

142
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,030
What is it?

143
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,140
What?! I-Is that...

144
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,250
...the Noah of the Fish-Man District?!

145
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,790
Why is the Noah in the air over the island?!

146
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,760
It's heading towards this plaza!

147
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,090
It's almost broken through
the bubble around the island!

148
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,560
Once the bubble pops, the island is
finished! We're all gonna get washed away!

149
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,650
--What is that?!
--The Noah?!

150
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,360
Super big!

151
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,480
Once the ship hits, the whole
island will be destroyed!

152
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,730
Who's operating it?!

153
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,330
I don't think it has an engine!

154
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,960
--What is that?!
--It's gigantic!

155
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't know what's happening
but we're all dead!

156
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,100
I wonder if the sea will turn red
if we all get smashed at once.

157
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,010
Don't say things like that! Stop it!

158
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,890
--Evacuate!
--Get into the water off the island!

159
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,770
F-Folks?

160
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,620
It's...!

161
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,680
Ouch! I slipped!

162
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,390
You're Wadatsumi - working for Decken!

163
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,700
Captain Vander Decken! I fell off!

164
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,330
Stop the ship! I don't wanna die!

165
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,290
Decken?! What's going on here?

166
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,350
Captain Hordy, are you all right?!

167
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,320
Um, is this one of your strategies?!

168
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
It looks like Decken is operating the ship!

169
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,850
Shut up, you good-for-nothings!

170
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,850
Damn, Straw Hat!

171
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,330
Huh?

172
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,650
How tough can he be?! I attacked
him with the Armament Haki!

173
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,590
Did you say Decken? That crazy pirate!

174
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,290
This is not a part of the plan!

175
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,330
Shirahoshi!

176
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,680
Accept my love!

177
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,960
Did you hear me, Shirahoshi?

178
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,800
That must be...!

179
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,790
Princess Shirahoshi!

180
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,270
Don't tell me Decken threw the Noah
like he threw those letters and axes!

181
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,530
I've been loving you for 10 years
since you were just a little kid.

182
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:30,740
There is no one who could love you
like I do in all the wide world!

183
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,540
It's my love! Love, love!

184
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,230
L-O-V-E!

185
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,580
Why can't you just accept it?!

186
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,590
Things that I throw with
my Mark-Mark Fruit power...

187
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:51,220
...won't stop until they crash into
something or hit their target!

188
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:58,430
Noah the giant ship! It embodies
my love for you! Accept it!

189
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:05,420
And drop dead along with all the
Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi!

190
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,660
Captain Decken! What about me?!

191
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,470
Wadatsumi! It's too late! It's
impossible for me to save you!

192
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,120
So I need you to become a sacrifice upon
Shirahoshi's death, along with the island!

193
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,510
No!

194
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,160
This is it! The bubble is gonna pop!

195
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,400
We're doomed!

196
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,570
Hey, where did Princess Shirahoshi go?!

197
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,730
Oh? She's not there!

198
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,030
What?! Princess! Princess Shirahoshi!

199
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,620
What? Shirahoshi disappeared?!

200
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,470
N-No way!

201
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,870
I am over here!

202
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

203
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,360
--Princess Shirahoshi!
--When did she go up there?!

204
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,780
Yowahoshi...

205
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,680
Mermaid Princess!

206
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,890
Shirahoshi! Why did she do that?!

207
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,000
Because that ship is flying towards her!

208
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,750
What? Then she...

209
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,400
That's the girl that I love!

210
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,780
I thought you wanted to take just my life!

211
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:33,420
If I am the only one who you want to kill,
please do not harm the other people...

212
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,460
...of the Ryugu Kingdom!

213
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,590
Come and get me!

214
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,760
--Princess-sama!
--Princess!

215
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,220
Look! The Noah is changing its course!

216
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,420
It's heading towards
Princess Shirahoshi-sama!

217
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,380
Shirahoshi!

218
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,510
Don't do this, Shirahoshi-chan!

219
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,970
So, that crazy Decken bastard...

220
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,740
He was gonna crush us all
along with the island.

221
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,950
How dare he betray us!

222
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,590
Don't try to help us!

223
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,920
Can we do something to save her?!

224
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,880
How amazing!

225
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,010
How amazingly beautiful you are,
Shirahoshi! Even your mind!

226
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,320
You're trying to take the
matter into your own hands

227
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,230
in order to save the country,
aren't you, Shirahoshi?!

228
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,730
Shirahoshi!

229
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,340
Shira... hoshi...

230
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,710
You're eligible to become Vander
Decken IX's wife as I thought!

231
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,840
You better die while you're still
beautiful and live in my heart forever!

232
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,410
Shirahoshi!

233
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,370
--Princess-sama!
--How could you do that!

234
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,930
--Don't do that!
--Run, Princess!

235
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,260
Damn Yowahoshi! I told her to stick with me!

236
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,520
Straw Hat! Captain Hordy!

237
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,940
Oh? Where did Hordy-san go?

238
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,280
Look! He's up there!

239
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,860
He's heading for the Noah!

240
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,530
Don't mess with me, Vander Decken!

241
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,340
But I like this idea!

242
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,150
That bastard! How dare
he hurt Shirahoshi-chan!

243
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,070
Sanji, wait!

244
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,260
I'll go up there! You stay here
and take care of the plaza!

245
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,970
All right!

246
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,100
But Luffy, the ship is in the water!

247
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,650
Do you think the ship is
filled with water, Jimbei?

248
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,220
I don't know but I know Decken
is a Devil Fruit eater.

249
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,930
Which means there must be air for him!

250
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,890
Take this with you!

251
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,020
It's a coral that produces bubbles!

252
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,940
Thanks!

253
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,370
I'll be counting on you to save
my beloved Shirahoshi-chan!

254
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,910
You ready, Luffy?!

255
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,020
Go ahead!

256
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,880
Attempting to save Fish-Man Island.

257
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Shirahoshi lures the Noah away.

258
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,710
After Luffy follows her,

259
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,800
he's cornered into an underwater battle
at a severe disadvantage against Hordy.

260
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,390
Then, Shirahoshi

261
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,890
in order to finish things!

262
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

263
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,870
"Hurry up, Luffy! Shirahoshi's
Life in Jeopardy!"

264
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
