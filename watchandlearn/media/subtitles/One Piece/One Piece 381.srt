2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,810
Laboon, I swear that we will come back!

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,450
Please be here waiting for us!

49
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,790
Laboon, if you have been waiting
there for the past fifty years,

50
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,870
could you give me just another year or two?

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,790
I take pride in being a pirate!

52
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,920
If you are facing the wall,

53
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,720
I want to greet you from the
front, just like I promised!

54
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,430
"A New Crewmate!
The Musician, Humming Brook!"

55
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,980
Hey, skeleton!

56
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,810
Are you done singing?

57
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,230
Sing another song! Just one more!

58
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,330
My crewmates and I poured
our lives into this song.

59
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,680
It is the Rumbar Pirates'
"Great Choral Number."

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,760
I listened to this countless
times while wandering

61
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,560
the dark, dark foggy seas
by myself for 50 years.

62
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,770
--Ha! Hi-ho! Hi-hi!
--Heehaw! Heehaw!

63
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,600
When I was all alone on that large ship,

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,800
this song was the only thing
that helped me feel alive.

65
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,940
But now that I bear new
determination in my heart,

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,420
today I shall seal this Tone Dial.

67
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,140
It's sealed!

68
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,760
Your head really is a storage unit?!

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
I learned that Laboon is
happily waiting for me!

70
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,180
I have my shadow back!

71
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,230
I'm out of the Devil's Sea!

72
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,200
The voices we recorded on this dial no

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,810
longer exist to help me recall the past.

74
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,710
I am supposed to take this song to Laboon!

75
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,610
Every single day was filled with pain.

76
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,930
To be honest, I couldn't see a ray of light.

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,220
But you know, Luffy-san...

78
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,690
I-I...

79
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,980
I'm glad to be alive!

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,920
I am truly glad to be alive!

81
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,460
Of course you are!

82
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,510
And it's all because of today!

83
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,410
Ah!

84
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,480
May I join your crew?

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,680
Yeah, sure.

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,110
What?! That was quick!

87
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,940
He joined!

88
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,530
Eh?!

89
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,900
But we're glad to have you!

90
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,320
Hurray for the musician!

91
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,910
The musician died and now
he's nothing but bones!

92
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,910
I've been wanting a musician!

93
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,460
The musician is extremely light!

94
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,870
And that is one of your charms!

95
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,990
It's one of your charms!

96
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,510
Yep! I'm as light as bones!

97
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,210
--I'm as light as bones! I'm as light as bones!
--He's hilarious!

98
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,180
--I'm as light as bones! I'm as light as bones!
--I get it already!

99
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,960
Our ship is going to grow even livelier.

100
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,550
Why do we always attract such a quirky crowd?

101
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,010
I'm not sure what happened,
but you guys seem happy, Namizo.

102
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,610
Yep! Thank you.

103
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,310
We don't know what the deal is, but...

104
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,740
Cheers!

105
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,950
We're totally lost, but...

106
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,700
Cheers!

107
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,360
45 degree angle!

108
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,430
What the heck?

109
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,710
Laboon...

110
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,490
I will not pull back.

111
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,240
We have always looked
straight ahead in our voyage.

112
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,070
That was the path that
would take us back to you.

113
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,710
As I travel around the world,
you're waiting at the goal!

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,370
Isn't that right?

115
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,980
That is why I will not pull back.

116
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,090
I swear that I will go to you.

117
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,090
Please wait for me!

118
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,900
Wait just a little longer...

119
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,540
Huh?

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
What's the matter, Laboon?

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,340
You're in an unusually good mood today.

122
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,320
Let me introduce myself anew!

123
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,280
A wanted poster? You're a wanted man?

124
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,480
I apologize for the late introduction.

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,790
I am the dead and skeletonized Brook.

126
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,000
I have a bounty.

127
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,070
I am known as the Humming Brook.

128
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,830
My bounty is for 33 million Berries.

129
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,450
A long time ago, I was the leader of
a certain kingdom's assault convoy.

130
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,000
After that, I was the acting
captain of the Rumbar Pirates.

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,390
I am a musician and a swordsman!

132
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:32,610
As of today, my life is in the hands
of Captain Straw Hat Luffy!

133
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,240
I will work myself to the bone
to avoid tripping everyone up.

134
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,000
All right! Let's have another drink!

135
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,400
"Two Days Later"

136
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,110
This is wonderful! Thank you,
Franky-san and Usopp-san!

137
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,020
It's cool, really! Don't
think anything of it.

138
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,190
My design won!

139
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,960
I picked the flowers.

140
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,900
Thank you so much, Chopper-san.

141
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,090
Stupid! That doesn't make me
the least bit happy, silly!

142
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,740
This is a truly wonderful grave.

143
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,090
I couldn't possibly put all of those
bones on that cute Lion-chan.

144
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,230
From now on, call her the Thousand Sunny.

145
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,260
Strangely enough, the island on Thriller Bark

146
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,230
came from the West Blue,
which is where we were from.

147
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:04,350
Perhaps they will find some rest
if they sleep on familiar soil.

148
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,440
Well, Brook, we're gonna head on back.

149
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
--See ya!
--Later!

150
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,280
All right.

151
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,190
Oh, you startled me.

152
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,400
Are you sure you should be up?

153
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,250
Yeah. I overslept a bit.

154
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,360
What is that?

155
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,330
My dead sword, Yubashiri.

156
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,170
Please let me lay it to rest here.

157
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,430
Luffy will become the King of the Pirates!

158
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,870
Excuse me...

159
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,580
N-No, it's nothing...

160
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,880
Oh, yes! I've joined your crew.

161
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,050
That right? Your luck really does bite.

162
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,830
Our crew is a handful.

163
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,710
So it would seem! I'll work myself to death!

164
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,720
Ah, but I'm already dead.

165
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,740
All right! Now that Zoro
is up, let's hit the seas!

166
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,780
Time to head out for our next adventure!

167
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,550
Yeah!

168
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,490
Huh? Zoro, did you remove
your bandages again?!

169
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,730
Yeah, they hampered my movement.

170
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,220
They were meant to keep
you from moving! Wait!

171
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,430
You seem awfully anxious to go.
Are you really setting sail?

172
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,310
You guys can have Brook's ship.

173
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,620
I fixed the rudder and sails.

174
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,840
Thank you.

175
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,850
You guys have been such
a big help in so many ways!

176
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,510
I owe you so much!
I couldn't begin to thank you.

177
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,390
I'd love to marry you.

178
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,480
You're a great catch, but unfortunately,

179
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,950
I'm just too cool. It wouldn't work out.

180
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,270
I hate to see you guys go!

181
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,160
Let's party for another two or three days.

182
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,690
Nope! Our next stop is Fishman Island.

183
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,780
I'm dying to get there!

184
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,410
I bet it's full of fascinating people!

185
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,450
I'll get to frolic with beautiful mermaids!

186
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,830
Would it be all right if I asked the
mermaids to show me their panties?

187
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,260
Hey, man! Don't be stupid!

188
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,500
Mermaids don't wear panties.

189
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,640
Mermaids are stinking gorgeous!

190
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,070
The Pirate Empress Hancock
is nothing compared to them!

191
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,100
Mermaid! Mermaid!

192
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,780
--Mermaid! Hurray!
--Doesn't their lower half look like a fish tail?

193
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,440
--Mermaids! Love them!
--How come you know so much about them?

194
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,220
--Mermaid! Mermaid! Oh, baby!
--Oh, we passed through on
our way here three years ago.

195
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,960
--Mermaid! They're wonderful!
--Fishman Island was incredible!

196
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,030
Lola, you went to the New World?

197
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,700
I didn't go there. That's where I was born.

198
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,970
My mama is a pirate.

199
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,590
Oh, yeah!

200
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,710
This is my mama's Vivre Card.
You may have a piece.

201
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,770
It's paper?

202
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,940
Wow, you're lucky! Captain Lola's
mama is an amazing pirate!

203
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,650
Take good care of that!
I'm sure it will come in handy later.

204
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,140
What is a Vivre Card?

205
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,600
Huh? You don't know?

206
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,860
Captain Lola, Vivre Cards are
only available in the New World!

207
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,910
Oh, really?

208
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,780
This isn't your typical sheet of paper.

209
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,890
Water and fire can't hurt it.

210
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,410
If you take your nail clippings to a shop,

211
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,290
they will make a special sheet
of paper that mixes them in.

212
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,720
It is known as the
"Paper of Life," the Vivre Card!

213
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,060
You can tear off a piece and give it
to family and friends who are leaving.

214
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,640
And then?

215
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,880
Just watch. This is the Vivre Card
that my mama gave to me.

216
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,680
Ah, it moved!

217
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,350
No matter where in the world you are,
the pieces will pull toward each other.

218
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,190
So I always know which
direction my mama is in!

219
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,740
Of course, it doesn't
indicate how far away she is.

220
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,290
Wow, that's amazing! Is the New World
filled with things like that?

221
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,200
Isn't it handy? I'll sign
my mama's Vivre Card,

222
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,290
so if you ever run into trouble,
use this to get to her.

223
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,200
When you see her, let her
know that I'm doing well.

224
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,930
Thank you, Lola!

225
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,640
I might have one of those.

226
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,340
That thought just occurred to me as well.

227
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,440
Isn't this identical to the white
paper that Ace gave to you?

228
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,690
That scrap of paper will bring you
and me together again sometime.

229
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,370
So that's what he meant...

230
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,440
This is it! Huh?

231
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,790
It's kinda burnt. And it's smaller now.

232
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,290
Let me see that right quick!

233
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,000
This is definitely a Vivre Card.

234
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,250
I hadn't told you this yet, but it
also reveals the owner's vitality.

235
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,230
Isn't this person dear to you?

236
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,940
Yeah! He's my big brother.

237
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,730
Lola...?

238
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,160
I hate to say this, but his life...

239
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,790
is burning out.

240
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,830
What?!

241
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,760
Hey!

242
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,110
--Take care!
--Hey!

243
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,570
Goodbye, guys!

244
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,400
I will never forget what you've done for us!

245
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,320
The sun! Thank you for
bringing the sun back to us!

246
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,200
Everyone, careful not to get wiped out!

247
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,380
Don't jinx them, jerk!

248
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,640
Lola, thank you for the
Vivre Card! Take care!

249
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,310
Say hi to Mama if you see her!
Let's meet again, Namizo!

250
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,040
We're off!

251
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,490
They're gone, aren't they?

252
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,420
They sure are.

253
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,120
The fog is rolling back in.
We'll set sail tomorrow!

254
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,350
No one knows what happens in the
Florian Triangle's mysterious waters.

255
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,670
Every year, over 100 ships
disappear in the fog.

256
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:03,310
That is an old mystery that began before
the giant pirate ship, Thriller Bark,

257
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,290
began to lurk in the shadows
of that sea ten years ago.

258
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,610
It just so happens that, once again today,

259
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,030
the dense, white fog is covering the

260
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,700
eerie face of the sea with its white vale.

261
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,930
Luffy!

262
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,130
Are you really sure?

263
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,350
Oh, you mean about Ace's paper?

264
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,730
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

265
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,820
Luffy-san, I don't mind.
We can take a detour.

266
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,310
By now, time is of little
consequence to me and Laboon.

267
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,780
"Live" and "Reunite." Those are my mottos!

268
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,860
Luffy, everyone is cool with taking a detour.

269
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,700
It's cool! It's cool!

270
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,370
Yeah! Let's go see your whale of a brother!

271
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,330
No, it's okay. Honest!

272
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,140
If he is in trouble, I doubt he'd want me
to worry every time this happens.

273
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,720
Ace hates it when people see him look weak.

274
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,770
Even if we went, he'd just yell at me.

275
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,140
When we meet, we will be enemy pirates.

276
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,780
Ace has adventures of his own.

277
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,390
That Vivre Card shrinks when
its owner is in a weakened state.

278
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,580
When he gets better,
it returns to its original size.

279
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,110
Yep! We won't meet until then.

280
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,370
That's why Ace gave this paper to me, right?

281
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,240
Come to think of it, Zoro,
you still haven't done this,

282
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,800
since you were asleep the whole time!

283
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,460
So, I'll take it from the top.

284
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,550
Let's drink to our new crewmate,
the musician, Brook!

285
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,060
Cheers!

286
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,970
Thank you for having me!

287
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,930
Okay! Pull up the sails!

288
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,470
Let's fly with a Coup de Burst!

289
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,780
Yeah!

290
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,450
Coup de Burst!

291
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,660
What is this?!

292
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,910
Blue waters and a shining sun! This is bliss!

293
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,100
There are a bunch of neat things here.

294
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,960
You're... Split-Head!

295
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,670
Who are you calling "Split-Head"?!

296
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,770
I'll put an end to your wisecracks
with my new technique!

297
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,970
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,260
"The Slow-Slow Menace!
'Silver Fox' Foxy Returns!"

299
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
