00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,870
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,300
God's Land, Upper Yard...

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,020
The nightmarish survival game
continued to rule over this land.

20
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,790
Around the time that Nico Robin
finally found the city of gold, Shandora,

21
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,550
Chopper encountered
Priest Ohm in the Upper Ruins...

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,920
...and sadly fell by his hand.

23
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,750
There are no means to survive on
the sad path to attaining peace.

24
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,890
This is the Iron Ordeal,
with a survival rate of 0%!

25
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,220
No!!

26
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Where's the exit?!

27
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,570
Meanwhile, at Giant Jack's Upper Ruins,

28
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,290
four of the survivors were about
to engage in a fierce new fight.

29
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,790
What is this place? Ruins?

30
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,620
Looks like we got us
some ferocious ones here.

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,800
Hey! Hand over the gold!

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,830
Oh, my. How sad...

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,860
...given that none can
escape from my Iron Ordeal...

34
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,940
If you're going to get in my way,
I'll eliminate you all!

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,280
Tell me where Eneru and the Divine Squad are!

36
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,780
What's going on with this cave?!

37
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,410
Well, I'm sure you gentlemen
have all sorts of things to say,

38
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,080
but if you want to make yourselves heard...

39
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,370
...you'll need to survive here first!

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,570
"Climb Giant Jack!!
Deadly Combat in the Upper Ruins"

41
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,570
That said, the time prophesied
by God is fast approaching.

42
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,390
So you can't possibly survive.

43
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,650
Prophesied?

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,660
If you did not want anything,
you could have lived longer.

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,840
You might as well repent your
sinful life with all your heart.

46
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,690
Ha! So I take it you're one of those
priests or whatever that serves God?

47
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,430
Things like God or
prophecies don't interest me.

48
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,080
Right now, my only business
here is taking the gold.

49
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,880
I'll forgive that, too.

50
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,060
Huh?

51
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,800
Your only salvation lies in the fact

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,940
that no one can escape from my Iron Ordeal.

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,010
I'll save you all.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,530
Hmph! You sure like to talk high and mighty.

55
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's go, Holy. You can
get as wild as you want.

56
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,370
He is our target, Pierre.

57
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,910
We have to stop Eneru's priest first!

58
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,520
But to think that giant snake

59
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,540
ended up all the way up here...

60
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,850
Dammit!

61
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,690
This place doesn't break.
It just goes horizontal and vertical.

62
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,670
This cave is messed up!!

63
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,450
You can all...

64
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,380
Hm?

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,590
...die together!!

66
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,930
That's one pesky weapon you've got there!

67
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,600
You Blue Sea people don't know anything!

68
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,360
There's nothing here for you,
who just came to the sky!

69
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm not about to figure out
every one of your problems!

70
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,040
The situation in the sky is not our concern!

71
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,740
That figures!

72
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,660
I was going to eliminate you
from the start! No skin off my back!

73
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,500
Die!!

74
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,220
This guy's tougher than I thought.

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,740
Die!!

76
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,930
That's right... He's got poisonous fangs!

77
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,790
This one's got fangs, too!

78
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,520
What's with this dog's moves?!

79
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,900
His name is Holy.

80
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,370
I'm warning you. I'm a stockbreeder in
the sky, in other words, a Sky Breeder!

81
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,100
My animal training goes
beyond ordinary training.

82
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,970
I hammered bipedal walking
and then even boxing into him.

83
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,250
Savor his attacks thoroughly!

84
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,130
There's such a thing as going too far.

85
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,590
Gan Fall...

86
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,560
You were beaten by someone like Shura.
Haven't you learned a lesson?

87
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,730
You probably can't even wield
your spear any longer, can you?!

88
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,850
You old fool!!

89
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,260
Yet I can't withdraw!

90
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,920
Because I don't know what you
and the others are going to do!

91
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,710
Hmph! Don't be conceited!

92
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,670
Even if you knew, someone
like you wouldn't be able

93
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
to understand God's noble thoughts!

94
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,770
After them! After the Shandians!

95
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,970
What, what? What was that?!

96
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,090
I heard, "Meh." Goats?

97
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,160
They're Divine Soldiers!
If we get caught, we'll be killed!

98
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,030
What're Divine Soldiers?!

99
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,240
They're Eneru's underlings!
Hurry up and get out of here!

100
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,530
W-Wait! But where're we headed?!

101
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,830
What's that?!

102
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,110
That's Giant Jack!
Eneru's shrine is probably above there!

103
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,510
Eneru's shrine?!

104
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,990
Wyper!

105
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,800
What?!

106
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,480
I sense Wyper over there!

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,250
He's alive!

108
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,090
We can see Giant Jack!

109
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,730
Don't let them go to God's Shrine!

110
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,680
Quit pestering us!!

111
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,620
That damn snake! It keeps gettin' in my way!

112
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,150
Hey, Chopper?!

113
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,530
Hey! Why're you...?!

114
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,120
I see... He was part of the
group from the Blue Sea.

115
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,810
Hey, be careful going over there.

116
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,180
What was that?!

117
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,220
Barbed wire?!

118
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,260
So that's the ordeal...

119
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,570
Chopper! Hey, Chopper!

120
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,950
Say something! Why did you come
to a place like this alone?! Hey!

121
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,230
Such a shame...

122
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,070
They're "Iron Clouds."

123
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,130
They're light as clouds and hard as iron.

124
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,320
They're blown into shape by a milky dial.

125
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,090
Each one is connected to
some part of the ground.

126
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,050
When you step on it, it gets discharged.

127
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,750
On this field, you never know when and
where they'll be activated to strike you.

128
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,220
That animal was partially defeated by me,

129
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,810
but he also became a victim
of the ordeal on his own.

130
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,990
So do you want to get
revenge now or something?

131
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,520
No.

132
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,390
I don't really like fighting
for that sort of reason.

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,880
Oh? Isn't that something?

134
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,620
But...

135
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,660
Hm?

136
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm getting a little fired up.

137
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,310
I'm sorry. This is the
right place, right, Conis-san?

138
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,870
The seashore where they're
planning to meet up...

139
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes, Father. Nami-san told me so.

140
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,290
But what should we do?

141
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,090
I didn't expect that we'd
have to look after the ship.

142
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,470
We have to protect it at any
cost until they come back!

143
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,060
Shall we sound the horns
to scare off the enemy?!

144
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,050
Yes, Father! It'll be reassuring!

145
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,980
This will do.

146
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,290
Would you stand watch over there, Suu?

147
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,340
Nami-san, you said a promise...?

148
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,950
Luffy and the others went into
the forest for some little thing.

149
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,500
We're meeting up at the seashore in
the northwest, so I have to go there...

150
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you think they're okay?
Things are terrible in the forest right now.

151
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,180
I hope they're okay.

152
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,150
Don't worry.

153
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,750
Our crew will be fine!

154
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,740
Okay! I'll do my best to take care of you!
Please hang on, both of you!

155
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,940
Please everyone... be safe...

156
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,200
I'm sorry that the sky island is like this.

157
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,220
Head to God's Shrine!

158
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,890
Now's the time to get Eneru's head!

159
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,450
Don't let them go to God's Shrine!

160
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,040
Climb up Giant Jack!

161
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,380
Wyper! Don't use Reject anymore!

162
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,490
Divine Soldiers! Come back!
Stop the Shandians!

163
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,260
Don't challenge Eneru, Wyper!

164
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,570
We can't... We can't defeat Eneru! Never!

165
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
That's right.

166
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,660
Everyone... climb up to the Upper Ruins...

167
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,880
...and kill each other.

168
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,310
There will be five survivors.

169
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,690
God's prophecy is absolute.

170
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,840
Stop it, Wyper! I am...

171
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,160
"I am" what?! You want to say
that you're not my enemy?!

172
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,280
To us, you and Eneru are the same, Gan Fall!

173
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,080
So you won't listen, huh?!

174
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,350
You son of a bitch!

175
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,370
Burn Bazooka doesn't work...
What kind of scales does it have?!

176
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,970
I... I can't take this cave anymore!!

177
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,190
Ha! It is a dog, after all. As we
move around, I'll find an opportunity.

178
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,320
What did you just...?

179
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,600
Hmph! This is why Blue Sea
people get on my nerves.

180
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,690
This sword is also made of Iron Clouds.

181
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,920
In other words,

182
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,310
Iron Clouds are added to the
blade by a dial built in the haft,

183
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,910
so it chases the enemy
to the ends of the earth!

184
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,090
Were you able to understand that,
swordsman from the Blue Sea?

185
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,650
It's just like a whip. Yeah, I get it

186
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,840
that the White-White Sea has
a bunch of circus warriors!

187
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,430
Holy...

188
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,020
Let's fight separately.

189
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,610
It seems that it's getting a
little busy in the Upper Ruins.

190
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,440
I didn't expect that even the
Lord of the Sky would be here...

191
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,370
We'll assist you, Ohm-sama!

192
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,110
You guys...!

193
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,430
Looks like...

194
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,140
Yeah... we're the only ones left.

195
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,790
We'll help you reach Eneru, Wyper!

196
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,700
Oh, yeah! I'll dig a hole to the outside!

197
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,740
That giant snake...

198
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,010
It's laughing!

199
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,380
Hold it!

200
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,130
Quit pestering us!!

201
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,810
N-Nami?!

202
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,100
Aisa!

203
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,350
Young lady!

204
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,230
Kill them!

205
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,290
Aisa! What're you doing here?!

206
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,840
Nami! Why're you here?!

207
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,140
Ah! Zoro! Where's everyone?!

208
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,290
Wyper!

209
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,010
What're you plotting, Blue Sea person?!

210
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,880
Aisa! Get away from that woman!

211
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,340
That was close!

212
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,560
Demon! You're a demon, Wyper!!

213
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,800
Why did you two come to a place like this?!

214
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,080
Why?!

215
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,360
Because a huge...

216
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,990
...snake...

217
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,120
Ahhhh... That idiot...!

218
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,090
Aisa!!

219
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,610
Wyper!!

220
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,310
You're idiots who can't
even protect yourselves.

221
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,440
Quit worrying about others!

222
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,260
At any rate, no one will survive!

223
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,810
Racing full speed ahead as always

224
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,560
A to Z, we run through it

225
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,360
We all have worries and fall many times

226
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
But we just need to rise to the top someday

227
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,750
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

228
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

229
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,310
I never treat you "bad"

230
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,010
How many times did we fall?

231
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:55,100
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

232
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Smile! Come back to you, friends

233
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

234
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,370
Come back to you, friends

235
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

236
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,910
Come back to you, friends

237
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,050
Fence or no fence, I'm not running away.

238
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,350
Once you touch it, you'll get hurt.

239
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,890
Laki!

240
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,870
Get out of here, Wyper! Don't fight!

241
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,380
Stop it, you son of a bitch! Laki!

242
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,920
Although she's a woman, she's still
a warrior. I won't have mercy.

243
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,910
You giant snake! I have
business with your stomach!

244
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,170
On the next episode of One Piece!

245
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,050
"The Ordeal of Iron!
White Barbed Death Match!!"

246
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
