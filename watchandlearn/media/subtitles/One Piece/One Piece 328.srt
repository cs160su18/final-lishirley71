2
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,520
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,890
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,690
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,410
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,830
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,210
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,590
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,560
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,020
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,270
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,030
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,620
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,130
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,590
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,850
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,900
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,150
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,490
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,870
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,410
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,620
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,160
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,870
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,130
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,000
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,340
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,510
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,640
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,970
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,350
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,690
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,730
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,150
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,530
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,240
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,850
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,440
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,900
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,040
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,530
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,720
Find it!

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,270
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,060
The bounty hunters have left
to hunt the Straw Hat Pirates,

50
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,910
who have fallen for their trap.

51
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,320
A total bounty of 600 million Berries, eh?

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,740
I can't wait to see their Jolly Roger!

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,410
Why don't we celebrate early?

54
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,000
May our beloved Papa, Don Accino,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,870
and the Accino Family's knit
blood relations be blessed!

56
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,550
And here's to our present for Papa--

57
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,580
the heads of the Straw Hat Pirates.

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,250
Cheers!

59
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,140
"The Dream Sinking in the New World!
The Disillusioned Pirate, Puzzle"

60
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,980
The icebergs moved?!

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,880
Are you morons?

62
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,880
Freezing!

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,330
Water moves!

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,330
It's only natural for icebergs to move.

65
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,480
Perhaps that's not quite what they meant.

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,100
Right.

67
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,220
They aren't moving because of the currents.

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,030
They're moving of their own accord!

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,380
Of their own accord?

70
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,590
Hey, don't give us this crap
first thing in the morning!

71
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,770
Watch and see!

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Sanji-kun, if you please.

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
Okay!

74
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,500
Wh-What the heck?!

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,770
Once more!

76
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,800
For chunks of ice, they're bossy punks!

77
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,830
It's just a mass of ice.

78
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,580
But it definitely moved to block our path...

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,500
The iceberg itself seems normal enough.

80
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,270
There were also those
Marine ships last night.

81
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,760
It feels like something is
trying to lure us somewhere.

82
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,260
I have no idea who it is,
but they've got guts!

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,550
Let's duke it out!

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,270
But first we have to figure out
who exactly is behind this.

85
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,270
Vigaro...

86
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,370
Wait...!

87
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,620
Puzzle-san?

88
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,160
Vigaro...!

89
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,630
Vigaro...

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,620
Vigaro!

91
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,480
Ow...

92
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,570
What is it?

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
What happened?

94
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
Puzzle-san...!

95
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,810
Puzzle-san is...!

96
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,870
Ow...

97
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,430
Puzzle-san...

98
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,020
Thank goodness!

99
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,460
Thank you, Doctor!

100
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,350
You really are a great physician!

101
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,030
I-I'm not happy about getting called a
"great physician" or anything, you punk!

102
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,410
Jiro, what am I doing here?

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,460
Don't you remember, Captain?

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,850
We were attacked by some really
strong guys in the New World...

105
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,210
What the hell?!

106
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,550
Who are those guys?!

107
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,210
Put out the fire!

108
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,110
Don't drag your feet!

109
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,170
Please help me!

110
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,010
How is an attack like that even possible?!

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,620
Hurry and carry the injured!

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,730
Retreat!

113
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,560
Get us out of here as fast as possible!

114
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,300
We still weren't ready... for the New World!

115
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,990
What's gotten into you?

116
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,070
It's not like Puzzle the
Phoenix to sound defeated...

117
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm not a phoenix!

118
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,460
I'm just a whippersnapper
that got in over my head.

119
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,410
Listen to me, Puzzle.

120
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,930
We've followed you because we believe in you.

121
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,700
That's because--

122
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,560
It's no use, Captain!

123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,310
They're too fast!

124
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Puzzle, I'll buy some time!

125
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,900
Stansen, bring out the raiding dory!

126
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,360
First Officer!

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,580
Hurry!

128
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,490
R-Right!

129
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,870
Wait, Vigaro!

130
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm going with you!

131
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,290
Idiot!

132
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,410
You can't leave the ship!

133
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,620
You're the captain!

134
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,820
But...!

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,150
Puzzle, I believe in you.

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,580
You are the man who will
become the King of the Pirates!

137
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,610
Hey, Vigaro!

138
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,250
Wait!

139
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,670
Captain, here it comes again!

140
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,510
M-Meteors?!

141
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,690
Vigaro!

142
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,240
Even First Officer Vigaro didn't last more
than a few seconds up against them...

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,070
But during that brief period of time,
he managed to destroy their rudder.

144
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,620
Thanks to him, we were able to escape...

145
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,330
That's why everyone who
survived swore an oath!

146
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,840
We should be like our first officer
and protect the captain with our lives!

147
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,240
You're absolutely right, Jiro!

148
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,430
I'd be willing to lay down
my life for Puzzle-san.

149
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,840
Same here!

150
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,170
Let's protect the captain!

151
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,070
Yeah!

152
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,250
Let's do it!

153
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,260
Sounds good.

154
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,230
I'm going to the New World!

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,660
But then Stansen-san...

156
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,570
Why do you think Vigaro was willing
to sacrifice his life to protect yours?

157
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,380
Don't you dare throw your life away!

158
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,840
You're working for a group
of bounty hunters...?

159
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,940
It's true that they're incredibly strong

160
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,620
and we were a mess after the New World...

161
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,260
I can understand why we lost,

162
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,650
but then they stole our Jolly Roger...

163
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,190
our pride as the Phoenix Pirates....

164
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,310
How could he...?

165
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,610
Stansen-san is a coward!

166
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,340
But that's all coming to an end today!

167
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,540
Puzzle the Phoenix has risen once more!

168
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,350
Puzzle-san!

169
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,260
Don't push yourself!

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,650
It's okay.

171
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,950
I feel fine now...

172
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,870
Gather the whole crew up on the deck.

173
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,500
Aye, Captain!

174
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,570
The captain has regained consciousness!

175
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,170
Hey, is that true?!

176
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,980
The day we've been
dying for has finally arrived!

177
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,640
This is the revival of the Phoenix Pirates!

178
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,980
Now that damn Stansen will
get what's coming to him!

179
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,680
Puzzle-san!

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Puzzle-san!

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,500
Puzzle-san!

182
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,970
Men, I'm sorry to have put you out.

183
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,870
It was nothing!

184
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,850
Imagining today made it easy!

185
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,030
Puzzle-san, I'm glad you're okay!

186
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,920
Let's go, Chopper.

187
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,610
Uh-huh.

188
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,260
Puzzle-san!

189
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,380
Dr. Chopper!

190
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,260
Luffy-san!

191
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,680
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,470
It was nothing.

193
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,440
I only did what any doctor would do.

194
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,480
I'll be sure to pay you back someday!

195
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,190
Next time we meet will
be in the New World, huh?

196
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,630
That's right!

197
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,580
You were also headed for
the New World, weren't you?

198
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,720
Then that means we'll be
rivals from here on out!

199
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,210
I can barely wait!

200
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,460
Captain, we need to hop to
it and build up our forces

201
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,480
so we can return to the New World...

202
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,470
Captain?

203
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,930
Hey?

204
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,730
Captain?

205
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,430
Captain?

206
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,930
Puzzle-san?

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,140
We...

208
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,640
aren't going back to the New World.

209
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,110
No...

210
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,370
Stansen's decision was right.

211
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,530
We're going to continue working
for those bounty hunters.

212
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,210
No way!

213
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,680
Why?

214
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,460
Why?!

215
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,700
H-Have you lost your mind, Puzzle-san?!

216
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,510
Everyone is willing to fight to
the death, just like Vigaro-san!

217
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,680
That's right...

218
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,760
Vigaro died... all for me.

219
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,030
Puzzle, I believe in you.

220
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,440
You are the man who will
become the King of the Pirates!

221
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,690
But we have you on our side, Puzzle-san!

222
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,450
We've been waiting this whole time
for the Phoenix to rise from the ashes!

223
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,370
What happened to Puzzle the Phoenix?!

224
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,230
The Phoenix...

225
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,590
only existed
in the world of fairytales.

226
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,700
I have no right to go to the New World
when I couldn't protect my crew!

227
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,300
How could you say that, Captain...?

228
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,490
I can't accept that...

229
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,570
Our flag...

230
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,770
What about the Jolly Roger
they stole from us?!

231
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,740
We don't need a Jolly Roger anymore.

232
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,340
Damn it!

233
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,580
Have you lost all sense of pride?!

234
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,960
Hey, Luffy...!

235
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,290
Hey, wait!

236
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,780
I'd love to thank you for tending to me,

237
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,690
but I'm afraid we lost
everything in the New World.

238
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,550
Those waters...

239
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,600
The New World isn't as
forgiving as you think.

240
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,980
That's okay.

241
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,230
I'll find out when I get there.

242
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,860
Besides, we're strong!

243
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,250
That's okay.

244
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,530
I'll find out when I get there.

245
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Besides, we're strong!

246
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,090
Don't take the New World lightly, Puzzle.

247
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,640
Don't worry, Vigaro! I'm a phoenix!

248
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,770
I see.

249
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,920
Then do as you please.

250
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,330
Jiro...

251
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,650
Let's go, Chopper.

252
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,370
But...

253
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,870
He's given up on their Jolly Roger.

254
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,080
They aren't pirates anymore.

255
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,260
R... Right...

256
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,650
Goodness!

257
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,510
Luffy!

258
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,120
Chopper!

259
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,620
They'll be fine without us!

260
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,820
Guys, take care of the ship!

261
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,410
You can count on me!

262
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,170
We're going to swerve around to the right!

263
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,450
'Kay!

264
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,460
Hard a-starboard!

265
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,320
Hard a-starboard!

266
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,030
Bad move!

267
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,990
Turn us around!

268
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,890
To the left!

269
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,060
Stop!

270
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,550
The icebergs are gathering together.

271
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,520
Hey, Sanji!

272
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,950
Where do you think you're taking us?!

273
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,030
Damn it!

274
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,400
The rudder's not responding.

275
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,830
No, look over there!

276
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,500
When the waterways got blocked,
it created those whirlpools.

277
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,300
What is with these waters?!

278
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,390
Th-That's...!

279
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,330
I wanna turn that into
shaved ice and gobble it up!

280
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,940
Shaved ice?!

281
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,580
It's huge!

282
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,970
Looks good!

283
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,450
This isn't the time for that!

284
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,590
I'll be back in just a sec!

285
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,320
Gum-Gum...

286
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,070
Gatling!

287
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,080
He's a Devil Fruit power holder?

288
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,500
And...

289
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,040
It's a waste of time.

290
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,360
Battle Axe!

291
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,850
My shaved ice...!

292
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,440
The Sunny is gone!

293
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,020
This is the Arctic Path.

294
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,320
Any ship that wanders in never
sees the open ocean again.

295
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,450
There is no mistaking him!

296
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,790
That's Puzzle the Phoenix,
with a bounty of 100 million Berries.

297
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,000
Wasn't he supposed to be dead?

298
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,670
We've been had!

299
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,380
That Stansen guy tricked us.

300
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,610
Straw Hat Luffy,
a 300-million-Berry bounty, is with him,

301
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,840
bringing them to a total
of 400 million Berries.

302
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,880
This is turning into something else!

303
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,300
Let's hurry and inform Blend-sama!

304
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,320
Puzzle the Phoenix is still alive?

305
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,720
How dare the fallen pirates
deceive the Accino Family?!

306
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,520
They've got some nerve!

307
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,810
Siblings, we can add another present
to the list for our beloved Papa!

308
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,390
I'm going to check on it right quick.

309
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,490
You may handle things here!

310
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,470
Jerk!

311
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,700
How dare you take advantage of the
confusion to grab onto Nami-san?!

312
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,570
Why are you using the paddle wheel?

313
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,120
Franky, where have you been?

314
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,580
I was fully charging the cola
barrels in the energy room.

315
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,290
If my guess is right, there will definitely
come a time when we need them.

316
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,210
At any rate, if we're ever going
to get out of these crazy waters...

317
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,720
...first we've got to unravel the
puzzle behind the moving icebergs!

318
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,280
There has to be some sort of trick.

319
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,300
That doesn't mean squat to us!

320
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,020
It doesn't?!

321
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,100
It'd be a cinch for us
to get out of this place!

322
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,190
Oh, yeah!

323
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,890
We finally found you!

324
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,000
Dearies, now that you've
wandered into the Arctic Path,

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,550
you'll never get to see
the open ocean ever again.

326
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,480
Say your prayers!

327
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,120
I have to agree!

328
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,620
Don't you?

329
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,420
Don't you?

330
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,530
Don't you?

331
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,730
We always see eye-to-eye, don't we?

332
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,790
They're stifling.

333
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,570
That beautiful lady is
with such a hideous man!

334
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,380
Hey, you there!

335
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,680
I challenge you to a duel right here--

336
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,950
I'm afraid we don't have
time to play with you.

337
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:31,780
Yeah.

338
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,830
It's about time we took our leave.

339
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
You sure are dense!

340
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,590
We were just telling you
that there is no escape!

341
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,400
None at all!

342
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
In other words, it's impossible!

343
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,140
Nice!

344
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,930
That expression was nice!

345
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,910
Wasn't it?

346
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,260
Wasn't it?

347
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,550
Wasn't it?

348
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,140
We always see eye-to-eye, don't we?

349
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,600
Do it, Franky!

350
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,880
Got it!

351
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,980
Here I go!

352
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,530
Coup de...

353
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,620
...Burst!

354
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,480
Wh-What type of ship is that?!

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:24,960
Nice!

356
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,180
That's really nice!

357
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,860
What's the matter, Salchow?

358
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,170
The ship...

359
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,500
is f-flying away in the sky!

360
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,700
Do you expect me to believe that nonsense?

361
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,140
But...!

362
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,400
Hand that over!

363
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,110
Brother, he's telling you the truth.

364
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,070
The ship is flying away
right before my very eyes.

365
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,240
Papa, we've run into some trouble!

366
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,040
Why not get the flag first?

367
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,270
Way to go, Papa!

368
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,750
That's a splendid idea.

369
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,480
He said to get the flag first, my darling.

370
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,580
Sure thing, my honey!

371
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,380
Hey, Lil-chan!

372
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,670
Could you summon
that one critter for us?

373
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,350
No!

374
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,260
Eh?!

375
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,940
Er, um, I'm sorry, but you can't just--

376
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,570
Lil-chan, you'd be doing it
as a favor for me, too.

377
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,020
Plus it was an order from our beloved Papa.

378
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,250
Go, my kite, Uo!

379
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,420
A strange fish?

380
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,930
At long last, we can finally relax!

381
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,200
The ocean really is great!

382
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,300
Blue skies and white clouds!

383
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,710
The shining sun and the flapping Jolly...

384
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,320
It's gone!

385
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,620
Our Jolly Roger is gone?

386
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,530
And Zoro appears to be missing, too...

387
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,990
I can't believe they got lost again!

388
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,080
Are they stupid?!

389
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,000
Brrr!

390
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,410
It's freezing!

391
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,430
Not only are the icebergs
cold, but they keep moving!

392
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,140
I bet the others are taking it easy,
drinking tea on the ship.

393
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,920
What's that gaudy building?

394
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

395
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,190
"The Assassins Attack!
The Great Battle on Ice Begins"

396
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,050
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
