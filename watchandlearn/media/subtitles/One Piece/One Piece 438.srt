2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,650
"THANK YOU"

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,480
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,620
who has been captured by the Navy.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,750
Together with Red-nosed Buggy

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,280
and former Baroque Works
agents Mr. 3 and Bon clay,

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,970
he reached level 4 the Burning Heat Hell...

57
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,850
...but was poisoned by Magellan,
the warden of Impel Down

58
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,080
and taken into custody!

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,250
As Luffy was taken into custody
on level 5--the Freezing Hell,

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,680
Bon Clay tried his hardest
to find a way to save him!

61
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,280
No way?!

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,700
I mean, what do you mean that
you can't make an antidote!

63
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,410
A miracle?

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,420
Oh yeah! He is in Impel Down!

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,370
The queen of queers--

66
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,580
Ivan-san!

67
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,850
We better find him now!

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,830
"A Paradise in Hell!
Impel Down Level 5.5!"

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,110
T-This is no good!

70
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,760
We have no choice!
We should lock ourselves up!

71
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,460
Alright! I'll draw their attention!

72
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,530
Open it quick!

73
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,710
Dammit! Chew on this,
my special weapon--Muggy Ball!

74
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,790
Ha! How's that?!

75
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,560
What?!

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,650
I did it!

77
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,670
Did you?!

78
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,850
I did it... I broke the key!

79
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,390
What're you doing?!

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,940
It's too late!

81
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,200
Candle Shield!

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,420
That was close!

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,620
You better get into the cell now!

84
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,170
We don't need to!

85
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,290
I have an idea!

86
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,130
Stupid wolves! You can't get us now!

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,490
It's no use biting it!

88
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,790
This Candle House is as hard as iron!

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,080
Even with your big fangs, you can't break it!

90
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Let's go!

91
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,530
Oh yes!

92
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,480
1, 2! 1, 2!

93
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,970
Wow! This is nice!

94
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,570
They can't even touch us!

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,630
It's heavier than I thought!

96
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,610
I made it thicker than usual to protect us!

97
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,580
Yeah? Well, good job!

98
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,490
Even if it's a tortoise's pace,
as long as we can get to the stairs,

99
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,800
then we can get out of here!

100
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,710
That's right!

101
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,280
And as long as we're in here,
we can avoid the cold wind!

102
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,350
Alright!

103
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,230
1, 2! 1, 2!

104
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,040
Wait! Let's go back a little!

105
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,410
What's the matter?

106
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,200
Something is wrong.

107
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,540
What happened to the wolves?

108
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah, where the hell do they go?!

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,780
All of them are gone!

110
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,070
What's that noise?

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,640
T-This must be...

112
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,850
That was pretty clever of them!

113
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,210
Who the hell is this guy
all covered in blood?!

114
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,900
Earlier, I was...

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,480
We have no chance to win!

116
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,310
I'm sorry but I gotta run!

117
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,040
Straw-chan! I'm sorry!

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,180
I'm sorry that I ran!

119
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,030
How do you know this guy?

120
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130
I'm his friend!

121
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,790
Straw-chan! I'm not gonna let you die!

122
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,050
We better go now!

123
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,270
He left the keys!

124
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,610
I never thought about breaking out.

125
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,850
I gotta find Ivan-san as soon as possible!

126
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,740
Ivan-san?!

127
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,830
How should I know
where that queer went?!

128
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,030
Who the hell are you?!

129
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,830
Emporio Ivancov?

130
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,080
Oh yeah, I remember him!

131
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,090
He must be dead!

132
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,760
What are you looking at?!

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,640
Why are you looking for a missing person?!

134
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,240
How did you get out of your cell?!

135
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,490
Why don't you set me free?!

136
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,330
Do you know where the man named Ivan-san is?!

137
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,610
Hello?! Can you hear me?!

138
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,450
Hey, why don't you say something?!

139
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,160
It's no use!

140
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,870
They're all frozen in that cell!

141
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,400
I wanna know...

142
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,910
Yeah, I heard you.

143
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,700
You're looking for that fairy, Ivancov, right?

144
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,350
Do you know something?

145
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,160
Look! Do you see the forest?

146
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah.

147
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,380
There's an abandoned jailer's room in there.

148
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,070
I once saw a strange guy moving around there.

149
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,560
Really?!

150
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,360
Why don't you go and check?

151
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,080
Thank you!

152
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,430
No problem!

153
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,130
I thought that's where the wolves live.

154
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,930
Oh? Is that so?

155
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,620
People have disappeared
occasionally in Impel Down.

156
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,690
They didn't break out because
some of them could barely move.

157
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,110
They just disappeared without a trace.

158
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,610
We call it "Demoning away!"

159
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,270
We all fear these unnatural disappearances,

160
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,830
and assume that they're pulled
into the gate of hell.

161
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,130
That's why we call it "Demoning away!"

162
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,450
"The gate of hell?" "Demoning away?"

163
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,610
Yeah, right!

164
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,320
I don't think that's the reason
that Ivan-san disappeared!

165
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,070
I've never met him but he's a miracle-worker!

166
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,020
He must be able to work miracles
in a place like this, too!

167
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,730
Ivan-san is the God of all queers!

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,610
Please!

169
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,300
Save Straw-chan!

170
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,900
If antidotes won't help him...

171
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,390
...you're his only hope!

172
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,580
And I won't give up on hoping!

173
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,880
Aak! No!

174
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,330
Straw-chan!

175
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,940
What do you think you're doing to...

176
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,030
...Bon-chan?!

177
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,780
Leave Bon-chan...

178
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,080
...alone!

179
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,550
S-Straw-chan! What did you do...

180
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,630
...to them...?

181
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,470
The public execution of Ace is in...

182
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,160
...26 hours!

183
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,320
Damn!

184
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,020
Where are you?!

185
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,360
This place is too hot! It's like hell!

186
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,230
Wow! Nice! She's exactly my type!

187
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,800
Healthy, young and beautiful!

188
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,370
Wait a minute! But...

189
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,330
...where's that quick pansy prisoner
who beat all of these guards?!

190
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,350
Who are you?!

191
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,670
That doesn't matter, sweetie!

192
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,430
Why don't you come here?

193
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,280
Huh?

194
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,150
I'm all sweaty!

195
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,230
Can you help me undress?

196
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,390
Please!

197
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,810
Puff-puff!

198
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,160
Why don't you unlock this door?

199
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,730
Yeah, alright!

200
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,650
Smash!

201
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,420
Here you go!

202
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,810
Alright, how can I help you?

203
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,160
Ha ha! Do you have extra clothes?

204
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,470
I got you!

205
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,800
I can't take this!

206
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,870
That queer! I'm coming after you!

207
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,900
It's nice to be able to
lay the blame on Warden

208
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,930
but I don't like the fact he outsmarted me!

209
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,530
And I wanna become the warden!

210
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,660
I used too much poison!

211
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,490
My stomach! Oh, my stomach!

212
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Yes, the riot is completely
under control now!

213
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,230
We put all the prisoners back in their
cells and got the keys back but...

214
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,110
...I think some keys are missing.

215
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,460
What a pain in the butt!

216
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,810
You got to... mmm... find him!

217
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,400
Catch him alive now!

218
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,510
This queer must be... mmm... on this floor!

219
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,310
Yes, Madam!

220
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,630
Several hours later, Mr. 2 Bon Clay is...

221
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,310
Where... is this?

222
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,590
Oh yeah!

223
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
Straw-chan?!

224
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,430
Where did Straw-chan go?!

225
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,630
I hear people talking...

226
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,230
This is it!

227
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,610
It's so bright!

228
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,590
What?!

229
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,680
Oh! So you finally woke up, young man!

230
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,060
You've been sleeping quite
a while! Want a drink?

231
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,610
Cheers to the newcomer!

232
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,140
Cheers!

233
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
We've been watching you guys on the monitor!

234
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,450
I really enjoyed it!

235
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,710
What is this place?

236
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,780
I'll take you to your seat!
What floor did you come from?

237
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,650
We got plenty to eat! You must be hungry!

238
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,120
Wait! Where am I?! Where's Straw-chan?!

239
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,270
Do you think that you're outside the prison?!

240
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,720
Don't worry! You're still in Impel Down.

241
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,260
No way! No one's wearing
their jail clothes here!

242
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,450
And you're eating and drinking as you want!

243
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,440
Is this some kind of paradise?!

244
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,020
Oh yeah, I remember!

245
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,380
I was chased by the wolves
and Straw-chan helped me!

246
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,750
And I just passed out!

247
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,000
Then, am I dreaming?!

248
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,140
No! I think I died from the cold

249
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,150
so I'm in heaven now!

250
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,370
Did you wake up?

251
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,330
You've been sleeping like a
baby for about 10 hours now.

252
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,780
10 hours?!

253
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,800
Are you kidding me?! Who are you?!

254
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,240
My name is Inazuma.

255
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,970
You're being rude!

256
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,150
I'm the one who moved the two of you.

257
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,140
You were nearly dying of exposure!

258
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,470
What? Did you say "two?"

259
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,900
Straw-chan is here, too?

260
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,660
Where is he? Is he alright?

261
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,340
Are you people jailers?

262
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,150
What is this place?!

263
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,410
Now, now, calm down.

264
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040
He is going to tell you!

265
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,740
W-Who is He?

266
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,430
Oh! The lights are going down!

267
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,410
The shows starting!

268
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,300
Let's go to the front.

269
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,060
What is this?

270
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,230
Did you sleep alright, candy boy?

271
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,280
No, you're Mr. 2 Bon boy.

272
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,020
Who are you? Why do you know my name?!

273
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,870
Thank you for coming.

274
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,360
This is...

275
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,290
You're great! Very sexy!

276
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,020
This is...

277
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,900
Down the sewage line of Impel Down

278
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,060
and just take the route that shouldn't be there,

279
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,660
then, you'll get here!

280
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,730
It's a paradise for prisoners!

281
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,310
You've got everything here, so enjoy!

282
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,180
Drinks!

283
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,700
"Weapons!"

284
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,010
Games!

285
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,330
And most of all, we have freedom!

286
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,210
Yes, that's right! We're all free!

287
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,770
Yes! The jailers are
panicking today as usual!

288
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,640
"Prisoners have disappeared!"

289
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
"They've been pulled into hell!"

290
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,340
Just like that!

291
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,770
I'm sorry but they're all here!

292
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,430
Do you say that this is hell?!

293
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,940
Maybe you're right,
but at least it's a gay one!

294
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,610
The underground that nobody knows!

295
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,520
Welcome to...

296
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,660
...Impel Down--Level 5.5!

297
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,290
It's a secret garden for prisoners!

298
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,400
New Kama Land!

299
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,960
Heehaw!

300
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Who are these perverts?!

301
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,140
Yeah! Ivan-sama!

302
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,800
What?!

303
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,300
Ivan-sama!

304
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,080
Ivan-sama!

305
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,660
Ivan-sama?! No way!

306
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,600
He is the legendary...

307
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,150
...Queen of Kamabakka Kingdom.

308
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,860
Heehaw!

309
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,960
Emporio Ivancov?!

310
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,140
Heehaw!

311
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,430
Bon Clay implores the miracle-worker,
Iva-san, to cure Luffy's poisoning.

312
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,930
However, Iva-san's remedy is

313
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,210
a cruel procedure that will
leave Luffy battered and torn.

314
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,410
A fierce battle commences against the poison.

315
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,340
On the next episode of One Piece!

316
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,860
"Luffy's Treatment Begins!
Ivan-san's Miraculous Power!"

317
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
