2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,230
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,150
Luffy made it to the Maiden Island

61
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,610
where he was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,120
There is, however, an untold
story of the brothers...

63
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,350
...10 years ago in the East
Blue - Luffy and Ace as boys.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,430
Luffy has been left with Dadan -
the mountain bandit of Mt. Corvo

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,220
and met 2 precocious kids named Ace and Sabo.

66
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,330
"Leaving the Dadan Family for Good?!
The Kids' Hideout Has Been Built!"

67
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,730
How are you, Pochi?

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,610
Who dug a hole at the front door?!

69
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,450
It was Ace and the other
two - to catch boars.

70
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,830
This is my house! They can't just
dig a hole wherever they want!

71
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,830
Those brats!

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,250
Sabo, who gave you permission
to invade our territory?!

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,030
Your territory?! Ha! You
guys are so full of it!

74
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,760
Stop talking nonsense and bring it on!

75
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,330
Alright, get ready!

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
Ace!

77
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,390
Pay attention!

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,860
Dammit!

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,230
You little shit!

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,710
I made a dent!

81
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,660
Here comes the sheriff! Let's go!

82
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,050
Luffy, Hurry up! It's this way!

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,180
It's back!

84
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,630
Let's get a deer for dinner!

85
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,560
Yeah! I love venison! Let's go hunting!

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,770
Hey, wait!

87
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
We're home!

88
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,190
Don't come home, annoying brats!

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,030
That's for dinner.

90
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,300
Cook it now.

91
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,860
It's a mealtime!

92
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,730
Don't waste food!

93
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,300
He's gonna eat me!

94
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,410
Don't come out until you count up to 10,000!

95
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,030
Hey! Stop it!

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
You jerk!

97
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,180
Honestly!

98
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,350
Why do we have to do a major
housecleaning every night after dinner?!

99
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm gonna kick them out at any cost!

100
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,060
Now it's clean!

101
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,080
Luffy! Wait, you bastard!

102
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,410
B-Boss...

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh boy...

104
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,870
The only time I can relax
is when I'm in my futon.

105
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,550
The last training for today!

106
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,970
I'll win!

107
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,180
You'll never learn!

108
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,390
--Here we go!
--Okay!

109
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,320
Hi, fairy!

110
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,390
Damn!

111
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,020
--Luffy, are you alive?
--What a crappy floor.

112
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,060
You bastard!

113
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,270
Hey!

114
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,150
Should we go to sleep?

115
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,150
Yeah.

116
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,610
We gotta kick the brats out!

117
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,790
If nothing is done, they're gonna
take over the Dadan family!

118
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,870
First of all, it's ruining my health!

119
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,870
Easy, easy, boss.

120
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,750
They got control over us long ago!

121
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,970
Shut up! It's just I can't
look after them anymore!

122
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,010
Yes, I'm gonna kick them out!

123
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,970
Forget about the agreement with Garp!

124
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,990
Hey!

125
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,900
Garp?

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,810
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I don't
know what made me say it!

127
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,730
Excuse me. I heard that Luffy is here.

128
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
Makino!

129
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,870
Luffy!

130
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,140
You look great!

131
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,370
It's been 6 months so we came
here to see how you're doing.

132
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,960
Hey, mayor!

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,210
Don't tell Garp-san.

134
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,510
So you're really living with the bandits...

135
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,260
You got a problem?

136
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,090
Yes, a big one! You're a bandit
- don't give me attitude!

137
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,430
What?! People from the
Windmill Village are all annoying?!

138
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,600
I have some presents for you!

139
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,850
I assume that Garp-san wouldn't
think about these things...

140
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,400
Here it is! New clothes!

141
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,610
Oh, great!

142
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm glad that you like them.

143
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,780
I'll adjust the length
so... I need you guys, too.

144
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,700
Okay?

145
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,740
Oh, hey!

146
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,200
You, too.

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,420
I heard that Ace-kun was mischievous

148
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,630
but you seem like a good boy.

149
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,800
N-No, I'm not...

150
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,720
--He's so shy!
--You're blushing, Ace!

151
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,150
--You jerks!
--Oh hey, you can't move!

152
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,310
I'll show you later.

153
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,320
I hope you like it!

154
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,680
Yummy!

155
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,040
Meals should be good on the ship.

156
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,620
I'm gonna get the best cook first
thing when I go out to sea!

157
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,530
I'm gonna become a pirate before
you do so just forget it.

158
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,670
That's not fair! I'm gonna
become a pirate first!

159
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,720
You're still saying a crap like that?!

160
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,440
Can't you both understand that
you must become Navy soldiers?!

161
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,150
--Dadan!
--Yes, Garp-san...

162
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,780
Why should I get hit, too?

163
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,910
You're not educating the brats well!

164
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,040
He's Garp? He's Ace and Luffy's grandfather?

165
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,750
Squirt, you mentioned about
going out to sea, too...

166
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,210
He's not a "Squirt" - he's Sabo!

167
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,630
We exchanged a cup of sake and
pledged to become pirates!

168
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,090
He has such a big mouth...

169
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,750
Oh, that means now there are 3 fools

170
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,810
who want me to give them a real workout!

171
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,270
You can't get away!

172
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,240
Oh boy...

173
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,150
You must be happy, Luffy.
You have 2 older brothers now.

174
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,660
Wait!

175
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,780
Take this!

176
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,120
Chest!

177
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,990
Here, here, here!

178
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,370
This old man is like a monster!

179
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,920
That's it for today! I'm
gonna be harsher tomorrow!

180
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,300
You can't drop dead yet!

181
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,530
If nothing is done, the old
man will kill us tomorrow.

182
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,560
Even if we survive,

183
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,700
he'll keep doing it until
we give up our dream!

184
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,570
I don't wanna die!

185
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,330
We only have one choice.

186
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,700
It's time to make up our minds, brothers!

187
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,550
"We will stand on our feet."

188
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,520
What should we do about this?

189
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,440
How smart-alecky of them.

190
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,950
How could you not care?! They're
infamous even downtown!

191
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,500
Anyone will try to kill them on sight
if they aren't sheltered by us!

192
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,320
My vacation is over!

193
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,580
You gotta shape them into full-fledged
Navy men by the time I come back!

194
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,190
--Are you gonna leave everything to me again?!
--Huh?

195
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,010
Take care!

196
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Take care!

197
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,430
How can a bandit raise a Navy soldier?!

198
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,310
That geezer doesn't know what he's saying!

199
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,150
Easy, easy, boss.

200
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,530
So you are worrying about
those kids after all.

201
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,410
Who cares?! Come to think
of it, this is good for us.

202
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,620
They left voluntarily! Oh, I'm glad!

203
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,930
We got away successfully!

204
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,420
They're not coming - Dadan and the others.

205
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,680
It's true that  "the devil's
children have the devil's luck"!

206
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,390
He's the devil's son!

207
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,510
I can tell that she feels happy now
because her troubles have gone away!

208
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,610
Oh no! It's pouring!

209
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,450
Let's stay here and hide from the rain.

210
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,210
This is exciting!

211
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,440
I've changed my mind. I don't
wanna get beaten by Garp

212
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,180
Go and look for the stupid brats already!

213
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,590
Yes, ma'am!

214
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,000
Guys!

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,400
Ace! Sabo!

216
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,700
Luffy!

217
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,160
Look at this!

218
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,470
What is it?

219
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,410
I designed our hideout. We can't
sleep outdoors forever, right?

220
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,330
So we gotta build a hideout right here!

221
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,960
A hideout... That's cool!

222
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,590
What about materials?

223
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,800
We've got tons you-know-where.

224
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,450
Awesome! Looks exactly like the design!

225
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,210
Great work if I say so myself!

226
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,050
What's wrong, Ace?

227
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,880
This is a hideout so we
gotta set up some traps!

228
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,710
Okay, I'll think about it!

229
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,980
Yeah!

230
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,880
We have a view of the Gray Terminal,

231
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,390
the Windmill Village and
the water of the East Blue!

232
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,390
It's not so uncommon, is it?

233
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,440
It's nice to see them from here!

234
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,110
You're right! It's different!

235
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,880
Luffy, there's a tailwind! Set the sails!

236
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,890
Okay!

237
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,930
Advance to the treasure!

238
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,810
An enemy off the bow and starboard side!

239
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,360
It's Bluejam's ship! Prepare for action!

240
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,280
They've started shooting!
Take evasive action!

241
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,390
Luffy, hard aport!

242
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,410
Yeah, I got it!

243
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,500
No! You have to say "steady"
at times like this!

244
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh, that's right.

245
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,130
Luffy, hard aport!

246
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,340
Hard aport! Steady!

247
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,430
Let's fight hand-to-hand! Lay aboard!

248
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,220
Wait for them to come aboard!

249
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,550
I got it!

250
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,480
Don't cry, Luffy!

251
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,580
Okay!

252
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,670
We won!

253
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,240
Yeah!

254
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,040
That'll teach you!

255
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,420
This is nice!

256
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah, it's great!

257
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,340
This is our hideout!

258
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,510
Here they are!

259
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,720
--Can't you find them yet?!
--I'm sorry!

260
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,800
We talked to people who saw them at
the Gray Terminal or in the jungle

261
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,730
but we couldn't find them!

262
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,270
It's been 2 weeks!

263
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,320
Maybe they were eaten by the
big tiger in the jungle!

264
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,190
--Boss!
--W-We found them!

265
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,530
Really?!

266
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,450
They built a hideout in the
huge tree deep in the jungle!

267
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,160
We can take you there!

268
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,450
I see!

269
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,060
--I'm happy for you, boss!
--You were worrying so much!

270
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,740
Oh crap! Are they still alive?

271
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,380
I can't believe that those
brats are so tenacious!

272
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,510
W-What?

273
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,470
Don't just stand around, guys!
Go get something for dinner!

274
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,180
Yes, ma'am!

275
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,780
Ace... Sabo... Wait for me...

276
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,520
When they're sleeping, they
look like ordinary kids.

277
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,380
Oh no, don't catch cold.

278
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,010
A trap just went off!

279
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,060
Someone tried to invade already?!

280
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,240
Oh? Maybe it was just a glitch.

281
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,480
Well, we made it in hurry so it could happen.

282
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,690
Ace...

283
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,150
Ouch...

284
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,160
Damn!

285
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,370
I'll never worry about them again!!

286
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,300
When the boys are attacked by a huge
bear, a certain old man saves them.

287
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,950
The man tells them

288
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,640
that he once fought Gold Roger.

289
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,160
Luffy is thrilled to hear a story

290
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,270
about the Pirate King that
he's never heard before!

291
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

292
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,980
"Luffy Becoming an Apprentice?! A Man Who
Fought Against the King of the Pirates!"

293
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
