2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,190
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,780
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,250
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,430
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,680
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
So let's go

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,890
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,230
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,480
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,040
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,420
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,190
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,450
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,120
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
saa yukou

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
So let's go

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,020
Without stopping

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,200
Without giving up to the flow of time

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,920
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,300
To the future I believe in...

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,430
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

54
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,740
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,380
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,220
This is exciting!

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,810
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

59
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,540
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

61
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,100
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

62
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,310
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ
to rescue his brother, Ace,

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,460
who is waiting to be executed.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,090
No way!

65
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,250
I think he'll appear from
where we least expect.

66
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,040
Maybe we got the wrong lineup.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,050
I see a shadow in the bay!

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I get it now!

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,820
They got all their ships...

70
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,520
...coated and approached from underwater!

71
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,830
Here comes Moby Dick!

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,540
"The Beginning of the War!
Ace and Whitebeard's Past!"

73
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,580
No way!

74
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,010
There's more?

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,730
Th-There are 3 more Whitebeard Pirates ships!

76
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,830
They've infiltrated the bay!

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,080
Th-That's the...

78
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,610
...1st division commander--Marco!

79
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,470
14 commanders--

80
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,600
they're all here!

81
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,440
It's been awhile, Sengoku.

82
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,440
Whitebeard.

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,350
You better tell me that my beloved son...

84
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,230
...is all right.

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,880
I can't believe that
we let them get this close!

86
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,930
We made it through the gate but...

87
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,490
...what I'm concerned about is
whether your father is here or not.

88
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,300
"Your?"

89
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,480
I don't think that Dragon
would let them kill his own son...

90
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,470
Oh, my dad and Ace's are not the same.

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,680
My dad is Dragon

92
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,700
but Ace's dad is Gold Roger.

93
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,540
He got a great father but he never met him.

94
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,330
He'd get mad every time I mentioned it.

95
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,590
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

96
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,310
Give me a second, Ace.

97
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,620
Pops!

98
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Wh-What is that?!

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
He cracked the air?

100
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,280
Where's that explosion coming from?!

101
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,850
No good! The water surface is too high!

102
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,390
A seaquake! He's distorting the sea!

103
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,650
The other side, too!

104
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,990
This is the power of Whitebeard!

105
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm heading out first!

106
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,720
Take care, Ace!

107
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,420
Yeah. See you, Luffy!

108
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,320
Uh-huh!

109
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,140
I'll be a lot stronger when
I leave here in 3 years!

110
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,350
You bet!

111
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,090
Ace!

112
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,430
We'll show them how it's done!

113
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,340
That bastard! He became a pirate!

114
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,420
It's a pirate ship! I never seen their flag!

115
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,050
This is a pirate whose become
very powerful rapidly recently.

116
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,530
"D?" Where is he from?

117
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,180
We can't quite figure that out

118
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,360
but even as a rookie,
he has the power of Logia.

119
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,060
Such a dashing young man in the Grand Line.

120
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,730
He refused the offer to join the Warlords.

121
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,920
How long have they been at this?

122
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,210
They're still young.

123
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,460
They shouldn't rush.

124
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,790
Are you serious, Captain?!

125
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,420
I have to see him...

126
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,510
..."Red-Haired" Shanks.

127
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,050
Spade Pirates?

128
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,930
The infamous super rookie
came to say hello to me?

129
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,640
It's not what you're thinking.

130
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,340
My brother was always talking
about you as his lifesaver

131
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,600
so I came to say thank you.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,770
You're Luffy's brother?

133
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,520
I didn't know that he had a brother.

134
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,540
Great, I'm glad to meet you!

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,470
Tell me all about yourself!

136
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,630
Let's have a banquet!

137
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,550
So he's still talking about
becoming the King of the pirates?

138
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,580
I guess that's his favorite phrase.

139
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,220
I feel sorry for him because...

140
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,210
I'm the one who'll become the next King.

141
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,710
Yeah? You think?

142
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,640
First, I'll let the whole world
know the power I have.

143
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,310
Oh? How'll you do that?

144
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,230
By beating the strongest man in this world!

145
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,130
You mean Whitebeard?

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,360
Hey, big guy, I wanna see the
guy who goes by Whitebeard.

147
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,500
I cannot introduce a sharp
young man like you to the old man!

148
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,640
Captain, that's Jimbei!

149
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,830
Oh, the Warlord?

150
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,930
Then I'd gain prestige if I beat him.

151
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm not on the crew of the Whitebeard Pirates

152
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,290
but I owe him, so I'll fight you!

153
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,060
It's been 5 days since they started fighting.

154
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,020
They're both gonna die!

155
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,720
Ace!

156
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,510
What is that?!

157
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,090
Which one of you wants to kill me?

158
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm gonna fight you as you wish.

159
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,690
Whitebeard Pirates!

160
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,380
I'm gonna fight you people single-handedly.

161
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,120
Guys!

162
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,780
Flame Fence!

163
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,480
Captain!

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,490
Captain Ace, what are you doing?!

165
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,100
Run, guys!

166
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,910
Captain!

167
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,380
What's the matter?
Are you backing away after all?

168
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,270
Let my crew get way. Instead...

169
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,440
...I'm staying!

170
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,850
You snot-nosed brat!

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,810
How cheeky you are!

172
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,070
So this is the guy who contended
for supremacy with him.

173
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,260
I won't...

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Still some fight left in you?

175
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,110
You are too valuable to let die now, boy.

176
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,160
If you still wanna run wild,

177
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,580
run as wild as you want
on the sea under my name.

178
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,380
Become my son!

179
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Screw you!

180
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,330
Hey!

181
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,260
I'm the 4th division commander.

182
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,210
My name is Thatch.

183
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,980
If you're gonna join us,

184
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,430
we should become friends!

185
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
Shut up!

186
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,230
So you're grumpy when you wake up?

187
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,190
Oh yeah, you wanna know what
happened after you passed out?

188
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,230
Your crew came to get you back

189
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,760
so we beat the hell out of them.

190
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,760
But they're not dead.
They're on this ship, too.

191
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,790
Don't you have to put
me in cuffs or shackles?

192
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,970
Shackles? We don't need them!

193
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,720
Hey! What are you doing?!

194
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,780
Do you know what time it is?

195
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,490
Guys, he fell overboard!

196
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,810
He can't swim.

197
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,550
Somebody, help him.

198
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,860
He's been at it every day.

199
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,480
How gutsy he is.

200
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,510
Must be more than 100 times now?

201
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,820
I guess.

202
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,700
Why...

203
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,530
...do you people call him Pops?

204
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,610
Because he calls us "sons."

205
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,260
We are all hated by the world.

206
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,560
So it makes us happy.

207
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,330
I know it's just a word.

208
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,870
But it still makes us happy.

209
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,000
Are you gonna keep doing this
after your life has been saved?

210
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,750
You got to make up your mind.

211
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,710
You're not capable of killing him.

212
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,520
It's either get off of this ship
and start over again...

213
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,700
...or stay here and...

214
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,640
...wear the Whitebeard logo on your back!

215
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,850
Are you Doma?

216
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,470
Ace did it again!

217
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,490
He made Doma and his crew
surrender  by himself!

218
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,980
You want me to command 2nd division?

219
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,050
It's been a vacant post for a
long time. If you took it...

220
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,320
...Nobody would complain.

221
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,210
You're one of the originals, right?
Don't you mind it at all?

222
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,090
I'm okay, don't worry.

223
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,130
I've got no such ambition.

224
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,470
Do it for us! Commander Ace!

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,080
Pops, you got a minute?

226
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,500
Well, that was surprising.

227
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,220
I didn't know that.

228
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,390
Your character is nothing like Roger's.

229
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,390
He was your enemy, right?
Don't you wanna kick me out?

230
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,820
You said that it's important
but it's such a small matter.

231
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,150
No matter who your father is,
we are all children of the sea.

232
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,740
Ace will be our 2nd division commander!

233
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,590
You're a star, don't look dazed. Here!

234
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,700
Here!

235
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,580
Hey, the food's not leaving so don't rush.

236
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,880
And you're the star of this banquet so...

237
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,620
He falls asleep!

238
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,260
Whitebeard got a powerful newbie again.

239
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,640
I heard that he's insanely strong!

240
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,750
2nd division come to cover us!

241
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,920
Ace!

242
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,100
Thatch, you okay?

243
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,110
Yeah. Thank you!

244
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,440
Your bounty will rise again!

245
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,500
Maybe.

246
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,920
Ace, I found something interesting.

247
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,660
Oh, is it a devil fruit?

248
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,300
I don't know what fruit it is yet.

249
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,810
Come on, Ace, just calm down!

250
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,920
Pops said that this is an exception.

251
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,520
You don't have to go after Teech!

252
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,610
Let me go! I am his commander!

253
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,040
If I don't do anything about it,
Thatch's spirit can't rest!

254
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,820
Ace.

255
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,200
It's okay. This is an exception.

256
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,460
I have a bad feeling about this.

257
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,010
He killed his crewmate and ran away!

258
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,800
He had been beholden to you for decades

259
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,180
and then he threw dirt in your face!

260
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,620
And above all, he disgraced my father's name

261
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,030
and I can't allow that.

262
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,780
I'll take care of this!

263
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,870
Hey, wait! Come back, Ace!

264
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,460
Is it over?

265
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,050
What caused that quake?

266
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,990
Pops.

267
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,170
Everybody.

268
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,260
I ignored your advice and took off!

269
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,730
Why didn't you just give up on me?!

270
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,950
I'm the one who caused all of this!

271
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,700
No.

272
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,110
I'm the one who told you to go.

273
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,040
Son.

274
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,160
All of the cast has assembled.

275
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,270
Whitebeard's tremendous
power brings a huge tsunami

276
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,390
that threatens to swallow up

277
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,400
all the brave men of Marineford, as
well as the peace and justice there.

278
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,650
A battle crossing generations begins at last!

279
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

280
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,890
"The Force That Could Destroy the World!
The Power of the Tremor-Tremor Fruit!"

281
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
