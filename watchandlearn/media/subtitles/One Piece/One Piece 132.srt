00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,810
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,460
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,360
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,340
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,970
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,250
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,400
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,450
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,500
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,430
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,730
1,867... 1,868...

20
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,710
1,869...

21
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,010
I got one!

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
Look!

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,600
Amazing!

24
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,520
Ahh! I've got something, too!

25
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,090
This is big! This could be
the guardian fish for this area!

26
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,240
Really?!

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,530
That's amazing!

28
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,700
All right!

29
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,510
Guardian fish...?

30
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,960
We can't eat that at all...

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,300
Ahh! Shut up!

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,590
You haven't even caught
a single fish yet! Don't complain!

33
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,260
Okay then. Just watch.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm gonna catch a big one!

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,650
Can you catch any?

36
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,920
I'm sure I will somehow...

37
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,690
Nami-san!

38
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,320
I brought you a tropical juice
that's great for your beauty

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,940
and makes your skin smooth!

40
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,780
Thanks!

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,970
That's not fair!

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,470
I want some, too!

43
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,790
Smooth skin!

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,910
Hey...

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,750
what do you want smooth skin for?

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,220
To get cuter!

47
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,350
The wind's fine. The current is fine, too.

48
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,880
It looks like we won't
have any problems today.

49
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,810
Something's taken the bait!

50
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,990
What the heck is this?

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,980
It's huge!

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,150
Hey, Luffy! What'd you catch?!

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,590
"Uprising of the Navigator!
For the Unyielding Dream!"

54
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,010
What a huge turban shell!

55
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,660
Hey, it's not actually a turban shell.

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,810
What're we gonna do with it?!

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,280
I wonder if this is edible...

58
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,750
You wanna eat it?!

59
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,420
Maybe cook it in its shell?

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,760
Hey, you too?!

61
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,570
Ahh... Boy, I thought I'd die!

62
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,320
Hi, everyone.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,280
Who... are you...?

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,480
Oh... Pardon me for not
introducing myself sooner.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,880
With a single call, I'll cordially
deliver products to your town.

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,040
I'm Rice Rice from
Transponder Snail Mail-Order.

67
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,360
Very nice to meet you.

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,300
Transponder Snail Mail-Order? What's that?

69
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,930
Well, I was in the process of
making a delivery with the Escar,

70
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,630
but I got caught in a heavy storm

71
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,320
and got shipwrecked with the
waves throwing me to and fro.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,280
--I see...
--You must've been shaken up.

73
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,330
Shaken and stirred.

74
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,980
Just kidding. You're quite clever, Miss!

75
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,440
Here, drink some water.

76
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,450
Thank you for saving me.

77
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,940
This isn't much,
but as a token of my gratitude,

78
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,340
I'll give you these catalogues.

79
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,920
With a single call, I'll deliver
the products to you.

80
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,850
Oh, that's convenient.

81
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,630
So you'll deliver even
when we're on the sea?

82
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,580
That, I can't.

83
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,040
Oh... really...

84
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,210
Yes...

85
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,010
Our motto is safe, reliable and cheap.

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,840
--And our mission is...
--It's quite roomy inside.

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Our company is, believe it or not...

88
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,810
--Ahh! What're you guys doing?!
--Wh-What's this?!

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,220
Okay! This is what I'm going
to introduce to you today.

90
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,390
The Buru Buru Blade, which is
familiar to people by now.

91
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,860
The Buru Buru Blade is our
company's top product.

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,760
And today, I'll introduce
you to this new model!

93
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm sure that many of you are already
using the old Buru Buru Blade.

94
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,890
But the old model didn't, well,
let you change the weight load,

95
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,270
which was bad!

96
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,140
It was fine for fathers,

97
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,650
but many wanted small
children to be able to use it.

98
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,680
I don't know what it is, but it looks fun!

99
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:55,120
So, this new model lets you
keep a certain rhythm and...

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,650
This is fun!

101
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,820
You know all about this one, right?!
This is the Abu Abu Slider.

102
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,460
Our company's No. 1 product!

103
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,110
A new model has been
released! Give this a try!

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,800
How is "top" different from "No. 1"?

105
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,070
Who knows?

106
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,170
And, this is our best-selling
product! The "Golden Fish"!

107
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,250
This is recommended for people
who don't exercise much these days.

108
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,300
I'll offer these great weight loss
products together as a set!

109
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,150
And, today only, I'll also add

110
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,550
20 bottles of plenty sweet Mero Mero
Juice made in the West Blue,

111
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,980
a 26-volume encyclopedia set
that will definitely be useful,

112
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,590
and a pair of binoculars that are
convenient for various things!

113
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,320
How much do you think all this would cost?!

114
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,190
A pretty penny, to be sure!

115
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,560
Just leave it to me!

116
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,770
Today only, I present this as a token
of my gratitude for saving my life!

117
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,150
Are you gonna give them to us?!

118
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,890
Just take them, you thieves!

119
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,870
How about 23,800 Berries?!

120
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,370
So you're selling them...!

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,580
I want them!

122
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,230
You wanna buy them?!

123
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,040
Oh! You carry kitchen knives, too?!

124
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,340
Yes! You're talking about this, right?

125
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,260
This is one of the high-quality items
produced individually and carefully

126
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,060
by a craftsman in High Mountain.

127
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,700
Look at this elasticity.

128
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,550
And its excellent sharpness will last forever.

129
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,500
A dozen table knives,

130
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,070
a pair of all-purpose kitchen
scissors that can cut anything,

131
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,940
a paring knife, and an electric
whetstone! I'll add all these!

132
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,610
If you act now, it's 2,980 Berries!

133
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,690
For you, Miss, here is a Smooth Skin Soap!

134
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,530
It can make your skin as smooth as an egg!

135
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,730
I see... You do have everything.

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes.

137
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,950
From mineral water to cannonballs,
there's nothing we don't carry.

138
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,320
You have living things, too?

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,900
Well, we don't.

140
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,030
What? You don't?

141
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,470
We don't have what we don't carry, so...

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,670
Say, do you have paper?

143
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,000
Huh? Paper?

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,400
That's right. Strong paper
that's big and hard to tear,

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,210
so that it'll take more than a
small sea breeze to get damaged.

146
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,640
Then, please leave it to me.

147
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,140
Transponder Snail Mail-Order
presents with confidence

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,010
the best paper, A-Thousand-Year Paper!

149
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,100
A-Thousand-Year Paper?!

150
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,750
A-Thousand-Year Paper is manufactured
by using the A-Thousand-Year Tree

151
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,750
that naturally grows on Eight-Nine Island.

152
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,070
This paper keeps away bugs,
and it's said that it won't fade

153
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,820
for at least a thousand years,
even if it's kept exposed to the sun.

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,540
It's the best for writing family
trees or drawing treasure maps.

155
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,100
Paper airplanes, too?

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,890
Huh...?

157
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,030
That would be a waste...

158
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,950
So how much is it?

159
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,830
You're gonna buy it?!

160
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,500
Of course!

161
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,830
I caught her purchasing desire!

162
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,880
I take it she's the type that price is
no object once she decides to buy.

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,490
Then, I'll just stir up her urge to buy as
much as possible and jack up the price.

164
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,930
Even if you're interested...

165
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,870
it's a valuable item in short supply...

166
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,220
Even if you order now,

167
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,770
I don't know if it'll be available
in five years... or ten...

168
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,920
But isn't there some way
you could sell it to me?

169
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,750
I'll pay any price.

170
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,740
What?!

171
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,840
The Nami who would rather
count money than eat her meals...

172
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,340
The Nami who is a money monger...

173
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,480
...will pay any price?!

174
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
You guys're going too far...

175
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,580
Okay, then... If you insist that much...

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,100
A ream of 1,000 A-Thousand-Year Papers

177
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,870
normally costs 60 million Berries,

178
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,850
but how about a special price of 48 million?

179
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,550
48 million Berries...!

180
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,230
Does that mean that it costs
48,000 Berries a sheet?!

181
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,920
Can't you drop the price a little more?

182
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,610
Well then, I'll make it a lot cheaper...

183
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,430
How about 47.5 million Berries?

184
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,670
2 million Berries!

185
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,240
4.8 million Berries!

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,250
This sounds fishy...

187
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,200
Can't you go cheaper?

188
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,470
We'll buy it!

189
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,440
Sanji-kun...

190
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,150
You have the money?

191
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,910
Nope!

192
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,840
But if we hand him over to the Navy,
we'll have that and change.

193
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,590
What?!

194
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,830
Sorry, Luffy. This is for Nami-san.

195
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,050
Wait a sec!

196
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,680
Luffy...?

197
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,070
Ahh!

198
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,270
Luffy... You mean... that Monkey D. Luffy?

199
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,530
Yeah, that's me.

200
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,980
Sanji! Whatever, just untie me.

201
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,180
No, I can't.

202
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,910
Th-Th-That odious pirate with
a 100 million-Berry bounty...

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,560
That Monkey D. Luffy...?

204
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,380
Come to think of it... that's a pirate flag!

205
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,500
I can't believe I missed
such important details!

206
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,890
I said untie me!

207
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,890
No!

208
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Uhm...!

209
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,500
I just remembered that I have
an important appointment.

210
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,470
Goodbye!

211
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,290
Thanks for everything!

212
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,930
Hey, you forgot something...!

213
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,220
What's with him?

214
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,910
Maybe he was scared of you...

215
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,170
Wanted man, Monkey D. Luffy.

216
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,740
Really...?

217
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,760
Listen. I'm going to work now,
so don't interrupt me, okay?

218
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,030
What do you mean "work"?

219
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,800
It's a secret.

220
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
That's not cute, you know...

221
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,730
Leave it to me!

222
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,560
I won't let anyone near you
until you're done with the work.

223
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,220
But... what if the wind direction
suddenly changes or something?

224
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,170
Don't worry. Those clouds...

225
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,740
If they don't move,

226
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,140
we'll have a fine day today
and there'll be no problem.

227
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
Come get me only when something
changes with those clouds.

228
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,150
Let's see...

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
Things have been hectic

230
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,040
and I haven't had free time since
we entered the Grand Line, but...

231
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,490
Little Garden...

232
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,450
Drum Island...

233
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,520
Alabasta...

234
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,390
I've written down all
the routes that we took.

235
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,840
I've stolen... no, obtained maps of the
surrounding areas from towns as well.

236
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,780
I'll draw... my own world map...

237
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,170
my dream since childhood...!

238
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,560
Guys!

239
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,620
We'll make the deck spick-and-span
while Nami-san's working.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,210
Okay!

241
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,580
Do your best!

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,170
You're gonna do it, too!

243
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,620
--You traitor!
--No fair!

244
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,640
--That's right!
--Then what about that woman?

245
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,430
Don't be ridiculous! She's a lady!

246
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,610
How stupid! It doesn't matter
if it's a man or woman...

247
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,380
Just help us, Moss-Head monster!

248
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,520
Ha ha, very funny,
Love-Love Machine goblin.

249
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,940
Just help us, or I'll beat
you up, you bastard.

250
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,590
Go ahead. You think you
can beat the monster?

251
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,010
You say that because you
don't know my goblin power.

252
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,110
Oh, really...

253
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,220
I'll cut you down!

254
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,460
Want me to gut you?!

255
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,220
I'll cut you into pieces!

256
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,470
Go! Go! Fight! Fight!

257
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,120
S-Stop it, both of you...

258
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,830
Usopp! Don't just stand there and
watch. Let's stop them already..

259
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,220
Don't be ridiculous!
Don't underestimate me!

260
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,810
You know there's no way I can stop them.

261
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,690
Oh, yeah...

262
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,660
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?!

263
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,570
Mellorine...

264
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,560
J-Just one hit...

265
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,120
For Pete's sake...

266
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,750
Hey, Bellemere-san...

267
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,920
Bellemere-san!

268
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,930
Bellemere-san...

269
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,630
Hm?

270
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,850
Say, where does the wind come from?

271
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,360
From the sea.

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,310
Sea?

273
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,750
That's right. The wind born on the sea

274
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,270
brings blessings by blowing
on Cocoyashi Village.

275
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,310
Not just wind. The rain, clouds, rainbows...

276
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,740
Everything comes from the sea.

277
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
I see... Say...

278
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,740
then where does the sea come from?

279
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,980
--What?!
--Nami.

280
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,530
Don't give Bellemere-san such a hard time.

281
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,690
But... Nojiko...

282
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,160
Nami, you really are a curious girl.

283
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,420
Nami...!

284
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,510
Nami!

285
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,650
I heard you did it again!

286
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,020
The lady at the bookshop
stormed into the house in a rage.

287
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,280
Now, let's go home. The dinner is ready.

288
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,520
Say, Bellemere-san...

289
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,530
What's beyond that sea?

290
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,200
Who knows?

291
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,240
I don't know what
lies beyond the Grand Line.

292
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,940
Even though you were a marine?

293
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,990
I was, but the sea is too big.

294
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,760
I wanna see... what's beyond the sea...

295
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,780
Nami...

296
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,960
I wonder if I can go beyond that sea...

297
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,350
You're a strong child.

298
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,930
If you really want, you can
go anywhere you want.

299
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,490
Then I've decided!

300
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm gonna use my navigation skills
to travel to all the world's oceans

301
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,500
and make a world map of everything I see.

302
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,710
I sure will...!

303
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,850
That's right. I definitely will... some day...

304
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,290
I will complete my own world map.

305
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,490
Hey, Luffy!

306
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,320
Watch!

307
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,610
Whoopie!

308
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,830
Amazing!

309
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,810
--Amazing! Amazing!
--Right?

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Geez...!

311
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,080
Ah...

312
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,820
You've been working hard.
Are you done?

313
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,960
No... But what is this?

314
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,420
Hey, what're you guys doing?

315
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,890
Cleaning.

316
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,130
This is pretty fun. Wanna do it, too, Nami?

317
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,630
What's going on? It's noisy.

318
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,560
What?! The Smooth Skin Soap?

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,390
Hey, it's dangerous.

320
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,000
It's okay! No problem!

321
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,280
Luffy!

322
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,330
That idiot!

323
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,700
Gum-Gum...!

324
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,200
Bungee... Jump!

325
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,740
Move away!

326
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,960
Watch out, Nami-san!

327
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,080
Are you okay, Nami-san?

328
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,970
Ah!

329
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,960
Ow, ow, ow...

330
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,030
Ahh! My map...

331
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,800
Oh, you were drawing a map?

332
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,170
What? Map?

333
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,270
So that's what your "work" was...

334
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,860
That's right.

335
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,130
It's the only map in the world
that recorded our journey

336
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,430
after entering the Grand Line...

337
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,230
And yet...!

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
My dream is to complete
my own world map!

339
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,200
Leave!

340
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,730
But...

341
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,710
Just leave...

342
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,370
Nami...!

343
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,620
What?!

344
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,860
I'm sorry...

345
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,010
If "sorry" were enough,
there'd be no need for the Navy!

346
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,370
Now, leave already.

347
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,380
If you don't, you'll be fined 100,000 Berries!

348
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,640
It's your fault.

349
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
Why's that?!

350
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,560
--Well, I think so, too.
--I think so, too.
--Seriously, those guys

351
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,440
--What?! You, too?!
--Now, Luffy, cheer up.
--always get in my way...

352
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,810
Hmm...

353
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,370
Hm? Smells like rain...

354
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,640
There's a problem! Luffy! Luffy!

355
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,520
There's a problem! The clouds...!

356
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,960
Spiders have ten legs.

357
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,980
No, they have eight.

358
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,620
Hey, that doesn't matter! Wake up!

359
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,320
--Centipedes have 100 legs...
--Usopp! Sanji!

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,780
Wake up! Zoro!

361
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,460
Someone!

362
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,900
There's a problem!

363
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,450
Nami...!

364
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,460
You'll be fined 100,000 Berries!

365
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,930
Wh... What should I do...?

366
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,260
Done!

367
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
If I do say so myself, this is perfect!

368
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,500
Am I a genius or what?

369
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,010
What?

370
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,970
Hey, what happened?!

371
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,940
Nami!

372
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,020
Hey! What were you doing?!

373
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,020
Why didn't you tell me
before it got this bad?!

374
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,250
Because... you said we'd
be fined 100,000 Berries...

375
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,290
You dummy...

376
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,050
Hey, you guys! How long are
you gonna keep sleeping?!

377
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
Ahh! What the heck is this?!

378
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,010
--It's a tornado! It's a tornado!
--It's obvious!

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,750
Luffy! Zoro! Fold the sails!

380
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,470
Okay!

381
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,060
Usopp! Chopper! Secure the
stuff on the deck using ropes!

382
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,930
Got it!

383
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,880
Sanji-kun! Turn to starboard!

384
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,140
Umph!

385
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,520
Point the bow of the ship
away from the tornado,

386
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,870
or we're gonna get swallowed!

387
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,570
Okay!

388
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,780
Hey, hey...

389
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,730
Listen!

390
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,340
If my precious map gets washed
away by waves or something,

391
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
you'll all pay...

392
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,910
dearly.

393
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,920
She really is scary...

394
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
The atmospheric pressure has risen
and the rain has stopped, too.

395
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,940
Thanks for your work. You can rest now!

396
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,260
Okay!

397
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,040
Well then, I'll go back to work,
so watch the clouds again.

398
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,180
You're not done yet?!

399
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,110
Of course not!

400
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,320
My goal is to draw up the world map.

401
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,110
I've just finished the first one.

402
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,910
The real work starts from here.

403
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,370
She's really going at it...

404
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,370
I like Nami-san that way, too!

405
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,240
I wonder if there'll be a
100,000-Berry fine again...

406
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,330
Probably...

407
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,540
You've been reading all this time?

408
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,750
Now, unfurl the sails!

409
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,560
Full speed ahead!

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,310
Yeah!

411
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,720
So, I'll leave the rest to you.

412
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,200
Hey...

413
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,410
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

414
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:33,330
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

415
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:39,590
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

416
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,010
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

417
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:51,270
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

418
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,690
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

419
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,420
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

420
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,200
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

421
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,460
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

422
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,450
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

423
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,460
A never-ending journey to be together

424
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,860
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

425
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,330
Hey, do you know about the Navy's curry?

426
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,190
Nope.

427
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,050
It's famous.

428
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,510
I hear that the chef on each ship
competes with all the others.

429
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,100
Oh, yeah? That sounds yummy.

430
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,200
The kid who fell from a Navy ship
earlier says he is a probationary cook.

431
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,570
It reminds me of my time
at the sea restaurant...

432
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,480
On the next episode of One Piece!

433
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,780
"A Recipe Handed Down!
Sanji, the Iron Man of Curry"

434
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
