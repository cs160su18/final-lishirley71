00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,270
Sanji and Usopp snuck aboard
the Ark Maxim to rescue Nami.

18
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,490
I'm sure they've been aware
of us for a long while now!

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,690
They know?! What're we gonna do?! Hey!

20
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,390
There's no point in worrying about it.

21
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,410
We'll split up inside and
head straight for the deck!

22
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,490
Nami-san is there!

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,050
Meanwhile, Luffy had a gold ball
attached to his arm by Eneru

24
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,040
and was thrown from the Maxim
into the ruins of Shandora,

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,780
but he got back up to settle the score.

26
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,450
Alright... Dammit!
I can't get this gold ball off!

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,720
Don't call it that!

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,150
Usopp saved Nami in the nick of time,

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,820
but unable to stand up to Eneru's power,

30
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,330
they found themselves
trapped in a corner, when...

31
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,580
El...

32
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,780
Sanji-kun!

33
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,140
Go.

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,850
...Thor!

35
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,060
I was just about to ask... for a light...

36
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,170
"Capriccio for Despair-- Looming
Destruction of the Sky Islands!!"

37
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,030
I'm going to pay... you say?

38
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,060
What the...?!

39
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,850
The ship!

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,180
No, you didn't!

41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,590
Yeah... You'll pay for this...

42
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,030
Damn you!

43
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,530
What were you doing
inside the ship just now?!

44
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,910
Damn you! You've got some nerve!

45
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,690
The gears have gone awry... I must fix it!

46
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,940
All right! He's gone!

47
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,760
Don't worry! Nami fell safely
into some Island Clouds!

48
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,110
S-So high up!

49
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,630
Not the jungle, not the ruins...
Focus on falling into the Island Clouds!

50
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,190
U-Usopp Hopping!

51
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,710
I-I jumped too far! I jumped too far!

52
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,950
No! I'm falling! I'm gonna crash!
I'm gonna crash and die!

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Yikes! I forgot to unhook it!

54
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,000
Usopp! Sanji-kun!

55
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,020
That voice! Nami! Sounds like
you're all right! That's a relief!

56
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,020
Are you okay, Sanji-kun?!

57
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,790
I'm so sorry you had to get all
charred like this just for us!

58
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,000
I-I can't breathe! N-Nami!
Pull me outta here, quick!

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,820
Oh! Sorry!

60
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,060
Anyways, let's get out of here...

61
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,050
W-Why won't you come out?!

62
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm gonna die...

63
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,880
Curse you, Blue Sea man!

64
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,040
This ship is not so easily brought down.

65
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,770
I'm fully acquainted with
this ship's drive circuits.

66
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,750
Even without electric power,
the wind power from the 200 Jet Dials

67
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,180
I gathered from my homeland of Birka...

68
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,940
...will keep the ship afloat for a while!

69
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,820
No matter what you feeble beings try...

70
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,740
...this land will meet its end!

71
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,650
Look! That huge vine!

72
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,580
If it's the same one I saw in the ruins,

73
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,350
these are the Island Clouds up above them.

74
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,300
Ruins? Oh, the city of gold?! It exists?!

75
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,020
Yeah. But all the gold is in Eneru's hands now.

76
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,760
In any case, Zoro and the others
should be in the ruins below!

77
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,550
"Ruins of Shandora"

78
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,120
"Ruins of Shandora"
"Current Location"

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,350
"Ruins of Shandora"

80
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,850
"Ruins of Shandora"
"Current Location"

81
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,120
"Ruins of Shandora"

82
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,280
"Ruins of Shandora"
"Current Location"

83
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,300
I don't know the topography or anything...

84
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,230
...but I do know it's dangerous to stay here!

85
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,280
Yeah. Get on!

86
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,530
Let's find everyone and get off this island!

87
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah!

88
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,070
There are no safe places left here in Skypiea...

89
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,820
Luffy! Look out!

90
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,350
It's so fast!

91
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,880
L-L-Luffy!

92
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,070
Wait! Not that way! Left! Left!

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Eh?! I can't turn so suddenly!

94
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,190
Gum-Gum Hook!

95
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't destroy my hometown!

96
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,970
Giant Jack's over there!

97
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,450
I know, but--!

98
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,980
Quit destroying stuff!

99
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
Stop!

100
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,700
It's spewing out thunderclouds nicely...

101
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,110
So the rat scurried off...

102
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,140
They're so restless and shrewd...

103
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,090
But no matter. The festivities are soon at hand.

104
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,100
Huh?!

105
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,900
Robin and the others are gone!
Zoro and Chopper...

106
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,970
And Wyper and God...

107
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,210
Where the heck did they go?!

108
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,150
I bet they've already gone up it.

109
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Oh, yeah! Robin!

110
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,730
All right! Let's go!

111
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,780
A-Aisa?

112
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,040
I don't know...

113
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,350
Listen carefully...

114
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,170
The way things stand, this land,
Skypiea, will be annihilated...

115
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,980
The sky island will?!

116
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,490
O-Our village, too?!

117
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,470
Everything...

118
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,490
He said that he'd return
everyone in the sky to the ground...

119
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,070
Luffy.

120
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,660
Yeah?

121
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,910
Are the sky islands... going to disappear?!

122
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,780
Wyper and the others are right through here!

123
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,830
The ship is headed for the grand belfry!

124
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,500
What happened to the
navigator and the others?

125
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,630
If they're on board, could that mean they're...?

126
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,490
We made it through!

127
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,320
Down there! Luffy! Stop! Stop!

128
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,230
Robin!

129
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,220
W-What're you doing?!

130
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,150
Look after these guys!

131
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,160
Stop! Stop!

132
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,620
Luffy...

133
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,520
You... You grew hands!

134
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:12,970
"Gyaaaaa!"

135
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,280
What's that gold on your arm?!

136
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,970
Robin! The gold bell is at
the top of this vine, right?!

137
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,180
And Eneru's after it, right?!

138
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,160
If the belfry does exist, it'd have to be there...

139
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,250
"Gyaaaaa!"

140
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,220
But he's already...

141
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,120
All right, then!

142
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,750
Luffy!

143
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,770
He left...

144
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,880
Say.

145
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,500
Do you know where our
navigator is? She has orange hair...

146
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,840
Eh? If you mean Nami, she's on that ship...

147
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,620
Huh? I only hear one
voice coming from the sky...

148
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,720
There they are!

149
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,760
Robin!

150
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,340
Navigator! Long-nose! Cook!

151
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,320
Aisa! Thank goodness! Are you all right?!

152
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,680
Nami!

153
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,410
Zoro! Chopper!

154
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,800
Weird old man!

155
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,840
Yikes! A guerilla!

156
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,730
Dammit! Everyone's been taken out!
Oh, if only I'd been there!

157
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, yeah! Aisa! Where's Luffy?!
Wasn't he with you?!

158
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,420
Luffy just went up the vine
to rescue you from Eneru!

159
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,290
Eh?! Crap! We just missed each other?!

160
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,230
He left just now. I tried to stop him, but...

161
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,440
Talk about bad timing! There's no
time left! We gotta escape now!

162
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,120
Go ahead! I'll go after him on the waver!

163
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,270
You guys just get to the Merry somehow!

164
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,070
Eh?!

165
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,070
Dammit! That ship's fast!

166
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,040
Eneru!

167
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,040
Get on, quickly! The sky is
getting darker and darker!

168
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,680
What's wrong? You need to escape at once...

169
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,540
Chief... Aisa still hasn't--

170
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,400
I see. She hasn't returned...

171
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,400
Aisa is a bright child. Let us have
faith she is with some warriors...

172
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,520
All right...

173
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,710
Hurry! Hurry up!

174
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,450
Captain!

175
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,270
We can't make it through this
without the ships in the dock!

176
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,670
They'd have to go around the long way!

177
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,410
Men! Use dials to create rivers
inside the island at once!

178
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:56,980
Yes, sir!

179
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,770
Everyone! Please go to Cloud End
and escape to the Blue Sea!

180
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,140
God Eneru plans to eliminate this land!

181
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,000
If you stay here, you'll all die!

182
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,360
For the last six years,
what we've known most of all

183
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,370
is that Eneru has the
power to bring us despair!

184
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,380
And that the time is imminent!

185
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,550
What's the point of waiting
for a miracle to happen?!

186
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,740
Before you pray... Before you
turn a blind eye to reality...

187
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,300
...you have to do what you can!

188
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,960
The time where you could survive
if you lie low as a victim is over!

189
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,180
You have to take action!

190
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,100
You can't protect your own life
by blaming someone later!

191
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,820
Come on now! Make the
decision to leave this land!

192
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,830
How many islanders are left?!

193
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,250
Still half of them!

194
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,830
No more baggage allowed!
Get all the islanders out to sea!

195
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,550
Yes, sir!

196
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,310
Hold it! Leave the
two-billion-Extol-per-person departure fee!

197
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,550
Amazon-san! You need to escape, too!

198
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,020
Eh?

199
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,360
Hurry! To Cloud End!

200
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,810
Eh?

201
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,680
This land...

202
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:35,990
Eh?

203
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,100
It's about to be destroyed!

204
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,990
Eh?

205
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,670
The wind stopped...

206
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,490
Run! Run!

207
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,870
The time has come.

208
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,100
Now then. Let us...

209
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,800
...begin the festivities.

210
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,050
Mamaragan!

211
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,170
Get away from the island!

212
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,020
Don't dawdle!

213
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,750
The lightning is getting bigger and bigger!

214
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,860
The boats in the port have been destroyed!

215
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,150
To the western end of the beach!
Quickly! There are still boats there!

216
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,590
Run to the west!

217
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,050
Quickly! Toss your belongings!

218
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,720
Chief! You need to get on a boat!

219
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,110
Yes...

220
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,850
Great Warrior Calgara...

221
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,440
Please protect everyone...

222
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,700
What huge lightning!

223
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,180
We're gonna end up sky dust if we stay here!

224
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,280
Everyone! Hurry to the ship!
I'll get Luffy and bring him back!

225
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,330
A-A-All right! Got it!

226
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,770
Hurry, Robin!

227
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,970
We gotta carry these guys
to the ship somehow!

228
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,220
Wyper!

229
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,690
Swordsman!

230
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,490
Weird old man!

231
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,820
Thank goodness! You're conscious!

232
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey! We have no time! Can you walk?!

233
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,300
Eneru! So you've started it...

234
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,100
Let's hurry. There's nothing we can do here.

235
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,960
Wyper...

236
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,410
Not even Luffy can deal with
an enemy flying into the sky!

237
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,800
Make it in time! We gotta escape
before this land is destroyed!

238
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,670
An exquisite view!

239
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,940
Don't assume things are gonna
turn out how you want, Eneru!

240
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

241
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

242
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

243
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

244
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

245
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

246
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

247
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

248
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,540
Some 400 years ago,
there was a man known as a liar.

249
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,770
No one believed him as he was
executed for his great lies and trickery.

250
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,310
But the truth was still passed on
in the clouds high above!

251
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

252
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,580
"Led by a Bell's Sound! Tale of
the Great Warrior and the Explorer"

253
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
