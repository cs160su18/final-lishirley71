2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,270
10 years ago in the East Blue,

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,960
there were 3 boys who dreamed
of becoming pirates.

61
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,400
First, Sabo set sail and then Ace
went out to sea 7 years later.

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,740
See you, Luffy! I'm going now!

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,540
And 3 years later,

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,880
Luffy departed
from his hometown - Windmill Village.

65
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,590
Sabo was first and Ace was second.

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,820
And I'm third but I'm gonna top them!

67
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,260
Wait for me, Ace!

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,180
I'll catch up with you soon!

69
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,940
And now, Luffy is...

70
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,190
The King of the Pirates?!

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm...

72
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm...

73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm too...

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,530
...weak!!

75
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,160
"I Want to See Them! Luffy's Mournful Cry!"

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,860
Let's go along the Grand Line!

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,110
We're gonna take over the world!

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,660
Let's start with that island!

79
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,050
Give me cannonballs!

80
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,930
Meteor Fist Shower!

81
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,630
Here, here, here, here!

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,960
You've had enough for today.

83
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,800
--It's Garp-san!
--Garp-san is back with his ship!

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,830
On business?!

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,080
"EAST BLUE" GOA KINGDOM--WINDMILL VILLAGE

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,180
Garp-san, I've read about
the war in the newspaper!

87
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,260
It said it was a great victory for the Navy!

88
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,010
--Hey, how is everybody here doing?
--What happened to Luffy?

89
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,600
What's gonna happen to the world
after Whitebeard's death, Garp-san?

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,730
I've seen pirate ships offshore
frequently over the past few days.

91
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,980
We can't even sleep in peace at night
because we fear their invasion.

92
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,200
Don't worry! I just sank
three of them out at sea!

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,530
Really?! That's great!

94
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,480
They were all amateurs who
don't even know how to fight.

95
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,680
But for a while,

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,580
the seas will be uneasy all over the
world because Whitebeard was a deterrent.

97
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,160
This is a remote village in the East
Blue but you have to be careful.

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,510
--Hey!
--Yes, sir!

99
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:15,930
SECURITY BY NAVY VICE ADMIRAL GARP

100
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,000
"Security by Navy Vice Admiral
Garp"? Oh, I feel safe!

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,930
We don't have to be afraid of anything!

102
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,980
Garp-san, we have another problem.

103
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,400
Mountain bandits came down to the village

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
and they're taking over Makino's bar.

105
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,360
Mountain bandits?

106
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,900
No! You can't do that!

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,430
Hey, Garp!

108
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,830
Oh, that's her!

109
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,250
How dare you come back
and show your face here?!

110
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,960
Garp-san!

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,590
B-Boss!

112
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,800
Vice Admiral Garp!

113
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,650
Stay out of it! I know her.

114
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,040
You bastard...

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,620
You were there at the battlefield...

116
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,640
You were there with them!
What did you do to help?!

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,530
What did you do to help?!

118
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,330
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,700
Why did you stand by and watch Ace die?!

120
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,670
You chose your job over your family?!

121
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,220
Hey, Garp! You're the hero of the Navy?!

122
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,200
Go to hell, you old bastard!

123
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,310
--Easy, easy, boss, stop it!
--Boss!

124
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,480
Garp, say something!

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Why didn't you help him?! Why
didn't you do something?!

126
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,230
Get on your feet!

127
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,440
You cold-blooded scum!

128
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,320
Stop it, Dadan-san!

129
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,080
Makino...

130
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,270
Can't you see that he's taking
it harder than anybody else

131
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,850
because he couldn't help them
even though he was there?!

132
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,950
Th-That's not true.

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,580
That's not true.

134
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,000
That's not true!

135
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,750
Luffy's having a harder time than anyone!

136
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,640
Okay, let's start today's lesson
of how to express gratitude.

137
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,680
Yeah, let's get started already!

138
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,900
Oh, you got it, Ace!

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
No, that's not right.

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,440
You have to say "Thank you
in advance" on that occasion.

141
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,740
Oh, that wasn't right?
It sounded cool though.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
Ace-kun wants to learn this

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,370
because he
wants to say "thank you" properly...

144
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,080
...to the captain of the Red-Haired
Pirates who helped Luffy.

145
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,040
To Shanks?!

146
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah, I will be a pirate by
the time I see Red-Haired.

147
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,470
As a pirate and as your old
brother, it's my job to thank him.

148
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,180
Now, let's do it pretending that
he's right in front of you.

149
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm Ace. Who the hell are you?

150
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,270
Booh! That's not right. It's
not nice to say "the hell."

151
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,650
Is it "Who the heck are you"?

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,280
Give me your name.

153
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Booh.

154
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,370
You have to say "you fool"!

155
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,830
Who are you, you bastard?

156
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,290
Booh!

157
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,040
Who is this?

158
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,870
Booh!

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,340
"Whom" is this?

160
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,290
Booh!

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,630
Stop it! Are you serious?

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,010
You're bugging me by saying
stupid things! Go away!

163
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:27,680
Listen, Ace, I found an anaconda's
nest filled with big eggs!

164
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,390
Let's go get some now!

165
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,780
What? Big eggs?!

166
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,820
No, I can't!

167
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,570
I wanna learn how to pay respect!

168
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,450
I could get hurt if no one's
there and the anaconda finds me!

169
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,830
But I'll be safe if you come with me! So...

170
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,160
Shut up!

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,880
He loved his brother so much!

172
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,550
Makino!

173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,350
Garp.

174
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
What happened to Luffy?

175
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,970
It said in the newspaper
that he went missing.

176
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,900
Mayor.

177
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,790
He got away by submarine.

178
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,750
The Navy went after him in full force
and searched for him desperately

179
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,420
but they didn't find any shipwreck.

180
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,460
So he's probably alive!

181
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, that's great!

182
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,180
But how does Navy Vice Admiral
Garp-san know the mountain bandit?

183
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,470
Don't know.

184
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,400
Luffy is so stupid.

185
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,570
But I'll take his side no matter
what kind of pirate he becomes.

186
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,950
It breaks my heart when I think
about how he must feel now.

187
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,590
Luffy!!

188
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,340
Don't be defeated!!

189
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,020
Meanwhile, far away in the
second half of the Grand Line -

190
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,980
the New World...

191
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,040
Red-Haired,

192
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,720
I've no words to express my gratitude.

193
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,740
Stop talking nonsense.

194
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,650
I always respected Whitebeard,
even though he was my enemy.

195
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,020
Even Sengoku respected him.

196
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,350
Whitebeard, Ace...

197
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,030
Let us handle the burial of those two.

198
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,120
I agree! I will take the blame on myself!

199
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,600
Alright, we should go now.

200
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,380
Yes. Thanks.

201
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,050
Luffy must be having a hard time.

202
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,810
I can't believe what Ace did.

203
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,850
Take back what you just said!

204
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,270
Don't make fun of the man who saved me!

205
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,780
The name of this era should be "Whitebeard"!

206
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,550
That's what Captain Roger would've done.

207
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,050
I wanted the captain to run away sometimes

208
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,310
and be able to shed tears.

209
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
Listen, Luffy.

210
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,660
By experiencing both victory and defeat,

211
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,920
running away and shedding tears,

212
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,170
a man will become a man.

213
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,170
It's okay to cry.

214
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,060
But you have to move on!

215
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,940
"CALM BELT" MAIDEN ISLAND

216
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,660
Damn!

217
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,620
I'm too weak! I can't save anybody!

218
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,660
Damn! Damn!

219
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,040
Damn! Damn!

220
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,140
Damn! Damn!

221
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,290
Dammit!!

222
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,360
Luffy-kun.

223
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,930
Go away!

224
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,100
Leave me alone!

225
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,700
I can't!

226
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,650
I can't just watch you hurt yourself anymore.

227
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,900
It's my own body! It's none of your business!

228
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,200
Then you can't blame Ace
for doing what he did.

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,660
His death was not your business!

230
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,450
Shut up, you bastard! I'm gonna
beat you if you say another word!

231
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,670
Do it if it makes you happy!

232
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,630
I'm injured too but I'm not gonna
get beaten by you in that condition!

233
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,670
Gum-Gum...

234
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,180
...Pistol!

235
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,830
Jimbei...

236
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,740
When I was going after Teach,

237
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,270
I saw my brother for the first time
in 3 years in Alabasta Kingdom.

238
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,130
And I felt relieved instantly as I saw him.

239
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,890
Do you know why?

240
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,730
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

241
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,570
That hurts, you brat!

242
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,280
Can't you see things clearly now?!

243
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,910
You believed that you
could overcome anything!

244
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,840
And you've never doubted your strength!

245
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:54,010
But all those formidable enemies
took away your confidence!

246
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,000
And your brother was your guide on the sea!

247
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,390
I know that you have lost a lot!

248
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,040
And the toughest enemies in the world

249
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,890
blocked your way time after time!

250
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,230
Your power is not enough to beat me!

251
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,530
You could be level-headed.

252
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,910
Go, Pacifistas!

253
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,140
You can't get away from me!

254
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,880
You'll never find your way like this!

255
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,740
Because you've lost yourself
in regret and guilt!

256
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,380
I know that it's painful now, Luffy,

257
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,200
but you have to bottle up those feelings!

258
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,540
Don't just think about the ones you've lost!

259
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,250
You can't get back what you've lost!

260
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,090
What is it that you still have?!

261
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,140
Luffy, don't fool around
here. I'm training now.

262
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,770
Luffy! Tell everybody to take their post!

263
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,480
A storm is coming!

264
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,400
Luffy, you just see if I don't!

265
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,990
I'm gonna catch a big one soon!

266
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,080
Luffy, it's almost ready
so just shut up and wait.

267
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,300
Luffy, no matter how serious your
injury is, you're in good hands!

268
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,880
I'll treat you!

269
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,430
Oh, Luffy!

270
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,720
I can teach you about archeology
if you're interested.

271
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,200
Hey, Luffy! The Cola engine
is in top shape as always!

272
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,530
You can leave everything
about the Sunny to me!

273
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,970
Good morning, Luffy-san! It's morning!

274
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,010
Now here is the first song for today!

275
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,630
Luffy.

276
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,940
Luffy!

277
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,050
Luffy!

278
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
Luffy.

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,430
Luffy!

280
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,140
Luffy.

281
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,850
Luffy!

282
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,760
Luffy-san!

283
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,730
Luffy!

284
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,740
I still have...

285
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,330
I still have my friends!

286
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,580
Zoro! Nami! Usopp! Sanji!

287
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,750
Chopper! Robin! Franky! Brook!

288
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,710
They are my friends!

289
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,340
I see.

290
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,090
I have to meet them on the ship.

291
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,980
Guys! Meet on the Sunny in three days!

292
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,350
Okay!

293
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,030
I gotta go! It took a while but...

294
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,440
...I know that they're waiting for me!

295
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,450
What I saw there, Jimbei, was...

296
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,790
Older brothers can't help worrying...

297
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,870
...if their younger brother is weak.

298
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,880
I know that he'll be a handful

299
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,360
but please look after him.

300
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,550
Luffy wasn't just the kid who
used to follow me around anymore.

301
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,620
He had...

302
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,410
...such reliable friends!

303
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,020
He'll be alright no matter what happens.

304
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,080
That's why I felt relieved.

305
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,740
I wanna see them now...

306
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,630
I wanna see them!!

307
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,550
Luffy is missing his friends...

308
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,260
At the same time, far across the sea,

309
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,140
the friends he'd been separated from

310
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,060
are still fighting their own battles to
make it back to the Sabaody Archipelago.

311
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,520
Meanwhile, news of the "War of the Best"
makes its way to the separated friends!

312
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,940
"Straw Hats in Shock!
The Bad News Has Reached Them!"

314
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,410
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
