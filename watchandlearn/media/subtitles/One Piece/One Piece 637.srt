The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580
We will keep making our own route

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,830
Go along with your curiosity

53

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,480
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,720
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,670
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,830
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,700
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,390
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,630
When Luffy found out that
the prize for a fighting

77
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,770
event was the Flare-Flare
Fruit, he decided to enter.

78
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,420
The first round is a battle royal
where only one can win.

79
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,940
Burgess from the Blackbeard Pirates won
the match of Block A.

80
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,510
Now, the battle of Block B has begun.

81
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,120
Let the battle...

82
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,660
...begin!

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,370
Oh shit! I'm gonna fall!

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,470
A school of Little Fighting Fish!

85
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh, is this the place to watch the battle?

86
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,530
You're...

87
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,510
How is Garp-san doing?

88
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,060
Straw Hat Luffy-kun!

89
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,270
You know my grandpa?

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,500
What?!

91
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,490
I almost got killed by Garp-san once.

92
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,440
And I've made up my mind to carry the grudge

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
even against his children and grandchildren.

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,700
"Big Names Duke It Out!
The Heated Block B Battle!"

95
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,020
Garp was like a real demon
for us pirates back then.

96
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,310
It's been decades now
but my wound hasn't healed.

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,890
Hey, is it true?!

98
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,890
No, no, no... I just misheard it! I'm Lucy!

99
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,260
You don't mishear your own name!

100
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,180
I need you to pay for
what your grandfather did to me.

101
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
What my grandpa did is none of my business!

102
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,510
So you are Garp's grandson!

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,770
No, I'm not!

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,930
If you're the real Straw Hat Luffy,

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,580
I'm gonna chop you up now!

106
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:15,400
If I had found out about the existence of
Garp's son Dragon sooner,

107
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,160
you would have never been born.

108
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,730
Hey, what happened?!

109
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,380
Don Chinjao is going crazy!

110
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,440
That's not good!

111
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,580
Hey, wait a minute, old pops!

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,010
Take that beard off!

113
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,180
Stop! No! Let go of me! Let go!

114
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,020
You've got to be kidding!
Is he gonna attack again?!

115
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,970
I don't know how much weaker he's become

116
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,130
but his bounty was more than 500 million berries
at his peak!

117
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,850
I'm Lu...

118
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,220
Damn you Don Chinjao! Back off!

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,860
He's my enemy!

120
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,630
Cavendish drew his sword!

121
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,010
Is that it?!

122
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,220
One of the greatest swords
in the world - Durandal!

123
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,460
Here it goes! Head-Arms!

124
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,760
Beautiful Sword!

125
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,500
Blue Bird!

126
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,520
It's piercing his skull...

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,200
No, it isn't!

128
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,680
They're pushing against each other!

129
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,550
I can't stab him with Durandal!

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,900
A skull impervious to a sword!
The power to push back a giant!

131
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,620
They're both beyond human power!

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,310
I can't take him down without going all out!

133
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,920
You bastard!

134
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,390
I said "Stop"!

135
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,930
He knocked down Chinjao!

136
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,770
Who is that little bearded guy?!

137
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh my...

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,710
Wow! It didn't work against him!

139
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,720
Maybe the legend about him is true!

140
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,910
They say he broke up the Ice Continent
with a head-butt!

141
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,590
The Ice Continent?!

142
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,860
It didn't work at all.
I thought I used enough strength.

143
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,610
Oh my...

144
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,360
It seems like you two are quite strong!

145
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,710
But you guys need more training!

146
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,250
Seeing how strong you are...
I'm now sure you're Straw Hat.

147
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone!

148
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,900
Being born as a grandson of the demon

149
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,970
and stealing other people's popularity -

150
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,890
you really incur everybody's hatred.

151
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,860
Neither of those things are my fault!

152
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,530
I'm Lucy, by the way.

153
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,410
If you keep standing in my way,
I'm gonna kill you, too, young knight!

154
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,950
Wait, wait, old man! That's enough!

155
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,380
If you cause trouble here,
they'll eliminate you!

156
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,490
It's Sai and Boo from the Kano Kingdom!

157
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,590
Let go of me, my dear grandsons!

158
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,560
No! I don't know what's going on
but you got to stop!

159
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,580
I finally found my sworn
enemy - Garp's grandson!

160
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,090
If we get eliminated here,

161
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,740
we can't fulfill the real purpose
that we entered for, grandpa!

162
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,110
Hey, you guys!
What's going on over there?!

163
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,610
We'll have to ask you to leave
if you're fighting outside of the ring!

164
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,100
The guards are coming.

165
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,250
I don't care if I get eliminated here or not!

166
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,020
I'm going to...

167
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,340
Where did he go?!

168
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,990
Old man, the guy with the fake beard

169
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,440
is in Block C so are we!

170
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,700
If you wanna kill him, do it in the match!

171
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,670
I'm not gonna let you get away, Straw Hat!

172
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,810
I'm gonna kill you before the match!

173
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,580
What a mess. What was that all about?

174
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,020
I heard someone said "Straw Hat."

175
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,960
It reminds me of the
pirate - Straw Hat Luffy.

176
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,490
Do you think he entered this competition?

177
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,050
No way!

178
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,200
Boy...

179
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,370
I promised Franky that
I wouldn't let anybody know who I am!

180
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,240
There are about 70 competitors
left in the ring now!

181
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,650
Already half of the competitors are gone!

182
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,580
We are coming to the moment of truth!

183
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,760
Hack, the master of the Fish-Man Karate,

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,030
has taken down his 17th opponent!

185
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,230
Hey you stupid Fish-Man!

186
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,170
Why are you participating in
a human competition, freak?!

187
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,180
Say something! Hey, fish!

188
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,910
Poor man.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,150
Huh?!

190
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,670
I can't hear you!

191
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,320
You're like a puppet
who can't speak in words of its own.

192
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,920
Let's "communicate" with our fists at least!

193
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,410
That's a good idea!

194
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm gonna smash your annoying fists!

195
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,660
Oh? It got stuck!

196
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,890
4000 Brick Fist!

197
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,620
That was awesome, Hack!
He beat his 18th opponent!

198
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,160
Like my friend and our
species' hope, Jimbei, does,

199
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,030
we can establish friendly relations
with our fists!

200
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,610
Hence, I'm gonna keep fighting!

201
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,520
Cool! Was that the famous Fish-Man Karate?!

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,620
And this man is runner-up!

203
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,120
An unknown gladiator who burst
into prominence - Ricky!

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,230
He may be the one everyone should
keep an eye on in Block B!

205
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,300
He did it! He cut down his 16th man!

206
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,650
--Hey!
--Huh?

207
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,150
There is a gladiator who
I've never seen before.

208
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,900
What are you saying?!
We're in the middle of a fight!

209
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,310
Look! That's the guy!

210
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,150
He's quite strong. Do you know him?

211
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,250
I've been fighting here as
a gladiator for a long time

212
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,550
but I've never seen him before!

213
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,190
Gladiators of this Colosseum

214
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,460
are trained to fight
with a sword and a shield!

215
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,360
But he just uses a sword!
Like a samurai from the Wano Kingdom!

216
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,070
Let's test his skill!\

217
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,870
Okay!

218
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,060
Too slow!

219
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,680
Now, Ricky beat the same
number of men as Hack!

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,030
Did you just see what the gladiator
with a skull on his cape did?

221
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,010
Yeah.

222
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,230
He's that strong but I don't
remember seeing him here before.

223
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,050
Well, I was gonna say...

224
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,500
I think I've seen him before.

225
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,040
A man who fought like that without a shield.

226
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,410
What was his name?

227
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,830
Abdullah!

228
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,940
Take this!

229
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,090
Jeet!

230
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,760
You're showing your back to me!

231
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,390
You cowards!

232
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,230
I can't believe it!

233
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:13,640
Jeet and Abdullah, a pair of evils,
beat 10 strong men at once!

234
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,200
"Cowards"?

235
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,020
I like the sound of that!

236
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,650
Let's kick that guy's ass next!

237
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,530
Alright!

238
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,370
He went over to Elizabello's
side, huh? Great!

239
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,480
Now, Blue Gilly is attacking
Elizabello II's clan!

240
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,660
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow... Damn that bastard!

241
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,600
What the hell are you doing?!
He's just an unarmed, spindly man!

242
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,700
I-It doesn't matter
whether he's unarmed or spindly!

243
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,230
His legs are like iron whips!

244
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,730
Hey guys, come closer!

245
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,660
It's too boring when you're standing back like that!

246
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
He's just a guy from the Longfeet Tribe!

247
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,620
Why don't you try to attack his legs, then?!

248
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,430
It's impossible!
We can't approach him!

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,180
That movement!

250
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,300
I can't figure out where his
kick is gonna come from!

251
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,380
Damn! I don't care anymore!

252
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,450
That's a hell of a kick!

253
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,840
Blue Gilly kicked some guys' ass again!

254
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,100
I think you can't protect your king
with such weak soldiers.

255
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,140
Looks like he has spirit.

256
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,580
Oh, in the meantime,
Abdullah and Tank are facing each other!

257
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,060
What the...

258
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,600
I-I can't believe it!
They're taking down Tank!

259
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,870
The military captain of
Dressrosa's Self-Defense Army -

260
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,180
Tank Lepant got eliminated!

261
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,120
He fell a prey to the pair of evils -
Abdullah and Jeet!

262
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,700
They keep using dirty tricks!

263
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,820
Captain Tank!

264
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,750
Over a 100 competitors have been eliminated

265
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,100
and there are only 30 some
men left in the ring!

266
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,360
A little more to go.

267
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,510
It doesn't matter how tough
the remaining one will be

268
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,220
as long as we have the King Punch...

269
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,200
Competitors led by Dagama, the tactician,

270
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,860
are protecting Elizabello II,
the king of Prodence Kingdom!

271
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,660
When is he going to throw
the devastating King Punch?!

272
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,410
Who's next?!

273
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,500
Those who wish to bleed, come fight us!

274
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,340
The pair of evils - Abdullah and Jeet

275
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,870
who took down the strong man - Lepant,

276
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,100
are trying to provoke their next victim!

277
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,250
What?!

278
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,810
Bellamy!

279
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,600
Bellamy-sama!

280
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,590
"Atrocious"! "Evil"!

281
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,640
Those are the words only fitting to this man!

282
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,580
Is he the top contender to
beat Elizabello II after all?!

283
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,150
In the meantime,
the Jiaokungdo martial artist - Blue Gilly

284
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,450
and the mysterious gladiator - Ricky,

285
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,460
the two strong men are fighting each other!

286
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,000
That Fish-Man is so tough!

287
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,350
He's been knocking out all of his
opponents with a single blow!

288
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,820
That's so cool!

289
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm so excited!

290
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,680
It seems like one of these competitors
is likely to win Block B!

291
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Stop him!

292
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,360
Unbelievable!

293
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,160
How much more does Bartolomeo
want to offend other people?!

294
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,900
Why is nobody kicking his ass?!

295
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,540
In front of this huge audience,

296
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,240
he pulled it out and started peeing!

297
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,440
No one has ever done such a thing
in this Colosseum!

298
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,220
It feels so good!

299
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,780
Somebody, stop him!

300
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,710
Here comes that somebody!

301
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,880
Some of us are taking this
thing seriously, brat!

302
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,860
What?

303
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,200
You'll have to excuse me
for attacking you from behind!

304
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,440
Hey, wait! I'm not even
ready to fight back! Hey...

305
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,250
The hero who came in to punish him is
the Fish-Man warrior - Hack!

306
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,050
4000 Brick...

307
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,090
Do it! Kick his ass, Hack!

308
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,000
...Fist!

309
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,870
He did it!

310
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,740
Just kidding!

311
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,030
What did he do?!
Hack is the one who collapsed!

312
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,140
What's going on?!

313
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,130
What was that?

314
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,880
Wh-What kind of monster are you?!

315
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,410
Bartolomeo!
