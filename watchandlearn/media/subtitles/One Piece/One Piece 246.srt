2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,740
Don't go, Robin!

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,120
We're not done talking yet!

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,080
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,880
Luffy! Hurry up and catch Robin!

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,020
Robin!

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,610
How can they be that strong?!

8
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,660
What are you people?

9
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,990
We are CP9.

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,290
This is a world-class top secret.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,380
It's not a matter that people
like you can get involved in.

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,590
It's about time for the igniters
to go off. We have to hurry, too.

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,470
Yeah.

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,300
But this is a rare occasion.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,560
Let me show you something
interesting before we go.

16
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,080
A Devil Fruit!

17
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,920
Which one?!

18
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,300
Lucci... What the...?

19
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,260
The Cat-Cat Fruit...

20
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,020
Leopard Model...

21
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,860
A leopard human...

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,360
H-He's huge!

23
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,990
What's with that appearance?!

24
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,320
What the hell are you?!

25
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,710
It's all right! Now let's move forward

26
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,670
with the sun always in our hearts

27
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,010
As power passes through our clasped hands

28
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,680
let's grab hold of our wishes

29
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:57,650
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

31
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,960
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:19,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,470
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

34
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

35
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,430
And if you get into a jam

36
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,480
I'll always be there to protect you

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

38
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,200
with the sun always in our hearts

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,490
and gaze at the light beyond

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

42
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

43
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

44
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,470
under the same flag-- together, we're one

45
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,100
One Piece

46
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:23,070
"The Straw Hat Pirates Annihilated?
The Menace of the Leopard Model!"

47
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,780
Fire!

48
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,740
Hey, everyone! Wake up!

49
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,960
Dammit...! Is this the pirates' doing?

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,670
There must still be a lot of people left inside!

51
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,300
Where's Iceberg-san?!
What's going on upstairs?!

52
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,840
Let's go check!

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,300
Hurry! The rest of you, put out the fire!

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,230
Looks like the fire has started to spread.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,280
I don't know if you're a
leopard human or what, but...

56
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,950
...I won't let you lay a finger on Iceberg-san!

57
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,340
Oh, no! Carnivore Zoan types
become more brutal!

58
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,840
That's right. Logia types,
Zoan types, and Paramythia types...

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,220
Many unique powers exist.

60
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,270
Genuine physical augmentation
is the trait of Zoan types.

61
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,730
The more we train, the stronger we get.

62
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,150
The Zoan type is the strongest species
when it comes to a close attack.

63
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,740
Shut up!

64
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I don't wanna hear stuff
about monsters like that!

65
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,710
We don't want to waste time, either...

66
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,090
...since we have to take care of you guys
before we get wrapped up in flames.

67
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,550
Iceberg-san!

68
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,010
Foremen!

69
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Lucci... the craftsmen are coming upstairs.

70
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,930
Don't worry. They can't make it this far.

71
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,970
Tempest Kick!

72
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,110
Go back! The ceiling is...!

73
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,660
Nami!

74
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,050
Chopper!

75
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,930
Paulie, what're you doing?

76
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm taking you out of this place no matter what!

77
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,970
It's not possible! Your injuries
are too severe! How can you...

78
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Stop it, Paulie.

79
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,490
Don't call my name... as if we're friends!

80
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,660
Get... out of our way!

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,380
Damn you...!

82
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,090
Why did it have to be you guys?!

83
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,840
I...

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,140
...at least...

85
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,560
I considered you guys my friends all this time!

86
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,560
It was just you.

87
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,620
Pigeon jerk...!

88
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,950
Straw Hat!

89
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,250
Finger Pistol.

90
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,550
Luffy!

91
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,200
Have a nice flight off the island!

92
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,620
Luffy!

93
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,210
You bastard!

94
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,260
Iron Body.

95
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,730
Zoro!

96
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,330
You too.

97
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,710
Grandma! Grandma! There's a big fire!

98
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,670
That's Galley-La's main office.
What a terrible thing to do...

99
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,180
A terrible thing? Did someone set the fire?

100
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,680
Well, I don't know...

101
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,020
...but often, a bad feeling turns out to be right.

102
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,140
I hope Iceberg is okay.

103
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,360
Seriously, this is all because of
that thing. It just shouldn't exist.

104
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,500
What pirates say cannot be evidence.

105
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,290
This incident will now be shrouded in darkness.

106
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,710
Iceberg-san... No matter how good
of a shipbuilding engineer you are,

107
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,300
or even if you're the mayor of a big city...

108
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,510
...you, a mere citizen, shouldn't have disobeyed

109
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,010
the powerful World Government.

110
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,530
Let's go. We'll find Tom's
other disciple Franky--

111
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,030
rather, Cutty Flam, and take
the blueprints from him.

112
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,800
Did you get everyone out of the building?!

113
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,550
We can't go inside anymore!
Have each team account for its men!

114
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,680
Hey, where's Iceberg-san? Did you see him?

115
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,440
Don't tell me he's still in this fire...

116
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm sure he's okay!

117
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,440
Three of our foremen are with him.
There's no way he got left in there.

118
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
You guys go check around there, too!

119
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,240
This woman...

120
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,200
She's one of the Straw Hats. There's no mistake!

121
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,000
Did she jump out a window?

122
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,500
She was probably surrounded by
flames and had trouble escaping.

123
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,460
What do we do with her?

124
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,670
Seriously... what a terrible thing they've done.

125
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,970
We'll make her tell us where the others are!

126
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,550
We'll capture all of them and
hand them over to the Navy!

127
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,020
Blueno... So Franky was at your bar?

128
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,190
Yeah.

129
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,740
But he rushed out to find Straw Hat.

130
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,360
I see...

131
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,950
Seems like he doesn't stay in one place for long.

132
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,870
But people with bad timing really exist.

133
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,830
Look.

134
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,840
Listen, Straw Hat!

135
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,800
We've got Long-nose with us!

136
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,130
That's right, we do!

137
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,760
If you don't want him to sing in the key of C...

138
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,600
Idiot! That's not it! How many
times do I have to tell you?!

139
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,810
That's "If you don't want him to sink in the sea"!

140
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,060
In the key of C...

141
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,770
"In the sea"!

142
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,310
Geez, what were you listening to?!

143
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,520
What's important is to get the
message to Straw Hat, right?!

144
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,570
We're saying that message ain't gonna work!

145
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,650
Bro is gonna beat you up.

146
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,700
You say it like, "If you don't
want him to sink in the sea,

147
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,450
come to the warehouse under the bridge!
Franky sends his regards!"

148
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,830
Got that?!

149
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,540
Mind you, even if he comes, Bro is
gonna beat the crap out of him, though.

150
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,130
Who did you say is waiting for whom where?

151
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,260
Hm? Who the hell are you?!

152
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,800
We're busy right now! Get lost!

153
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,260
If you don't wanna die,
answer my question in three seconds.

154
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,970
Huh?!

155
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,310
This guy's talking nonsense.

156
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,940
Do you know what family we're in?

157
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,490
Which place do you mean by
the warehouse under the bridge?

158
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,280
Franky is there, isn't he?

159
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,990
What business do you have with Bro?

160
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,620
If you wanna talk to him, then talk to us first!

161
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,890
To think that you left the friends
you traveled together with

162
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,270
all the way from the East Blue, for the ship...

163
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,190
What are you guys crying for?

164
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,110
You dummy! We're not crying, you dummy!

165
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,610
But it's true that I was moved by your
protecting this ship all by yourself

166
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,530
while all those things were happening!

167
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,240
We're not crying! None of us are crying!

168
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,580
What the heck is their problem?

169
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,630
Anyway, now you know that those guys
and I are no longer friends, right?!

170
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,380
I'll...

171
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,050
I'll sing about your hardships!

172
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,430
The song title is, "Severed Friendship!
Northern Wind Chop!"

173
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,300
Yay! Bro!

174
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,350
Are you making fun of me?!

175
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,270
Hey, is the tea ready yet? I'm thirsty.

176
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,280
Okay! We'll bring it right over!

177
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,910
I'm exhausted from crying...
Not that I cried, though.

178
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,330
Here you go, Bro. It's a little hot.

179
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,000
Thanks.

180
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,590
Then, I get it, brother, you know...

181
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,050
Ouch, it's hot!

182
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,840
Settle down a little, will you?!

183
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,180
I'm sorry, Bro.

184
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,680
Why don't you take a break
and have some tea, too?

185
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,860
I can't blame you. You must be
holding quite a grudge against us

186
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,070
for taking 200 million Berries
away from you guys...

187
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,700
...since it led to such a big fight.

188
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,830
It was meant to happen, that's all.

189
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,080
Holding a grudge doesn't do me any good.

190
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,960
You're a good sport.

191
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,090
I see...

192
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,670
That 200 million...

193
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,300
I used it all, though!

194
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,890
You want me to knock you over?

195
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,140
Now, now... Don't get so upset.

196
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,850
You've shown me how manly you are.

197
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,980
So, now I have to calm my anger
over the complete destruction

198
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,780
of the Franky House, which was
my home and demolition factory.

199
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,280
On top of that, you guys
annihilated my subordinates!

200
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,540
How dare you bastards?!

201
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,660
--Bro!
--The anger welled up!

202
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,790
You bastards!

203
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Well, brother, although a lot happened,

204
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,560
let's calm our anger towards
each other on this matter,

205
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,230
and settle it as "Heave-ho! Heave-ho!"

206
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,020
You mean "fifty-fifty."

207
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,320
You mean "fifty-fifty," Bro.

208
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,780
Well, there you go.

209
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,610
What're you gonna do now that you're alone?

210
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,530
You have nowhere to go anyway, right?

211
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,960
If that's the case, I can
take you in. Work for me!

212
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,960
I like you.

213
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,210
No way! I don't wanna
become a demolition worker.

214
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,920
Even though I left my group, I'm still a pirate!

215
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,010
Please listen to my song.
It's titled "The Pirate Code."

216
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,140
Yay! Bro!

217
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,100
Like I said, are you making fun of me?!

218
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,060
Geez... I'm trying to think what
you should do next, for your sake!

219
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,070
It's none of your business!

220
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,240
Besides, is it okay for you
to relax in a place like this?

221
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,030
A storm surge is coming soon, right?

222
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,160
Yeah, that's exactly why...

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
When Aqua Laguna comes,
we all have to help each other.

224
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,250
From now until late into the night,

225
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,920
houses will be submerged
up to the second floor.

226
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,420
If you're in the backstreets or capes at
a time like this, you don't stand a chance.

227
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,970
You don't have to worry if
you keep your ship here too.

228
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,930
Oh... Thanks... I appreciate it.

229
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,930
You dummy! Don't act like we're strangers!

230
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,690
In any case, it must be tough to have
flood damage like that every year.

231
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,780
Well, everyone's used to this
annual evacuation, though.

232
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,570
What's more problematic

233
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,740
is that the water level of the sea
has been increasing every year.

234
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,750
The backstreet area you can see above
the sea now is a town built on the rooftops

235
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,210
of an old town that existed
several hundred years ago.

236
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,750
It's said that the shipbuilding
island and the backstreets

237
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,960
were completely on one land a long time ago.

238
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,220
But now, so much of the area is under
water that it's called a floating city.

239
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,760
All the sidewalks became canals.

240
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,270
Properly speaking, rather than saying
that the water level is increasing,

241
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,310
they say that the foundation
of the island is sinking.

242
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,980
As it stands, the areas in town we can
live in will get smaller and smaller.

243
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,740
I see... Even this pretty floating
city has hardships too, huh?

244
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,120
But, well, if push comes to shove,

245
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
you can take the sea train
and go live somewhere.

246
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,420
You can say that... now.

247
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,840
But it was only a bit over a decade
ago that the sea train was created.

248
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,880
Before that time, it wasn't quite
that easy to go across the sea.

249
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,680
Huh?

250
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,720
Naturally, people were rarely able to
go back and forth between the islands.

251
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,890
On this isolated island,

252
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,520
the residents vaguely imagined
their land being submerged someday

253
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,110
and grew completely hopeless.

254
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,500
What relieved people's
worries even about the future

255
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,540
was the sea train, Puffing Tom.

256
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,670
You can now go across the sea
whenever you want without a Log Pose.

257
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,960
So this was big progress!

258
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,920
I see... I didn't know.

259
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,800
The sea train really is an incredible thing, huh?

260
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,560
Water Seven came back to life.

261
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,770
It's all thanks to a great shipwright
named Tom who created the sea train.

262
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,020
We were all saved by him.

263
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,120
Bro!

264
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,580
Help...

265
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,920
I'll say hello to "Bro" for you.

266
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
We now know the location.

267
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,230
Let's go.

268
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,330
We had a dream that day

269
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,160
Our belief in ourselves

270
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:47,300
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

271
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:56,850
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

272
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:07,030
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

273
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,740
In the end, we can all surely smile

274
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,800
Hey, Long-nose. What're you
gonna do after you fix that ship?

275
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,470
What else? I'll go on an
adventure with her again and...

276
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,550
That's not possible. You can't.

277
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,970
--What'd you say?!
--That ship can't even reach
the next island anymore.

278
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,140
I'll help you demolish that ship.

279
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,060
Stop it! What're you doing?!

280
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,020
On the next episode of One Piece!

281
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,150
"The Man Who Is Loved Even
by His Ship! Usopp's Tears!"

282
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
