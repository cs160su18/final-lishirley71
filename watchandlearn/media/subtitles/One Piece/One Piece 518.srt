00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

your toughness, that’s what it takes

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,880
Being brazen, is it a crime?

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,810
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,900
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,030
and returned on Sabaody Archipelago

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,990
to go on to the next stage the New World.

72
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,910
Oh!

73
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,720
What? Nobody has arrived yet?

74
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,880
Check the poster once again!

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,050
It says "At least 70 million berries bounty."

76
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,260
We're not gonna deal with
captains with less bounty.

77
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,850
Go home.

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
I'll only say it once!

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,940
You're no match for me so I'm
not gonna drink with you!

80
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,150
Sure Kill: Green Star...

81
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,530
..."Devil"!

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,250
So, young lady, do you wanna drink with me?

83
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,220
Come on, baby!

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,180
Yeah!

85
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,510
Because I'm a skeleton, it's...

86
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,850
Bone!

87
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm a real man--Sanji!

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,940
Just come back from hell!

89
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,830
Brook's concert?

90
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,290
The Straw Hats' recruitment?

91
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,410
What is going on?

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,610
Sorry to keep you waiting, Sunny!

93
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,890
We'll be sailing out soon!

94
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,370
Oh, did it hit you? Sorry!

95
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,510
Bye!

96
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,770
Wait a minute!

97
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,130
Huh?

98
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,490
"An Explosive Situation!
Luffy vs. Fake Luffy!"

99
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,830
This is not good...

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,340
That's Sabaody Archipelago in the distance.

101
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,010
Luffy, we have to say goodbye here.

102
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,250
We can't let them discover our relationship.

103
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,540
Uh-huh.

104
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,120
Put this on...

105
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,700
...like this!

106
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't need that! That's too much!

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,650
Yeah?

108
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,320
But in case something happens...

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,100
Uh-huh.

110
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,780
You have to be careful.

111
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,120
Make sure you hide your face.

112
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,370
The world thinks that you're dead but...

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,980
...people know what you
look like from 2 years ago.

114
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,680
If you cause trouble, you
won't be able to set sail.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,420
I got it.

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,320
And in the backpack, I put 50 extra
changes of clothes, 1000 lunches,

117
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,720
handkerchiefs and tissues,

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,320
5 years' worth of towels, 3 years'
worth of water and snacks,

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,690
silverware, toothbrushes, soap,

120
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,730
hand creams and 3 years' worth
of bug bite ointment and...

121
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,730
Make it lighter!

122
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I hope you can meet your friends safely.

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,950
Yeah. Thank you for everything!

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,640
Good luck!

125
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,120
I've heard Sabaody has
become unsafe these days.

126
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Yes. That's why the Navy is paying a
lot of attention to what goes on there.

127
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,970
Take extra care!

128
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,720
Yeah!

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,900
If you need us, we Kuja Pirates
will always come to help you!

130
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,500
Don't forget it.

131
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,150
And could you do me a favor?

132
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,570
What? I'm not gonna marry you.

133
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,940
No, I just want you to leave
without saying goodbye.

134
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,740
Oh, I've never said it to anyone.

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,410
I wanna see you again.

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,370
Alright, I'm off!

137
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,750
--See you!
--Take care, Luffy!

138
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,010
See ya!

139
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,550
He said he wants to see me again!

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,030
Is it what they call...

141
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,180
...a proposal?!

142
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,830
No, it's not!

143
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,360
I've been told by Hancock
not to cause trouble.

144
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,320
Hey, did you hit me on purpose?

145
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,150
H-He's in danger!

146
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,580
GROVE #13 SHAKKY'S RIP-OFF BAR

147
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,240
Wh-What?!

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,580
The stupid swordsman got here first?!

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,580
I can't believe it!

150
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,830
Our new voyage will be rough.

151
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,880
And Franky-chan came
second, about 10 days ago

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,860
and went out to see the ship.

153
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,890
Sunny is alright?

154
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,460
Of course--there isn't even a
scratch and the coating is done.

155
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,780
That's good.

156
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,970
He did a good job.

157
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,810
There's no regret for honorable wounds!

158
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,590
Yes! A year to heal!

159
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,830
I didn't know you had such
a strong sense of duty.

160
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,820
Thank you, Duval.

161
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,720
What, you think I'm handsome?

162
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,070
I returned your favor, young master!

163
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,160
Even on rainy days and windy days,

164
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,010
dangerous pirates tried to steal that ship.

165
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,920
But I fought day after day
even with cuts and bruises!

166
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,080
It was very painful!

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,380
Duval-sama!

168
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,590
Even so, how did you get hurt so badly?

169
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,340
Well, fall for me... I mean,
listen to me, young master.

170
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,740
--That's because the Navy finally...
--And Nami-chan came third...

171
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,390
Nami-san!!

172
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,850
Where's she?!

173
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,490
She went out shopping to kill time.

174
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,690
No interest in my story anymore?!

175
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,990
Nami-san's shopping! Nami-san's shopping!

176
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,990
Usopp-chan came fourth 3
days ago and went to town.

177
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,780
Chopper-chan came fifth yesterday.

178
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,380
Brook-chan has a concert
today on this island...

179
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,530
A concert?

180
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,180
What's that?

181
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,690
And then you came.

182
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,190
So 7 members including you have
already arrived on this archipelago.

183
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,950
We haven't seen Nico Robin and Luffy yet.

184
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,390
It's extremely difficult
just to get to this island.

185
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,930
So you guys are all quite something.

186
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm glad that you can meet them soon.

187
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,780
Yeah. But I can't believe
that you trained Luffy.

188
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,930
He must be incredibly strong now.

189
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,990
I haven't seen him for 6 months.

190
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,120
Can't wait to see his progress.

191
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,950
Progress...

192
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,830
I wonder what kind of progress Nami-san made!

193
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,790
Hey, are you alright?

194
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,740
Y-Young master?

195
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,610
But I endured 2 years of arduous training.

196
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,460
So I have to shake off any sign
of seduction and show my results!

197
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,680
He's just saying that!

198
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,640
GROVE #47

199
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,830
Run!

200
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,770
Some thugs are fighting again!

201
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,660
I thought that the pirates would
settle down after Whitebeard died...

202
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,200
It's the opposite!

203
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,560
They're coming from everywhere

204
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,620
and the whole island has become lawless!

205
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,620
I didn't know that. It's dangerous.

206
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,820
Did you get it?

207
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,160
Blackbeard, Kid, and Drake are doing

208
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,270
whatever they want in the New World

209
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,100
and we're the ones who'll
follow... I mean, beat them!

210
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,060
--Hey, look!
--Th-They are...

211
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,440
What they say was true as I thought.

212
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,450
They were thought to be dead fighting
against the Navy 2 years ago

213
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,400
but they showed up again on this island.

214
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,330
Yeah, and they're the most powerful
pirate group on the island...

215
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,240
The Straw Hats...

216
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,810
Huh? Is it Nami?! Usopp?!

217
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,330
What? The Straw Hats...?

218
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,750
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro. A
120 million berry bounty.

219
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,010
"Black Foot" Sanji. A
77 million berry bounty.

220
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,060
She obtained a bounty at
the age of 8. Nico Robin.

221
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,600
An 80 million berry bounty.

222
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,420
And a cotton-candy lover--Tony Tony Chopper.

223
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
A 50 berry bounty!

224
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,570
It's too low!

225
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,990
"THE STRAW HATS" ZORO SANJI ROBIN CHOPPER

226
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,430
Who is there? Is Luffy there, too?

227
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,610
Move out of my way!

228
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,620
They're a good match for us!

229
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,600
Let's do it!

230
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Wait!

231
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,580
Why're you stopping us, Captain?

232
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,800
If we cause trouble with them,
Straw Hat Luffy won't keep quiet.

233
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,740
It's not wise to have an
unnecessary conflict before

234
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,880
we go to the New World!

235
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,770
Hey, Zoro! Sanji!

236
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,190
Robin! Wait for me!

237
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,820
What is that talking racoon?

238
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,360
Huh? What are you talking about?

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,160
Racoons can't talk...

240
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,460
But...

241
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,900
I heard that you got here first, Zoro!

242
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,000
Can't believe you didn't get lost.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,590
Sanji and Robin, you guys finally made it!

244
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
You see it?

245
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,430
Yeah, I've never seen something like that.

246
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,370
He might cause us trouble. Ignore him.

247
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,510
Oh, wait!

248
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,270
Hey, wait a minute!

249
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,480
Our target, Nico Robin,
is a Devil Fruit eater.

250
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,510
It'll be painful if she fights back.

251
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,720
Let's catch her off guard!

252
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,050
I better hurry up. I wonder
if they're all here.

253
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,620
I want Nami-san and Robin-chan
to try my improved food soon!

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,210
Before that, I better go see if
the kitchen in the Sunny is okay.

255
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,550
And then, go food shopping!

256
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,520
Is that Sanji?

257
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,550
Why don't you say something?

258
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,620
Did you hit me knowing who I was?

259
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,600
Did you see it? You made me look like a fool.

260
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,440
You humiliated me in public.

261
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,610
It shouldn't happen to me.

262
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm an elite pirate with
a 400 million bounty!

263
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,240
Kneel down on the ground in fear now

264
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
and beg for your life!

265
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,390
Just...

266
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,060
Just apologize!

267
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,990
Doesn't he wanna live?

268
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,890
I think you realize now how
audacious your actions were!

269
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,320
That's why you're so scared
that you can't even talk!

270
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,800
A few moments ago, a man who
has a long nose and a woman

271
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,960
with long hair messed with us

272
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,670
so our captain is in a bad mood.

273
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,180
You better apologize now.

274
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,560
Kneel on the ground!

275
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,000
Otherwise, you're gonna throw away
your life with just one mistake.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,310
Our captain pulls his trigger very easily.

277
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,780
Kneel on the ground already!
He's Straw Hat Luffy!

278
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,610
He wants to get killed? Apologize!

279
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm really sorry!

280
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,290
I better go now.

281
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,630
What's wrong with him?!

282
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,510
Okay!

283
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,400
Very well!

284
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,100
What?!

285
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,360
Hey, did he do something?

286
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,940
Hancock was right. I should put it on.

287
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,360
Hey, Zoro! Sanji! Robin!

288
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,920
We finally see each other
but you're acting weird!

289
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,690
Zoro and Sanji, you guys did
pretty well in these 2 years.

290
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,410
But why aren't you guys talking to me?

291
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,500
Hey, he's still following us.

292
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,670
Oh, you're being shy, you bastards!

293
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,110
And that racoon knows about us
the Straw Hats a bit too well.

294
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,260
I've been thinking about that,
too, but maybe... Look at this.

295
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,020
Don't tell me he's...!

296
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,170
The real cotton-candy lover--Chopper,
a 50 berry bounty!

297
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,150
So he's their pet!

298
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,440
You guys changed a little. But I don't care.

299
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,720
He was abandoned on this island before

300
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,700
they died and he's been living in the wild.

301
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,540
He thinks his masters are back
and that's why he's following us.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,760
Then let's get rid of that
fox and take him instead.

303
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,540
If the pet looks the same as the
poster, we'd look more authentic.

304
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,620
We're gonna keep him? What does he eat?

305
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,960
Looks like cotton candy.

306
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,050
We don't have any.

307
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,040
We don't need you anymore! Go away!

308
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,230
Come here, Chopper.

309
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,270
It's a cucumber.

310
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,440
Scary! Robin, you're scary!

311
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,070
Now is the chance!

312
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,990
Oh, Robin!

313
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,200
What? Hey, Nico Robin!

314
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,670
Who are they?

315
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,420
What a crisis! Robin has been abducted!

316
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,920
They're kidnappers!

317
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,590
Hey, shouldn't we tell Captain Luffy?

318
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,250
What?! Did you guys see Luffy already?!

319
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,390
You're right!

320
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,480
They must have new members by now, too!

321
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,390
Yeah, we better rescue Robin already, huh?

322
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,680
Take me there with you!

323
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,850
This is Sabaody! We caught Nico Robin!

324
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
With a fox kind of thing
that won't let go of her.

325
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,710
Franky was all fired up.

326
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,960
I don't have to worry about the Sunny now.

327
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,700
What I have to do is...

328
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,030
Viva Sabaody!

329
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,720
Oh no, I gotta focus on cooking!

330
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,710
I have to get the best ingredients first.

331
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,210
It's a beautiful...!

332
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,130
I need lady!

333
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,800
And cook something really good that'll
surprise Nami-san and Robin-chan!

334
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,130
But,

335
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,050
I can't find anything special.

336
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,700
What should I do...?

337
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,980
Well, you might want to check the
shop on the beach at Grove #42...

338
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,830
Oh, thank you! I appreciate it!

339
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,150
Hey, fisherman, sell me some
fish at your best price!

340
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,870
Huh? Nobody's here?

341
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,210
Hey, are you the owner?

342
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,420
What's the matter?

343
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,470
He's gone!

344
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,220
The green-haired man!

345
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Green-haired? What happened?

346
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,730
I did something horrible!
It happened just now...

347
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,660
Old man, I wanna fish.

348
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,600
Huh?

349
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,360
Young man, you don't look
like a fishing type of guy.

350
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,880
I promised to meet friends on this island

351
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,360
but I got here first and I
don't see any of them yet.

352
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,030
So I have nothing to do.

353
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,540
Can you take me out to
sea on your fishing boat?

354
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,400
Sure, I'll take you out on that
boat right there so go ahead

355
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,750
and wait for me.

356
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,050
That's what I told him.

357
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,720
Green hair, 3 swords, and a belly warmer?

358
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,530
Yeah, and he has a deep scar on his eye.

359
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,430
You know him?

360
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,600
A scar on his eye?

361
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,080
Was it this guy?

362
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,070
Oh yeah, this is the guy! Is he your friend?

363
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,360
Well, I only know him a little.

364
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,970
I told him to get on the fishing boat.

365
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,500
That's for sure.

366
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,410
But when I came back here...

367
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,880
No, young man, that's not it!

368
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,190
That's a pirate ship!

369
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,470
You guys! We're gonna set
sail for the New World

370
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,330
that we've been dreaming of!

371
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,090
W-Wake up, young man!

372
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,590
You're on the wrong ship!

373
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,960
So I think he's heading for
the Fish-Man Island like that.

374
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,270
That idiot!

375
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,090
I thought it was unlike him to show up first.

376
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,720
I knew he'd do something like this!

377
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,270
It's a pirate ship! Maybe they'll kill him!

378
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,160
No, no, it's okay. It's
not your fault at all.

379
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,770
He won't die. We're lucky
to know where he's heading.

380
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,430
That aside, can I have some fish?

381
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,160
Well, but...

382
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,550
Hey, what's that?!

383
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,630
Look at the water! Something is surfacing!

384
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,610
What is it?

385
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,020
That's huge!

386
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,570
It's a galleon ship!

387
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,810
It wasn't coated well and was
crushed by water pressure?

388
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,450
Or attacked by Sea Kings?

389
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,120
But it looks like it's been
cut by some kind of knife.

390
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,450
Don't be a fool!

391
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,790
Who could cut a ship this big?

392
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,400
You bastard!

393
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,150
How dare you ruin our dream
to go to the New World?!

394
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,700
It's a quirk of fate!

395
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,640
You should blame your own fate that

396
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,810
brought a plague onto your ship.

397
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,230
No, you're the one...

398
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,260
Look!

399
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,440
Somebody's on the ship!

400
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,900
Oh, he's back! I couldn't
care less about him.

401
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,780
I got on...

402
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,420
...the wrong ship.

403
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,710
The Straw Hats are gathering

404
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,300
on the Sunny, preparing for departure.

405
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,660
But the Marines caught wind of this,

406
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,010
and set out for the Sabaody Archipelago.

407
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,360
The opponent who cornered
Luffy & Co. two years ago

408
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,230
is targetting them again.

409
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,500
On the next episode of One Piece!

410
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,440
"The Navy Has Set Out! The
Straw Hats in Danger!"

411
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
