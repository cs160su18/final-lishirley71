2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,860
"Boss Luffy Returns! Is it a Dream
or Reality? Lottery Ruckus!"

26
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,140
This is Grand Jipang.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,920
It resembles a certain era of
a certain country quite a bit,

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,960
but, well, let's not get too specific.

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
Although there were some troubles last year

30
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,170
after some rogues wandered into this country,

31
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,400
peace reigns over this land for the most part.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,050
People are fully enjoying peace
and spending cheerful days.

33
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,010
However...

34
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,560
Idiot! Watch where you're going!

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,700
Ouch! You're the ones who bumped into me!

36
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,340
Are you okay?

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,930
Hm, yeah. Oh, shoot! I don't have time for this!

38
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,610
Come to think of it, Dr. Bluenose
hasn't shown up lately.

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,070
Yeah, I don't know what's going on,
but he seems quite busy.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,630
Hm? Who are you?

41
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,080
Y-You are...

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,730
Ah! You guys are from that clown group!

43
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,390
These guys are dangerous.
They're always hanging out with Straw Hat.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,300
What about me?!

45
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,930
You sure are making a
racket out in broad daylight!

46
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,930
What'd you come here for?

47
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,450
Straw Hat! Why are you here?!

48
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,840
What're you saying when you're
the one who came in here?

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,820
If you're here to pick a fight, I'm up for it.

50
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,240
Hey, let's get out of here.
He doesn't seem to be here anyway.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,160
Y-Yeah. Looks like we were given a bum steer.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,810
W-We're leaving now! Let's go!

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,410
Yeah.

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,460
What on earth was that?

55
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,850
Seriously, we don't get decent customers.

56
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,980
Sanji-kun! Scatter some salt!

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,030
Okay!

58
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,800
What's the deal, Onami?
Were there more annoying customers?

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,970
It's no use saying anything
to someone who's oblivious.

60
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,300
Boss. Where's your payment?

61
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,510
Oops! That's right! I have to get going!

62
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,120
Sorry! Put it on my tab!

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,670
Thanks! That was delicious!

64
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,690
Seriously... Maybe I should
report this to the police soon.

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,270
On second thought,
don't worry about it, Sanji-kun.

66
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,960
They'll keep coming back anyway.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,700
Besides, come to think of it,
salt is expensive these days.

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,400
Okay!

69
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,820
Straw Hat again?

70
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,040
W-Well, he just happened
to be in that eatery, that's all.

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,010
It's not like he's gotten in our way yet.

72
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,130
Arrrgh! How irritating!

73
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,900
Ever since we came to this town,
our earnings have dropped considerably!

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,260
Then we should go to a different town.

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
--You idiot!
--Ow!

76
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,890
How could I, the great Buggy,
just get my butt whipped and leave?!

77
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,590
Hey, who's saying I got my butt whipped?!
I never did, you bastard!

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm gonna slice you into three and eat you!

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,390
His mood is quite nasty, isn't it?

80
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,130
He's really getting into the habit of losing, so...

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,000
In any case, we'd better find him quickly

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,410
and shake him down, or we won't
be able to welcome in the new year.

83
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,580
Hey!

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,530
Orika! How's he doing?

85
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,410
Oh, hi, Boss!

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,680
He seems to be getting quite a bit better.

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,590
He ate some rice porridge earlier, too.

88
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,770
I see. That's good.

89
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,870
Orika, Pepper and the others
are worried about you.

90
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,470
Let's go and play with them.

91
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,320
Well, but...

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,130
That's fine, Rika. I'll watch pops.

93
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,360
What? What is it?

94
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah... Yeah... Okay.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,470
Pops tells me to go, too.

96
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,350
Good.

97
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,030
Hold on a minute, okay?

98
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,090
♪ It's warm on the southern islands! ♪

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,030
♪ Pineapple-ple! Their heads
are nice and warm! ♪

100
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,160
♪ They're all idiots! ♪

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,400
Next, the second verse!

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,610
Yeah!

103
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,590
♪ It's cold on the northern islands! ♪

104
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,030
♪ Freezing, real freezing!
Their heads are shivering... ♪

105
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,680
Hm?

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,070
What the heck is this?

107
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,440
Beats me.

108
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,400
A horse...? No, it's not a horse, is it?

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,150
I know what it is! It's called a camel!

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,380
He doesn't look very tasty.

111
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,710
So... what's he doing here?

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,710
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

113
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,320
He seems to have a slight fever.

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,920
Boss, could you carry him to my house?

115
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,990
I feel bad leaving him here.
He seems to be hungry, too.

116
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,010
That's no problem, but with pops, too,
your place is too small for all of you.

117
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,850
But...

118
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,000
It might be okay to just leave him by
the well at the row house on the back alley.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,600
But if he's hungry, then we should...

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,900
Hm?

121
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,150
Even so, don't just bring anything to our place!

122
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,360
We're running a business, you know?!

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, come on! Your place
is pretty empty anyway.

124
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,030
That's none of your business!

125
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,830
Dr. Bluenose isn't around when we need him.

126
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,910
You can leave things to Orika.
She's used to taking care of the sick.

127
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,790
I thought a camel would be cooler than this.

128
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,630
Me, too.

129
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,050
Boss!

130
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,230
There's trouble! There's trouble!

131
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,430
There's trouble, Boss!
Hm? What the hell is that?!

132
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,690
It's a camel.

133
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,860
Orika took him in and is nursing him.

134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,940
Orika is?!

135
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,190
More importantly, what's the
matter, Usopp? What's going on?

136
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,560
Oh, yeah! There's trouble at Orika's house!

137
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,190
--Come with me right away, Boss!
--What...?

138
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,900
At my house...

139
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, walk briskly!

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,010
To think that you were
hiding in a place like this...

141
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,320
Did you really think that you could outrun us?

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,410
Pops!

143
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,570
Please stop it. He's a sick man!

144
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,310
Shut up! He's a guarantor of a loan.
If you wanna complain,

145
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,510
do so to the guy who skipped town,
forcing the deed on him!

146
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,170
We're just collecting the money as agreed.

147
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,710
Hey, don't bother with her! Let's go!

148
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,050
--Yes, sir!
--Hold it!

149
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,510
Let go of pops!

150
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,040
You bastard! You think
you can get away with this?

151
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,540
Shut up! You guys are the ones
who're doing something terrible!

152
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,500
We've got the deed.
Come back when you get a clue!

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,950
A deed for such a large
amount can't be possible!

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,260
If you're still gonna take pops, I'll take you on!

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,550
You blockhead! There's this
thing called interest.

156
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,300
We're gonna make him work for
the rest of his life to repay us.

157
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,770
This is no time for you, a policeman, to butt in.

158
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,050
Pops!

159
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,560
Stop it! Let pops go!

160
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,880
--Orika!
--Wh-Who's this brat?

161
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,780
You had a kid?

162
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,100
Okay, then. We'll take you too and sell you off.

163
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,810
Come!

164
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,940
--Rika!
--Boss!

165
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,400
Gum-Gum...

166
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,110
...Billy Club!

167
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,840
All right, Boss!

168
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,940
D-Dammit! How dare you...?!

169
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,400
You won't get away with this!

170
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,990
Yaay! All right! Get out of
here and don't come back!

171
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,910
But this isn't good.

172
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,600
It's hard to think that clown would
back down without doing anything.

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,500
Don't worry. It'll work out okay.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,380
That sounds terrible.
So what happened to pops?

175
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,230
He's resting at home.

176
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,340
He's almost better, but he tries
to push himself and go out.

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,770
So I scolded him, saying that
he should lay down and rest.

178
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,480
You can twist even pops
around your little finger, huh?

179
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,360
Mr. Camel got his energy back!

180
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,670
Oh? Good timing. I made his food
using leftovers. You can have it.

181
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,440
Thanks, Sanji-san!

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,040
What, Sanji? Isn't my food ready yet?

183
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,180
You ate just a bit ago!

184
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,080
--Here you go!
--Thank you!

185
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,880
Whoa! You're making some tasty-looking food!

186
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,060
Ouch!

187
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,170
These are expensive dishes
for delivery, you damn jerk.

188
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,630
Don't touch them.

189
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,050
What's wrong, Mr. Camel?

190
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,070
Aren't you gonna eat? I'm sure you're hungry.

191
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,600
If you don't eat, you can't get better.

192
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,760
He doesn't want them? Then I'll...

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,640
No!

194
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,310
What's the matter?

195
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,130
Oh? What is it?

196
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,620
You bastard! I made these dishes using
expensive food! They're for delivery!

197
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,240
Hey! You bastard!

198
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,630
I'm gonna slice you into three!

199
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,410
Just as you'd expect from Sanji!

200
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,920
To think that he can make
such tasty food with leftovers!

201
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,510
You bastard! I'm mad! I'm seriously
gonna slice you into three!

202
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,630
Wait, Sanji-san! Please don't blame Mr. Camel!

203
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm sure he ate those
because they looked tastier.

204
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,800
Even so...

205
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,480
You bastard! Who do you think
you are?! You're just a camel!

206
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm sorry, Sanji-san, Onami-san.

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,610
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

208
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,920
Onami, you sure are generous today.

209
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,100
Normally, you'd have beaten
the crap out of the person by now.

210
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,290
To tell you the truth, I'm thinking this
might be some sort of turn of fate.

211
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,080
This. Take a look at this.

212
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,110
I bought a Year-End lottery ticket.

213
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,460
A lottery ticket? What does
that have to do with this?

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,720
"Camel"

215
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,500
Ah! Camel, 1356?

216
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,430
So you think it might be good luck?

217
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,600
You got it!

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,170
Today is the drawing day.

219
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,310
I asked Usopp to go there and check.

220
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,660
Third prize! Camel, 1356!

221
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,030
A million Ryo-Berry third prize?!

222
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,330
Yeah. I checked many times!
There's no mistaking it!

223
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,250
I-It's true...? It's like a dream!

224
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,860
All right! We can now welcome in
the new year without any problem!

225
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,640
We'll be out of our desperate
financial situation!

226
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,210
That's amazing!

227
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,280
Now my bills will all be wiped out, right?

228
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,380
It wasn't you who hit the lottery.

229
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,160
Thank you, camel!

230
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,470
You really were a good-luck camel!

231
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,770
I'll let you eat whatever you like,
since this is definitely thanks to you!

232
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,780
Who said you could eat the lottery ticket?!

233
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,620
Spit it out! Spit it out!
A million Ryo-Berries! Spit it out!

234
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,240
He must really like expensive stuff.

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,710
This is no time to be impressed.

236
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,820
Hey! Spit it out! A million Ryo-Berries!

237
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,570
Give it back to me at any cost!

238
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,840
Mr. Camel...

239
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,710
A good-luck camel? What a joke.

240
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,560
I came to check just in case...
They sure are connected by fate.

241
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,370
Seriously, I wish they wouldn't
pull me into things like this.

242
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,580
I don't want you to call me out so easily.

243
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,550
Well, don't be like that.

244
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,970
In order to join hands, we have to settle things.

245
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,050
I've been having a hard time with that tomboy.

246
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,050
This is a good chance.
You don't have to hold back.

247
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,510
Then, Commissioner, it's okay
to flashily get rid of Straw Hat?

248
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,230
It shouldn't be a big deal for a
policeman or two to disappear.

249
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,340
Fortunately, it's he who's at fault this time.

250
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,930
I can help you without any hesitation.

251
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,520
--Gulp.
--That's reassuring.

252
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,660
After I get rid of him, you and I will
control this town and do as we please.

253
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,290
That's right.

254
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,250
Well, then...

255
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,420
"Confectionery
Carefully Produced"

256
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,420
These are golden-colored confectioneries.

257
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,460
You're bad.

258
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,340
Not as bad as you are.

259
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,780
What's the matter, Cabaji?!

260
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,230
Well... Seems like it was my imagination.

261
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,800
Don't scare me like that, you moron-ji!

262
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,460
I-I'm sorry.

263
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,990
I'm so busy! I'm so busy!

264
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,480
Th-There's trouble! There's trouble!

265
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,960
Boss! There's trouble!

266
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,860
I sent Boss out for delivery with that camel.

267
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,790
What's the matter?

268
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,670
What bad timing! Orika got
kidnapped by the Buggy Family!

269
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,080
What?!

270
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,130
I heard that she got caught by them
out of the blue on her way home.

271
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,040
Seems like they were after Orika from the start.

272
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,660
Hey, Straw Hat.

273
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,680
Hm? Ah! You guys are...!

274
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,850
Is it really okay with you? That girl
will be sold off to repay the loan.

275
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,270
What'd you say about Orika?!

276
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,510
She should be leaving the harbor soon.

277
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,150
Shouldn't you be on your way to rescue her?

278
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,190
Let me go!

279
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,990
Give up.

280
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,530
You are an important piece
of bait to trick Straw Hat.

281
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,450
This time, we're collecting
money based on a deed.

282
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,580
If he tries to raise his hand against
me in front of the commissioner,

283
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,440
he can immediately get fired and be exiled.

284
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,390
On top of that, I'll get
money from selling you off.

285
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,470
Just you wait, Straw Hat!

286
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,220
Buggy! What're you gonna
do with Orika?! Let her go!

287
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,050
Sorry, Straw Hat. I'm taking this girl
as collateral for that man's loan.

288
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,680
There's no reason for you to butt in
this time! Mind your own business!

289
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,140
Let's go, men!

290
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,960
--Yes, sir!
--Help me, Boss!

291
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,200
I said...

292
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,320
...let her go!

293
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,050
You interfered with us, Straw Hat!

294
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,300
A policeman beating up commoners
over personal matters?

295
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,860
What's your problem?!

296
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,470
Hey, what do you think about
his act?! Commissioner?

297
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm disappointed in you, Straw Hat.

298
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,070
What have you done?

299
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,640
Ack! The commissioner?
What's he doing in a place like this?!

300
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,790
The commissioner?

301
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,050
Yeah. Just like our boss, Koza-sama,

302
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,840
he's a town commissioner and
the top person in this town.

303
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
Whoa...

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,340
To think that you'd use violence

305
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,610
towards commoners who
are not at fault like this...

306
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,920
As a commissioner, I cannot overlook this.

307
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,770
Straw Hat Luffy! I hereby strip you of
your role as policeman. You're fired!

308
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,950
Leave this country immediately
and never set foot here again!

309
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,270
--What?!
--Why?!

310
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,700
Got that, Straw Hat?!

311
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,560
It's your punishment for meddling
in our business all the time!

312
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,000
Thanks for all your hard work!

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,970
If you get it, then hurry up and leave!

314
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,830
What're you guys talking about?

315
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,290
Why do I have to leave here
just because I tried to save Orika?

316
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,660
I don't get it.

317
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,890
You're still talking like that, you blockhead?!

318
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,520
It's unseemly, Straw Hat.

319
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,380
Are you trying to talk your way out
after everything you've done?

320
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,680
I can immediately call the constables in
and have them arrest you, you know.

321
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,160
You're the one who should
be arrested, Commissioner!

322
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,850
Hm?

323
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,760
A town commissioner joining hands
with criminals? It's quite inexcusable!

324
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm removing you from your position right away!

325
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,470
What? Who are you?

326
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,180
You sure talk like a big shot.

327
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,370
Do you say that knowing that
I'm the North Town Commissioner?

328
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,030
Oh? That's...

329
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,790
How insolent! Kneel down!

330
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,460
Who do you think this is?

331
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,210
She's the daughter of Shogun Cobra! Vivi-sama!

332
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,730
Ack!

333
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,150
You're being disrespectful! Kneel down!

334
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,610
--Vivi!
--Vivi!

335
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,670
So it was really you, Vivi!

336
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,390
It's been a while, everyone.

337
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,270
B-But... what's the princess doing here?

338
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,970
My investigation has shown
that you took a bribe

339
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,070
and are working with the
clown to trick Boss Straw Hat.

340
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,450
Give up peacefully.

341
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,160
Y-Yes, ma'am!

342
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,260
Don't "Yes ma'am" her, you stupid jerk!

343
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,950
Dammit! Now that it's come
to this, I'll flashily withdraw,

344
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,470
taking the loan collateral with me!

345
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,670
--Like I said...!
--Huh?

346
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,840
Orika can't be collateral for the loan!

347
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,090
Because she isn't pops' daughter.

348
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,720
--Huh?
--This way! Hurry up!

349
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,270
She called him pops!
They're clearly father and daughter!

350
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,600
There they are! Hey, Boss! I brought him here!

351
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,690
Oh, thanks!

352
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh, hey, pops!

353
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,610
I heard you collapsed. Are you okay now?

354
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,340
Don't push yourself, pops!

355
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,280
Things just aren't the same
at Pinwheel without you!

356
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,700
--Wh-What?
--Let's have a drink together again soon, pops!

357
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,700
In this town, everyone calls him "pops."

358
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,420
There's nothing odd about
Orika calling him that, right?

359
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,200
But he was sleeping at her house!

360
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,120
Pops made his cold worse and
collapsed the other day on the street.

361
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,530
And Orika happened to pass by.

362
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,140
She's the kind of girl who can't
just leave someone like that.

363
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,000
Then this girl has nothing to do with the loan!

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,950
I told you so!

365
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,320
Which means that...

366
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,820
You're just a kidnapper!

367
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Shock!

368
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,660
Mom!

369
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,960
Rika!

370
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,210
You get it now? Then I'm
gonna do it this year again.

371
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,500
Time to get blown away, Buggy!

372
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,590
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

373
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,000
Good job, guys!

374
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,020
Our lord's pet?! This camel is?!

375
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,600
That's right. Lashes has been lost for a while,
so we've all been looking for him.

376
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,990
The reward is a million Ryo-Berries.

377
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,440
What?!

378
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,100
Vivi! You don't mean...

379
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,210
Yes, we'll definitely pay the reward.

380
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,120
Ahhh! All right!

381
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,830
Since this is becoming a routine,
it's hard to tell you this,

382
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,950
but isn't it Orika who deserves the credit?

383
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,830
That's okay. Let's share it. We all
took care of him, so... Right, Mom?

384
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,140
Yeah, you're right.

385
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,920
Geez... I love you, Orika!

386
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,760
Okay, then! Let's have some fun today!

387
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,790
We'll celebrate pops'
complete recovery as well!

388
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,100
Come to think of it, what're these decorations?

389
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,510
You don't know?! Today's called
Christmas Eve in foreign countries,

390
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,230
and it's a joyous day.

391
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,700
It's nice to be cheery like
this once in a while, right?

392
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,940
I see...

393
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,200
Say, Onami-san. Can I ask you a favor?

394
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,260
--What is it?
--Orika took in someone who
collapsed on the street again.

395
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,580
We've already brought him here and
he's outside. Can we bring him inside?

396
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,370
Collapsed on the street?

397
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,090
I'm starving...

398
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,620
Hey, monk. If a foreign celebration is
okay with you, why don't you come in?

399
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,930
We've got lots of yummy food.

400
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,010
Yeah, sounds good.

401
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,530
All right, then! Let's really
whoop it up, shall we?!

402
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,500
Come to think of it, where's Dr. Bluenose?

403
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,780
Seems like he's still busy.

404
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,980
Since he can understand animal languages,

405
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,030
Lashes' problem could've been solved
right away if he had been around.

406
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,200
Now that you mention it, you're right.

407
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm telling you, today is a
really busy day for reindeers!

408
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,550
Boss! There's trouble! There's trouble!

409
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,200
For some reason, there's always trouble!

410
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,430
Oh, eat a rice cake or something
and calm down, Usopp.

411
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,390
This is about rice cakes!

412
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,930
They're gonna have a
rice cake tossing event at the castle,

413
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,940
and one of them will have
an amazing treasure inside!

414
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,700
I wonder how big of an uproar it'll cause!

415
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,920
Oh, that. Our lord is asking us to protect it.

416
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,400
Oh, that'd be a lot of work. Hey, we are?!

417
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

418
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,070
"A Big Rice Cake Tossing Race
at the Castle! Red Nose's Plot"

419
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,670
I'm gonna be a policeman!!
