The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

something - that's the treasure

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,480
Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

We are the one! Go ahead!

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,130

Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,240
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,320
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

74
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,220
When Luffy found out that the prize for a fighting event
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,130
he decided to enter and fight fierce battles
against other tough contenders from the New World.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,270
Premier Hachis Hash!

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,140
Pentachromatic Strings!

78
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,110
Overheat!

79
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,380
Room!

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
Law, eh?

81
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,750
Everyone!

82
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,320
I want you to take him
and head for Zou!

83
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,560
The Navy ship is flying towards us!

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,800
Doflamingo is coming from that way!

85
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,670
Meteorites?!

86
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,470
Room!

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey, Law!

88
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,040
I realize we have
to carry Caesar as far as possible.

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,510
It's clear we have to leave here now.

90
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,350
But I thought Dressrosa was just a waypoint.

91
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,850
Our main purpose was killing Kaido of the Four Emperors,
wasn't it?

92
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,490
Aren't you getting too hung up
on Doflamingo?

93
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,700
Get ready for Coup de Burst!

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,100
I'm afraid that I have to break up my alliance
with the Straw Hats now.

95
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
When I joined forces with them,

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,410
my only purpose was to use them
to stop the manufacture of SMILEs.

97
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,220
Even if I can't kill you right now,

98
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,660
Kaido will kill you sooner or later
once you lose all the SMILEs.

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,990
I see.

100
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,130
So you're gonna sacrifice
yourself to kill me.

101
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,370
I want to see how the world falls into a mess
after you die,

102
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,000
but more importantly,
I want to make you pay for what you did 13 years ago.

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,940
Joker!

104
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,150
"Rebecca's Special Attack!
Back-to-the-Water Dance!"

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,100
You want to make me pay?
For what I did 13 years ago?

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,640
You know what I'm talking about.

107
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,910
What are you gonna do with Giolla?

108
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,080
You know what kind of family we are.

109
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,750
He's right, Law!
I don't mind sacrificing myself for the Young Master!

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,690
You better run as far as you can.

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm not gonna leave
the Young Master and run!

112
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,790
I don't need you.

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,700
I don't need you here. Just go.

114
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,970
Y-Yes, sir!

115
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,110
I saw Black Foot earlier.

116
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,010
Which means our plan is not going so well.

117
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,690
You lost your trump card, Caesar.

118
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,960
You will lose the SMILE factory
while you're fighting me here.

119
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,940
This will be your end.

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,040
It is unreasonable for you to hold a grudge against me,
Law!

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,610
It's not a grudge.

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,990
I've been living my life until today...

123
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,990
...to attain that man's
long-cherished ambition!

124
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,160
OFF THE COAST OF DRESSROSA

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,340
We barely got away
from Doflamingo but...

126
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,270
...will Tra-guy be okay?

127
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,280
Hey, guys!
Are you keeping a lookout?

128
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,580
This is Brook here! It looks all serene
from a 45-degree angle!

129
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,220
You gotta look in all directions!

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,420
All right, ma'am!
A 360-degree spin!

131
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,600
I see some clouds now.

132
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,400
I can't believe that guy can move through the air
by attaching strings to clouds!

133
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,840
Brook!
Don't miss even a slight movement.

134
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,710
Oh, I don't know
since my eyes are like...

135
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,710
...knotholes!

136
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,520
If he comes flying towards us again,
I'll generate strong wind and blow the clouds away!

137
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,020
Then he can't chase us.

138
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,090
That's a good idea.
Only Nami-san could've come up with it.

139
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,870
But I wonder if it's really okay for us to head to Zou
like Law told us.

140
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:38,370
We were under attack by the Navy and Doflamingo
at that moment so we needed to get away but...

141
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,810
In any case, you guys gotta protect Robin-chan
even if it costs your life! Okay?

142
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,310
Clank.

143
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,410
How were they?

144
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,420
My precious Robin-chan is
with Franky and Usopp.

145
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,960
Then, if Zoro and Kin'emon can meet Luffy,
everything's okay, right?

146
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,800
Yeah, but Zoro is bad at directions.
I don't know if he can make it to the Colosseum.

147
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
Well, Kin'emon's with him so he'll be fine.

148
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,440
I wonder if Tra-guy is okay.

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,440
His plan was not to kill Doflamingo
but let Kaido of the Four Emperors take care of him.

150
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,080
As long as he focuses on getting away,
he'll be fine.

151
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,410
Uh-huh.

152
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,550
What's the matter, Momo?
You turned into a dragon, again.

153
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,590
I-I thought back and I can't stop shaking.

154
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,260
That man who flies...

155
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,760
You mean Doflamingo.

156
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,030
I saw him
the last time I came to Dressrosa.

157
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,370
What?

158
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,210
Young Master, you're gonna kill him!

159
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
What's your problem?

160
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,050
Who are you?
You're a gladiator, aren't you?

161
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,530
Who wants to see
you guys running around?

162
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:12,300
If you can't chop anybody up,
at least get yourself sliced and show people your blood!

163
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,940
No matter how great
his or her personality is,

164
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,340
every human has a cruel side
and they all get excited when they see blood.

165
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,910
Blood and death.

166
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,880
That's entertainment!

167
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,050
Pull yourself together!

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,460
What a bunch of scum.

169
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,040
Don't let them fight like that again.

170
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,270
Y-Yes, Young Master!

171
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,810
Kin'emon! Momonosuke!

172
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,680
Oh, Kanjuro!

173
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,380
I found a harbor.
Let's steal a ship there.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,450
This country is too dangerous!

175
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,690
I just realized Kanjuro is held captive
by that horrible man

176
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,360
and I can't stop worrying.

177
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,470
I hope you're all right, Kanjuro!

178
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,040
Why are you looking like that?!

179
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,110
Depends on what they want
from you guys

180
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,650
but often, hostages wouldn't be treated so badly
so he's gonna be alright.

181
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,850
You're not really concerned!
You're thinking about something else, aren't you?!

182
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,820
Oh, which reminds me,
Violet-chan said she'd be alright, too!

183
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,260
I'll be alright.

184
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,530
I talked to my friend
and the Government will protect me.

185
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,730
Really?

186
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,140
Yes. I guess they've arrived at the harbor
to pick me up by now.

187
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,270
Believe me.

188
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,310
Okay. It's too bad
that I can't come with you

189
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,510
but as long as you're safe...

190
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,720
Thank you.
I think I can go on thanks to you.

191
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,920
Well... But if you wanna thank me,
you can kiss me on my cheek...

192
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,190
Oh no!
Your ship is getting attacked by the Fighting Fish!

193
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,130
What is a Fighting Fish?

194
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,530
You better go help them!

195
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,640
Nami-san!

196
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,890
--Damn, Rebecca, that little bitch!
--She's so persistent as always!

197
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,800
Just go to hell already, you little tramp!

198
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,200
Horse-san!

199
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,140
Yes?

200
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,070
Take me to the palace!

201
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,410
Okay!

202
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,440
DRESSROSA - THE CORRIDA COROSSEUM

203
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,410
V-V-V...

204
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,210
Vice Captain!

205
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,080
What? Vice Captain?
What are you talking about?

206
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,480
Y-Y-You're Zoro-senpai, aren't you?

207
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,450
Luffy-senpai's right-hand man?

208
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,120
What? Well...

209
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,920
Looks like you're not
disguising yourself too well.

210
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,390
Let me just say this. I'm not Zoro!

211
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,130
Y-You don't have to hide it!

212
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,600
I also know Luffy-senpai is fighting in this Colosseum
under the name "Lucy"!

213
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,010
What?!

214
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,810
I-I-I'm talking
to Zoro-senpai like it's nothing!

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,420
I-I'm so thrilled!

216
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,590
Why are you crying?!

217
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,390
How do you know
about Luffy and my name?!

218
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,540
I'be albayz bween your ban!

219
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,070
Huh?
He can't even have a conversation.

220
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,410
I gotta say it!
I finally get to meet him!

221
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,780
A-A-Auto...

222
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,690
--Stop crying!
--Y-Yes!

223
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,220
I just got scolded by Zoro-senpai!

224
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,690
C-Can I have your autograph?!

225
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,700
--I said it!
--My autograph?

226
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,230
If I bring Luffy-senpai here,
can I have your autograph?

227
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,840
You can do that for me?
I'll be counting on you!

228
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,240
H-He just said
he'll be counting on me, didn't he?

229
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,980
Zoro-senpai said he'll be counting on me!

230
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,790
Why do you have to cry again?

231
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,190
What are you doing?! Just go!

232
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,960
Th-Th...

233
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,160
Th?

234
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,160
Then!

235
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,070
Wait for me there!

236
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,470
I'm gonna bring him at the risk of my life!

237
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,570
He doesn't have to risk his life for it...

238
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,680
Z-Zoro-senpai said
he'll be counting on me!

239
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,490
H-He's really trusting me!

240
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,120
It feels like...

241
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,160
...I became the right-hand man of
Luffy-senpai's right-hand man!

242
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
It's great!

243
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,130
It's amazing!

244
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,140
I've got to do this right!

245
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,480
The battle royal at the Corrida Colosseum!

246
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
The heated match of Block D!

247
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,750
Tough contenders are attacking fiercely
and the others are getting eliminated one after another!

248
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,790
The one that's standing out among them is...

249
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,300
...the military captain of the Scorchistan -
Rolling Logan!

250
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,670
ROLLING LOGAN - A MILITARY CAPTAIN OF
SOUTHERN KINGDOM OF SCORCHISTAN

251
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,910
Let's see what happens if I go all out!

252
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,320
Let's see what happens if I roll!

253
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,700
What you're seeing is
what Rolling Logan is famous for!

254
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,500
It's a special attack - Rolling Cradle!

255
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,480
With that high-speed rolling,
his enemy's equilibrium gets thrown off!

256
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,250
And his finishing move is...

257
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,380
Let's see!

258
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,950
The Leg Split!

259
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,060
The crowds are getting all excited!

260
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,500
Oh? On the other hand...

261
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,950
They're fighting quietly
in contrast to Logan's showy style!

262
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,360
This is the great example of
ill weeds growing apace!

263
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,930
The cursed princess - Rebecca!

264
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,700
The crowd is jeering loudly!

265
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,230
You can do better than that
as a human!

266
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,830
Bring out all your power!

267
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,440
Get up, Rebecca!

268
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,480
I don't wanna do it anymore!

269
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,380
I don't wanna hurt anybody!

270
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,280
Even if you don't want to do so,

271
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,990
you have to become stronger,
Rebecca!

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,170
Soldier-san!

273
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,120
Y-You tramp!

274
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,190
Dammit! She's so persistent!

275
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,990
That's Rebecca's favorite move -
the Back-to-the-Water Dance!

276
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,800
You have to become stronger,
Rebecca!

277
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,470
She takes advantage of her
opponents' advancing momentum

278
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,640
and draws them to the edge of the ring.

279
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,770
Then she holds her sword in front of her
with her back against the water.

280
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,740
Finally, she moves unbelievably fast
utilizing her opponents' moves

281
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,710
and lets them fall into the water!

282
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,300
That's it!
That is her Back-to-the-Water Dance!

283
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:50,040
Yes! Remarkably, Rebecca has never hurt anybody
in all the battles that she took part in!

284
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,440
I didn't know
she used the Observation Haki!

285
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,410
Haki?

286
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,410
She has also never been
wounded by anybody

287
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,980
and she won it all by letting opponents fall out of the ring!
She has never been defeated!

288
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,220
She's quite a fighter!
Go, Rebecca!

289
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,690
Her fighting style is not unbeautiful

290
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,730
and I don't dislike it to be honest!

291
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,450
But would it work in this competition?!

292
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,150
Tough contenders from various countries
all have different fighting style!

293
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,560
They're not your ordinary gladiator!

294
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's see what happens
if I break your bones!

295
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,840
Ill Weed-chan!
