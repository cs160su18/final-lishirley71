2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,930
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,450
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,310
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,170
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,530
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,450
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,660
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,540
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,040
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,010
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,730
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,190
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,280
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,960
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,420
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,990
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,110
My treasure?

44
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,750
If you want it, you can have it!

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,700
Find it!

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,960
I left everything this world
has to offer there!

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,910
And so men rushed onto theGrand Line

48
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,920
in pursuit of romanticism!

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,220
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,100
Now, come on board, Franky...

51
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,930
Board my ship.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,430
Don't be so cocky!

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,580
I guess I don't have much choice
but to help you guys out!

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,110
I, Franky, will be the shipwright on your ship!

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,370
Hey! Rejoice!

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,110
It's me!

57
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,700
Although we said all sorts of things
to each other, we're friends!

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,620
I'll let these little things go!

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,400
Stop...

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,830
joking.

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,080
If that's what you want...

62
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,570
...let me say one last thing.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,630
You guys...

64
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,930
I'm sorry!

65
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm sorry for being bullheaded!

66
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,350
I was wrong!

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,690
Usopp!

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,730
Luffy...

69
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,970
You idiot!

70
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,340
Grab my hand already!

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,770
What do you think about this
for the ship's name, Franky?

72
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,180
The pirate ship...

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,220
...Thousand Sunny!

74
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,930
Coup de Burst!

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,980
It consumes three barrels of cola,

76
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,530
but it lets us fly one kilometer.

77
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,250
There's nothing the Going Merry
could do that this ship can't.

78
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,210
It exceeds the Merry in every way.

79
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,080
But the Merry's brave soul will be

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,320
inherited by the Thousand Sunny.

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,840
Yeah!

82
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,200
Well then, once again...

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,580
To Robin and Usopp, who came back to us,

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,100
to our new friend, Franky...

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,500
...and to our pirate ship, the Thousand Sunny!

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,890
Cheers!

87
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,100
Cheers!

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,190
Let's go!

89
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,230
Our next destination is Fishman Island!

90
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,260
Yeah!

91
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,170
Don't, Vigaro...!

92
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,360
Papa, are you looking at your
collection by yourself again?

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,420
Yeah.

94
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,390
Is everyone already here?

95
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,860
You were awfully quick.

96
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,100
We're going to get started
on the preparations now.

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,730
I'll make sure that you have
a special birthday, Papa.

98
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,520
Swap out with me, Jiro.

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,950
Go get some sleep.

100
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,180
I'll keep an eye on the captain.

101
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,020
"The Mysterious Band of Pirates!
Sunny and the Dangerous Trap"

102
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,880
Ah, this is bliss!

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,310
Pure bliss!

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,440
Nothing beats bathing in a massive
tub that sways on the waves!

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,020
Whee!

106
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,950
This here is my room.

107
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,700
"What seems to be the problem?"

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,660
Just kidding!

109
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm so excited!

110
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,240
I wonder if I'll
get a patient anytime soon.

111
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,400
I caught something!

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,500
Looks like I got a cool shark!

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,060
Put it in! Put it in!

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,140
Let's put it in the aquarium!

115
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,230
Put it in!

116
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,100
In ya go!

117
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,800
Yay!

118
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,390
They dropped in another one.

119
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,140
Isn't it a shark?

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,060
Well?

121
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,910
Isn't this a nice room?

122
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,220
The room's great,

123
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,020
but I can't believe those
idiots tossed in a shark!

124
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,140
Great!

125
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,040
Now let's go see it!

126
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,580
Let's check out the aquarium!

127
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,790
Hey!

128
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,410
Did a shark come in?

129
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,960
It's an awesome one with horns!

130
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,160
Yes, it did, but you've lost all
of the other fish you caught.

131
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,870
Think about compatibility
before you throw something in!

132
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,240
Isn't that a no-brainer?

133
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,730
Darn it!

134
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,890
This punk's gonna be tonight's dinner!

135
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,480
Sanji, roast it!

136
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,890
We'll barbecue that stupid shark!

137
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,040
Wait, you amateur!

138
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
It's still a fresh fish.

139
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,530
I should either make sushi or serve it
boiled with a hot and sour miso sauce.

140
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,820
Tempura might be nice, too.

141
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,010
I'm starting to get hungry!

142
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,400
But seriously, thank you
for this great ship, Franky!

143
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,410
It's no biggie!

144
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,150
But you still haven't seen
its true power yet.

145
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,790
Its true power?

146
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,610
Yeah!

147
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,800
This ship's key features are
its "Soldier Dock System."

148
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,080
There are five docks ranging from
Channel 0 to Channel 4 located on the bilge.

149
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,890
Each dock is rigged to
handle different situations.

150
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,090
All of them will play a unique role
in assisting the Thousand Sunny!

151
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,270
Wow!

152
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,650
Then lemme see them in action!

153
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,320
Hey, hold your horses.

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,900
I'll let you see them as they're needed.

155
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,740
It'd be a shame to show them off all at once.

156
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,970
I can hardly wait.

157
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,690
That was a great bath!

159
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,380
I thought it seemed a lot colder
than yesterday, and I was right!

160
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,710
I wonder if we've entered
a winter island's currents.

161
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,450
But Kokoro-san never mentioned
anything about this...

162
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,130
It's snowing?

163
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,560
Yay, it's snowing!

164
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,210
Yahoo!

165
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,210
Sweet!

166
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,900
Hey, Zoro!

167
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,300
You're spoiling the party!

168
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,610
This is how you're supposed
to act when it snows:

169
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,910
"Guys, it's snowing!"

170
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,060
I guess you still didn't know that.

171
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,440
Damn it...!

172
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,200
You really aren't that bright!

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,950
Dumb-dumb!

174
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,650
Nothing ticks me off more than
having them call me names!

175
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,390
Wow!

176
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,820
I haven't seen snow in ages.

177
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,350
I wonder if it'll stick.

178
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,160
I hope it does!

179
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,570
Maybe I should make something
warm for dinner tonight.

180
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
Hey, there's a ship!

181
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Something seems a bit off.

182
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,830
It seems off?

183
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,820
How so?

184
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,530
What gives?

185
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,210
It doesn't have any sails,
let alone an ensign.

186
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,490
It doesn't have any sails?

187
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,710
That means it's just floating there!

188
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,260
It's either a ship in distress, or it's a...

189
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,450
Come to think of it,

190
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,260
some pirates play a nasty game
called the "Davy Back Fight."

191
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,540
Yeah, we know.

192
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,180
You don't think...

193
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,000
they fell victim to that game, do you?

194
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,840
Just a sec!

195
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,150
Some people just came out.

196
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,550
Fishing?!

197
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,780
They must be in distress.

198
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,140
They look horribly exhausted.

199
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
Hey, Captain!

200
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,450
Yeah, let's go check on them.

201
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,100
If they end up being our enemy,
we'll just send them flying!

202
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,750
There aren't any fish out there that'll
bite a hook without bait, are there?

203
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't say that.

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,710
Don't even say that...

205
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,170
It beats doing nothing.

206
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,270
We've got time to kill,
so let's be patient and wait.

207
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,400
Wha--?!

208
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,660
Hey, are you guys all right?!

209
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,470
P-Pirates!

210
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,280
Pirates!

211
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,940
What?!

212
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,750
M-Make a break for it!

213
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,670
The rudder doesn't work!

214
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,500
And we don't have any sails!

215
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,160
Please show mercy!

216
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,610
What's up?

217
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,160
Dang, both you and your ship are
in sorry shape! You're both a mess!

218
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,630
Who are you guys?

219
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,650
W-We're just humble fishermen.

220
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,510
Fishermen?

221
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,670
Yeah.

222
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,640
About three days ago, we were
attacked by an unidentified ship.

223
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,040
Not only did they steal all
of our valuables and food,

224
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,330
but they also trashed our sail
and destroyed our rudder.

225
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,870
We've been floating out here ever since!

226
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,530
So you've got nothing to gain by attacking us.

227
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,560
No worries there!

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,440
Long story short, all of
you are hungry, right?

229
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,990
We were just about to eat, so come join us.

230
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,060
What?!

231
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,140
Are you serious?

232
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,050
Are you sure?

233
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,120
Yeah!

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,750
My cook can't turn a blind
eye to guys like you.

235
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,430
Don't be strangers!

236
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,170
Hey, Sanji!

237
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,380
Is it ready yet?

238
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,400
We're starving!

239
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,470
Yeah, it's just about ready,

240
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
but first...

241
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,220
Chopper!

242
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,020
You've been dying to get some patients.

243
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,110
Go tend to them.

244
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,600
S-Sure...

245
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,330
For starters, let's have
anyone injured come see me!

246
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,120
What?!

247
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
Is anyone too badly hurt to move?

248
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,250
Their pet just talked!

249
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm not a pet!

250
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,090
I'm a pirate, too!

251
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,030
I'm worth a whopping 50 Berries! Damn it!

252
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,530
Ouch!

253
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,810
Sit still.

254
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,610
I suppose these are rookie
pirates who just hit the seas

255
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,910
with their new ship and stars still in their eyes.

256
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,120
Click.

257
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,020
Hello?

258
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,470
It's me.

259
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,420
How do things look over there?

260
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,880
Oh, hello.

261
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,060
To be honest, we're in the middle
of winning a pirate crew over...

262
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,610
uh, sir.

263
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,320
Hmph!

264
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,680
So what does their
Jolly Roger look like?

265
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,040
Uh, it's a skull wearing a straw hat, I believe.

266
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,370
Come again.

267
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,680
It's not like you'd go hunting
for bugs out on the ocean.

268
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,310
What could they be thinking?

269
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,180
Don't make small talk with me!

270
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,470
I'm sorry about that.

271
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,920
N-Now listen to me carefully!

272
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,070
Those are the Straw Hats,

273
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,410
with a total bounty of
600 million Berries on their heads!

274
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,180
600 million, sir?!

275
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,490
That's right!

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,890
You know what you must do, don't you?

277
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,500
Yes, all too well...

278
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,240
Listen, don't you dare let
them escape before we arrive!

279
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,320
Click.

280
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,550
600 million Berries on their heads...?

281
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,500
Good!

282
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,620
This is too good, Mister Eyebrow!

283
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,810
Seriously!

284
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,370
It's so good it's making me cry!

285
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,720
Are they crying drunks?

286
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,770
Wow!

287
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,600
You ladies sure are cute!

288
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,570
Sure are!

289
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,420
You're so cute you're making me cry!

290
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,840
So it would seem.

291
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,300
And they were late to notice us!

292
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,810
There...

293
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,620
Excuse me!

294
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,860
Huh?

295
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,360
Didn't you leave to eat?

296
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,220
What's the matter?

297
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,070
Doctor, please!

298
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,760
Doctor, after seeing what you can do,

299
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,020
there is someone else I'd like you to see.

300
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,850
Could you follow me aboard our ship right now?

301
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,250
What?

302
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,730
What?!

303
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,180
You're headed straight
for the New World?!

304
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,500
No one will think any less of you!

305
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,060
Turn around now!

306
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,790
It's hell over there.

307
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,120
What?

308
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,610
Have you been there?

309
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,900
N-No...

310
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,950
Uh, we've only heard rumors...

311
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,570
Supposedly it's a horrible place!

312
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,390
Stupid!

313
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,290
I don't care what the rumors claim.

314
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,980
I'll find out for myself if it's
like hell when I get there.

315
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,400
What was that?

316
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,550
Oh, sorry about that!

317
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,640
It looks like you've been
looking after my men for me!

318
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,500
Please let show you my gratitude!

319
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,050
I'm their commander.

320
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,370
The name's Stansen.

321
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,480
It's my best brew,
which I had specially ordered!

322
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,380
Please help yourselves.

323
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,050
Yeah?

324
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,900
Do you really have a patient down here?

325
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,930
Whoa, there.

326
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,410
Where does
he think he's taking me?

327
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,270
I-Is that the patient?

328
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah.

329
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,440
His entire body is seriously injured.

330
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,450
It's been days since the
last time he was conscious...

331
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,830
Please, Doctor!

332
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,270
You've got to help him get better!

333
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,540
What the heck?!

334
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,760
This is horrible!

335
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,450
His wounds are festering!

336
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,670
Why did you let him get this bad?!

337
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,540
It's not like I had a choice...

338
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,070
It's not safe to move him!

339
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,010
I'm going to begin the
operation right now.

340
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,570
This has a unique flavor.

341
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,370
So you had booze, even though
you didn't have anything to eat!

342
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,420
Pretty much!

343
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,230
But, wow, this is good!

344
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,330
It's like finding a port in a storm!

345
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,510
We really ought to do more to thank you!

346
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,630
Don't sweat it!

347
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,030
That isn't an option!

348
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,970
You really must drop by our port

349
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,680
so we can thank you properly.

350
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,540
"Drop by our port"?

351
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,890
In other words, you want us
to take you there, right?

352
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,840
You caught on?

353
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,090
Good guess!

354
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,860
You're one funny man!

355
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,190
All right, we'll take ya.

356
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,260
Really?!

357
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,850
I appreciate it!

358
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,300
Wait, Luffy!

359
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,980
What about Fishman Island?

360
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,530
If we visit any of the other islands,
it'll change our log's course.

361
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,200
Won't it be fine if we leave
as soon as we drop them off?

362
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,930
C'mon! What's the big deal?

363
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,730
They're in need of help!

364
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,110
Man, I'm glad you have such
an understanding captain!

365
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,180
Well, I'm counting on you to get us there!

366
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,800
You know, they say that the people
you travel with make the journey.

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,150
So I'd say we're due for another "cheers"!

368
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,470
Yeah, sounds good!

369
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,190
Cheers!

370
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,530
You have a hilarious captain.

371
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,250
How is he, Doctor?

372
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,950
I've done everything I can.

373
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,860
Now all we can do now is wait.

374
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,840
Thank you, Doctor!

375
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,610
We can't let our guard down.

376
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,780
He isn't over the worst of it yet.

377
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,780
What should we do?

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,520
Isn't it obvious?

379
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,810
We've got to do it!

380
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm not excited about this...

381
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,320
They were such considerate guys, you know?

382
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,730
True enough!

383
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,570
And the girls were cute.

384
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,100
How could you say that?!

385
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,050
We don't have a choice in the matter!

386
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,100
He's right!

387
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,010
If we lay claim to this amazing ship, I bet we could take them on!

388
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,290
Not happening!

389
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,180
We are going to hand this ship over to them.

390
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,840
We are merely going to carry out
whatever missions they assign to us.

391
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
How could you call this a "mission"?!

392
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,480
Count us out!

393
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,820
We're going to steal this ship
and prepare to strike back.

394
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,360
As things stand now, Vigaro will
never be able to rest in peace!

395
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,070
Hey, punks!

396
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,140
You're free to argue
amongst yourselves...

397
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,770
...but I don't like the direction
this conversation's going.

398
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,820
W-Weren't you sound asleep?!

399
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,650
The smell of anesthesia was so
strong that I couldn't fall asleep.

400
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,930
You ruined my cuisine with that nasty drug!

401
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,370
You better be prepared to
pay for what you've done.

402
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,680
The three of them can
handle this on their own...

403
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,700
Happy birthday!

404
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,100
Click.

405
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,290
What is it?

406
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,570
I have managed to successfully
drive the prey into a tight corner.

407
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,240
Oh?

408
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,090
Some rookies are currently
onboard their ship right now.

409
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,460
Them?

410
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,700
They've proven surprisingly useful.

411
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,740
Sir, if I may be so bold,
it's still too soon to say.

412
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,640
After all, they have hooked a rather large fish.

413
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,670
A large fish?

414
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,740
Yes, sir!

415
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,770
Monkey D. Luffy and his
Straw Hat Pirates.

416
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,110
Their total bounty comes to 660 million Berries!

417
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,210
My, my.

418
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,240
How appropriate
for such a splendid day.

419
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,770
Indeed!

420
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,980
It certainly is!

421
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,700
Well, I'm counting on you.

422
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,080
Sir! You can leave this to me!

423
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,830
But honestly, you know, this really--

424
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,940
Click.

425
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,320
I expect this to turn into quite the party.

426
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,770
Isn't it troublesome when
you have unexpected guests?

427
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,730
I can deal with guests!

428
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,030
Hey, aren't we completely
surrounded by Navy ships?

429
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,130
You seem somewhat happy.

430
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,820
I'll show you this ship's super powers!

431
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,330
On the next episode of One Piece!

432
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,830
"Sunny's in a Pinch!
Roar, Secret Super-Speed Mecha"

433
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,250
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
