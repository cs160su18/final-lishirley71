2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,030
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,400
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,260
He and the Whitebeards finally got over the
encircling walls to make it to the scaffold!

62
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,080
As an all-out battle between the Navy and
the Whitebeards continues at the Oris Plaza,

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,460
Luffy runs toward Ace!

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,380
If you wanna see the future,
I'll show you now, Whitebeard!

65
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,130
Do it!

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,470
Ace!

67
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,560
It's no use!

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,690
Do you think that I can't
stop you for doing it?!

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,790
Don't do it!!

70
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,060
Hey, was that...?!

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,890
Conqueror's... Haki!

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,310
Hey, come on! For real?!

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,900
That was surprising!

74
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,370
That brat...

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,330
"The Scaffold at Last! The
Way to Ace Has Opened!"

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,010
Yeah! Ace is alive!

77
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,430
Hey, stay with me!

78
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,680
Was that Ace's brother?!

79
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,100
--Look at this!
--I almost passed out!

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,190
Like Pops and "Red-Haired,"
he used the Conqueror's Haki!

81
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,280
Was he the one who did it?

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,700
Seems like he used it unconsciously.

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,660
I didn't know that  he had
such tremendous power!

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,170
He was born with it as I thought!

85
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,760
He uses it, too!

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,350
Back down if your heart is weak!

87
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,060
He is not just another rookie!

88
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,340
Conqueror's Haki!

89
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,230
But it's not surprising because he's
the son of the revolutionary--Dragon!

90
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,520
Vice Admiral Doberman!

91
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,440
Hey, where did you get the power from?!

92
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,110
Huh?! What power?!

93
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,320
Never mind!

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,960
He's not aware of it!

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,990
So it's not ready to be used!

96
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,660
But it's no wonder that he attracts people!

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,530
This is why they say "blood
will tell," Dragon!

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,970
Don't let him escape this battlefield! If
you do, he'll prove a formidable foe for us!

99
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,530
Make sure he dies!

100
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,420
You Navy soldiers are a bunch of cowards!

101
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,000
You need such strength to fight a fledgling?!

102
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,050
I thought you wanted to kill me!

103
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,390
Let's get Whitebeard first!

104
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,680
He's a monster but he's wounded
badly! Bring him down at any cost!

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,560
Bring it on!

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,770
We're gonna back Pops up!

107
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,910
Don't be afraid! Get him!

108
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,990
Straw boy, now is the chance!

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,370
Don't let Straw Hat go!

110
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,820
Damn! Navy soldiers have started regrouping!

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,350
--Push it through by force?
--I wonder how long he can hang on!

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Pops!

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,790
Pops!

114
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,120
Damn! If I could only take these off!

115
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,000
Pops! Don't push yourself
too far, you're wounded!

116
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,260
You guys!

117
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Pops?!

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,050
From now on, back Straw Hat Luffy up...

119
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,440
...with all your strength!

120
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,030
Ace's brother?!

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,530
Pops!

122
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,910
Take care of Straw Hat right now!

123
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,500
Straw boy! Watch out!

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,420
You're...

125
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,970
...the allied pirate of Whitebeard
- Bohemian Knight Doma!

126
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,640
Nice to meet you, Vice Admiral Momonga!

127
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
DeCalvan Brothers!

128
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,900
--You got to fight...!
--...Against us!

129
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,150
"Thunder Lord" McGuy

130
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,780
I need you to fight me,
Vice Admiral Doberman!

131
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,110
I-Is this...?!

132
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,490
We pirates from the New
World will assist you!

133
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,410
Ace-chan's right there! Let's go, Straw Hat!

134
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,880
The allied pirates of Whitebeard
are surrounding Straw Hat!

135
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,510
--What are they doing?!
--Hurry up, Ace's brother!

136
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,890
Navy forces are focusing on Pops now!

137
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,980
This is your only chance
to get beyond the admirals!

138
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,360
Let's break through all
at once! Come with us!

139
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,840
This is a big deal, Straw boy!

140
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,820
The world's greatest pirate
is putting you to the test!

141
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Huh?

142
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,160
Heehaw!

143
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,870
Whitebeard put all his hopes
on you! That's a big thing!

144
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,540
Are you ready to respond
to his expectations?!

145
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't know what Whitebeard wants!

146
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,300
But I came here for...

147
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,010
...only one reason, right from the start!

148
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,060
The pirates are gaining vigor!

149
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,310
They're gonna break through!
We need more troops!

150
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,160
Vice Admiral-dono!  Let's
get Straw Hat first...!

151
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,380
Wait!

152
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,650
They left Whitebeard alone!
Attack Whitebeard now!

153
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,570
If we can bring Whitebeard
down, we can stop all of them!

154
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,250
They think that they can beat me
if they attack me all at one time!

155
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,260
Whitebeard! Is he invincible?!

156
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,350
Do it, brat!

157
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,940
You just stopped them from
executing Ace on my behalf!

158
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,480
You have the middle initial D,

159
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,280
so show me how the world
will be in years to come!

160
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,490
That's...

161
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,870
"Hawk-Eye!"

162
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,870
Heads up, Straw boy!

163
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,460
What are you...?!

164
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,300
It's the president's order! We consider
the Navy as our enemy for now! Go!

165
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,300
You're Daz Bonez, aren't you?

166
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,930
Straw boy!

167
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,110
Crocodile!

168
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,070
You're sleeping too much, Mr. 1!

169
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,370
I got out of shape by being in prison.

170
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,290
I don't need you here, Straw Hat! Off you go!

171
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,340
Why are you standing in my way, Crocodile?

172
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,160
I'm not in the best mood now.

173
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,890
So you better watch yourself, "Hawk-Eye!"

174
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,100
Luffy!

175
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,360
I want to help you, too!

176
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,860
Shoot Monkey D. Luffy.

177
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,290
Boa Hancock. Friendly
operative. Abort attack.

178
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,790
Hey!

179
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,370
What do you think you're doing?!

180
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,680
You're a Warlord, aren't you, Boa Hancock?!

181
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,440
Why do you keep stopping the Pacifistas?!

182
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,850
I thought you were on the Government side!

183
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,810
You're such a senseless man!
You don't know anything!

184
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,230
What?!

185
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,900
Let me tell you one thing.

186
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,660
Love is always a hurricane!

187
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,050
What're you talking about?!

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,940
Damn Straw Hat!

189
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,560
Buggy!

190
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,270
Captain Buggy! How's everything going?

191
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,780
It doesn't look good, guys.

192
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,030
I appeared sensationally in front
of the whole world a while ago.

193
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:59,960
But now people are paying attention to Straw
Hat who is running to the scaffold like a fool!

194
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,630
Guys, who should be today's leading star?

195
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,810
Captain Buggy!

196
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,040
That's right!

197
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,640
I gotta do something flashier
than Straw Hat one more time!

198
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,060
Hey, let me use the Transponder Snail!

199
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,050
Captain Buggy! I'm afraid that
the Snail is still frozen...

200
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,520
What?! Defrost it right away!

201
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,320
It'll melt if you soak it in the seawater
that is heated by Akainu's lava!

202
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,630
It melted!

203
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,070
--Good. Bring it to me!
--Okay!

204
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,910
Here you go!

205
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,240
Please!

206
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,290
It's shrivelled up!

207
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,960
Oh, we shouldn't soak it in seawater!

208
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,750
What the hell, I think it still works.

209
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,340
We've taken the trouble to steal it from
the Navy,

210
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,010
we have to take good care of it.

211
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,970
Transponder Snail-san, could
you wake up for a minute?

212
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,960
Good morning, sir!

213
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,820
No, he pulled in his head!

214
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,960
It's because of your uncanny faces!

215
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,720
Please excuse us, we were born this way!

216
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,870
Damn! Straw Hat will reach the scaffold any
minute while I'm fooling around like this!

217
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,190
Fire!

218
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,290
Not very much longer - make
a path to the scaffold!

219
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,560
They're desperate!

220
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,260
You bastard!

221
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,190
Whitebeard!

222
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,560
Fish-Man Karate!

223
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,750
Arabesque Brick Fist!

224
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,950
Jimbei, what the hell are you doing?!

225
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,410
Didn't you hear that I said
"back Ace's brother up?"

226
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,710
I don't belong to the Whitebeard Pirates
so I don't have to obey your order!

227
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,920
Stupid!

228
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,740
They made a path!

229
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,450
The scaffold is close now, Straw boy!

230
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,250
You just run straight!

231
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,000
Alright!

232
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,750
Now is our chance to do it.

233
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm sorry that you must do this when you're
not fully recovered.

234
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,720
But we need you!

235
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,020
It's nothing, Ivan-san.

236
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,480
Don't worry about it.

237
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,530
Crab-chan!

238
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,100
Whoa! Wh-What is it?!

239
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,270
Inazuma of the Revolutionaries
army! He did it!

240
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,730
There's a bridge! Alright!

241
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,450
Straw Hat is heading straight
towards the scaffold!

242
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,990
Do something or he'll reach it!

243
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,780
Don't let him!

244
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,660
We can't! These pirates aren't letting us by!

245
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,330
Gah! Use guns! Fire at Straw Hat!

246
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,180
What?! Th-They are...

247
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,280
...commanders of the Whitebeards!

248
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,270
Ace's brother! Just run straight, don't stop!

249
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,330
Break through all at once!

250
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,550
Don't let him pass through!

251
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,390
Gum-Gum...

252
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,890
...Battle Axe!

253
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,240
Luffy-kun, go ahead!

254
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,570
Alright, thanks!

255
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,610
Don't let him go!

256
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,320
Death Wink!

257
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,080
No one will pass by here!

258
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Heehaw!

259
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,130
Just advance, Straw boy!

260
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,690
Straw Hat will make it!

261
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,010
Yeah! Keep going!

262
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,180
Yank Straw Hat down!

263
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,790
Go, Straw Hat!

264
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,850
Set Ace free!

265
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,850
I can't believe that you use that
kid as a trump card, Whitebeard!

266
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,980
But I won't let him go any further!

267
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,280
Whitebeard!

268
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,750
Why don't you stay quiet and watch?

269
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,760
Luffy!

270
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,110
I'm here, Ace!

271
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,330
It's Garp the hero!

272
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,000
Grandpa! Move out of my way!

273
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,830
I'm not going to move!

274
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,250
Because I'm a vice admiral of the Navy!

275
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,720
I've been fighting against pirates
since long before you were born!

276
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,680
Old man!

277
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,940
If you wanna pass through here,
you have to kill me first!

278
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Straw Hat Luffy!

279
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,150
Because of the path you two...

280
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,530
...have chosen to live!!

281
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,280
Luffy runs down the path Inazuma created

282
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,970
intent on reaching Ace, but
Garp stands in his way.

283
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,610
The Navy and pirates...

284
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,780
When a grandfather and grandson who walk
different paths meet again in battle,

285
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,940
what feelings are packed into
the blows they exchange?

286
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

287
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,190
"Each on Different Paths! Luffy vs. Garp!"

288
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,400
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
