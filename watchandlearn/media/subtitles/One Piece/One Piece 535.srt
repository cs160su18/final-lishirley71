00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,690
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

It's not our way to worry

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

It’s important not to wake up

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,540

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
ichi, ni, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,000
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,190
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,370
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,710
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,070
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

74
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,450
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training.

75
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,200
And on their way to the
next stage - the New World,

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,490
they reached the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

77
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,690
But they have yet to gather and are
stirring things up as a fragmented crew!

78
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:41,650
"Hordy's Onslaught! The Retaliatory
Plan Set Into Motion!"

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,870
Look at that, Luffy-sama!

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,130
That cloud looks like an animal called a
"racoon" that I've seen before in a book!

81
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,170
Ah, that looks like Chopper!

82
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,180
Chopper?

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,560
Uh-huh! Chopper is my friend!

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,510
Friend?

85
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,810
Something is flying...

86
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,640
I can't see clearly, it's too far.

87
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Luffy-sama, what's wrong?

88
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,410
THE RYUGU KINGDOM
THE PORT TOWN--CORAL HILL

89
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,720
Mom, what is that?!

90
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,430
Hey, look at that!

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,840
What is it?

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Ryugu Palace! Ryugu Palace! Come in!

93
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,680
THE MAIN ENTRANCE
BORDER CONTROL HEADQUARTERS

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,350
Ryugu Palace! This is Border Control!

95
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,190
Hello? Hello?

96
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,660
--That's weird.
--Clank.

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,530
Why can't we reach them?
Is the Transponder Snail sick?

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,830
Why are they coming in flocks
to the Fish-Man Island?

99
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,710
I have no idea.

100
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,200
I know those dangerous people
from the Fish-Man District

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,580
don't just come here for the shopping.

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,770
Listen, guys!

103
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,770
Today will be remembered as the day

104
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,320
that everyone on the Fish-Man
Island united under one flag!

105
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,950
All Fish-Men, including the Merfolk,
have to be like-minded!

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,750
We must dominate the humans

107
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,120
since they're such lowly creatures
who can't even breathe in the water!

108
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's correct the mistakes of history now!

109
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,990
Today will be the anniversary
of our engagement, Shirahoshi!

110
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,610
No need to hurry. Let's get married tomorrow!

111
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,200
That annoying faction from the Sun Pirates
- Jimbei's group--is not here-dosun!

112
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,710
Neptune, the God of the Sea, and the
brothers; Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, Manboshi!

113
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,290
Much! If we can bring those 4 under control,
Neptune's army can't stand against us-ch!

114
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,660
Let's bite all the soldiers' flesh off!

115
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,740
I'll just cut them--whatever
you tell me to do.

116
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,930
Let's begin.

117
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,100
Go ahead and begin conquering
major towns on your own!

118
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,810
The Ryugu Kingdom falls today!

119
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,230
And then we will dominate the sea floor!

120
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,620
Just in time.

121
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,380
The Sea Forest...
I wonder what this place is like.

122
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,470
There's no mistaking her!
Nico Robin of the Straw Hats!

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,770
Woman! You and your friends are
suspects in 2 ongoing investigations!

124
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,120
First, for multiple counts of
Mermaid kidnapping! Second,

125
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,400
you people are suspected of being

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,490
a potential risk to the Fish-Man Island
based on Madam Sharley's prevision!

127
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,870
So we're taking all of the
Straw Hats into custody!

128
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,670
I don't know what you're talking about.
And did you say "prevision"?

129
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,380
You people need to get your brains checked...

130
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,110
...if you unashamedly believe
in such unscientific things.

131
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,390
Madam Sharley's previsions
are accurate! Come with us!

132
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,480
No thank you. I don't want to miss my bus.

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,980
Get her!

134
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,730
Mil Fleurs!

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,760
W-We have to report... She... got... away...

136
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,170
SEA FOREST

137
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,770
They had information as I thought.
There is a Poneglyph somewhere here.

138
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,270
I think this kingdom holds the
important key to the 100-Year Void!

139
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,000
THE RYUGU PALACE

140
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,460
--What's wrong with these guys?
--One after another...

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,430
Why do we always get involved in trouble?

142
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,890
Stop whining, Nami! The battle is on already!

143
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,230
They keep attacking us so we have no choice.

144
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,570
Shut up, Zoro! We don't wanna get ourselves
into more trouble than we already have!

145
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,530
What's wrong with pirates
fighting pirates? There's no crime.

146
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,490
Boy, he never learns!

147
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,830
Guys, you're barely clinging to life
- why do you wanna fight so badly?

148
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,040
Let's settle this peacefully...

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,250
Do you think they'll give up that easily?

150
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,340
The switch for the gateway...

151
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,140
If we can't open it, they'll kill us!

152
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,930
Kill them!

153
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,140
Kill them!

154
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,520
Kill them!

155
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,520
Let me do it too!

156
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,940
Kill them!

157
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,470
You little...!

158
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,540
They leave me no choice.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,380
Die!

160
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,010
Why don't they get it?

161
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,300
Outta my way!

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,160
Oops!

163
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,160
I wonder what that was.

164
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,810
Luffy-sama.

165
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,690
Why are you so strong?

166
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,890
I've been training myself since I was a kid.

167
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,020
But there were people stronger than me.

168
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,490
Oh, there are people even stronger than you?

169
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,330
What's wrong, Shark? You don't feel well?

170
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,250
Megalo?

171
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,710
Do you have a stomach ache, Shark?

172
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,830
That was close! Be careful, Shark!

173
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Don't accuse me of cutting
them just because I like it!

174
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,730
But you looked like you were enjoying it.
You're a natural born manslayer!

175
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,920
Well then, if you were attacked by pirates,
what would you do? Serve tea?!

176
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,410
Well, serving tea and
talking is one way to solve...

177
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,330
They wouldn't let you!

178
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,250
In any case, if you beat them all,

179
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,710
you won't be able to find
out what they wanted!

180
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Stop worrying so much about them.

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,790
Something is wrong with this picture...

182
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,510
Why do most of our crewmembers
tend to act like this?

183
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,730
--Well, look at our captain.
--Yeah, there's no point in even questioning it.

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,150
I wonder if Luffy-san has met the Mermaid
Princess already. I wanna see her too!

185
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,240
More importantly, untie me!
Give me back Shirahoshi-jamon!

186
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,910
Why do you think that we want to
kidnap the Mermaid Princess?!

187
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,920
I know Straw Hat Luffy did
it-jamon! Shirahoshi!

188
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,840
I saw Luffy-san and Shark-san
coming out of the room for sure,

189
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,630
but I didn't see the Mermaid
Princess with them.

190
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,100
But she is not the kind of girl who
just sneaks out on her own-jamon.

191
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,600
Shirahoshi is as big as myself-jamon.
Someone will notice her if she gets out.

192
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,720
What?! The Mermaid Princess is big?!

193
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm a princess-jamon!

194
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,940
No way...

195
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh yeah-jamon! Maybe, he hid Shirahoshi
in Megalo's mouth and took her out!

196
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,480
Stop making us laugh under
these circumstances, King.

197
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,050
Who would do such a thing?
Even if he had the idea...

198
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,810
My nose is itching too.

199
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,060
Luffy-sama, did you catch cold?

200
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't often catch cold.
I wonder what it is.

201
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,920
Shirahoshi!

202
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,920
In any event, our captain wouldn't kidnap anybody!
You better look for somebody else!

203
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,890
No, I can't think of anybody else!
If Shirahoshi doesn't come back safely,

204
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,530
you can't have your ship
or friends back-jamon!

205
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,270
No! You can't do that to us!

206
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,280
I... I did it!

207
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,410
Looks like those human
pirates pulled it off.

208
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,060
Sunny, are you alright?! You're a super
miracle ship just as I thought!

209
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,060
This place is like a graveyard of ships.

210
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,940
The tide brings sunken ships here.

211
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,890
Isn't it ironic?

212
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,280
Although that's what this place is,
it receives the blessings of the Sun Tree Eve -

213
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,280
corals have grown beautifully
drawing fish and whales here.

214
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,890
That's amazing! There are a lot of whales
and they are so much bigger than the Sunny.

215
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,460
Whales only come to fertile seas.

216
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,470
This place is wonderful!

217
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,330
I've been studying this magical
Sea Forest in the deep sea.

218
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,050
Yeah, it's hard to believe that
this place is in the deep sea.

219
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,430
Just like the Fish-Man Island.

220
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,480
Treasure Tree Adam--it is so valuable.
But you built a hell of a ship out of it.

221
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,660
You think so?

222
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,780
It's made with the same material as the
King of the Pirates' ship that Tom-san made.

223
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,540
It's my greatest design of all!

224
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,680
I'll do the coating. Count on me, completely!

225
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,410
Oh, thank you... Um... Can I ask your name?

226
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm Den.

227
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,260
Den-san. You don't look like him.

228
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,870
You're a Merman--not a cowfish.

229
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,190
I thought you'd look like him

230
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,980
since you're his brother.

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,610
DEN (TOM'S YOUNGER BROTHER)
SHIPWRIGHT/RESEARCHER OF THE SEA FOREST

232
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,610
That's how a human would think.

233
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,240
Races on earth--family members often
look like one another, don't they?

234
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,980
Fish-Men are a little different.

235
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:11,100
Fish-Men and Merfolk each have different,
ancient genes from their ancestors.

236
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,880
A MOTHER AND SON

237
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,160
When an octopus Mermaid
gives birth to a shark Merman,

238
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,640
that means one of her
ancestors was a shark Merfolk.

239
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,060
It's not so strange when kids don't look
like their parents on the Fish-Man Island.

240
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:34,360
That's why we can't understand why you
humans want to discriminate against...

241
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,490
...those who don't look like yourselves.

242
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,520
Hmm...

243
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,730
By the way, one of your
ancestors was a robot?

244
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm a human.

245
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,460
Human? Oh, one of your ancestors
was a humanoid robot.

246
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,510
No, a normal human!

247
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,340
It's okay.

248
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,880
It's not okay!

249
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,760
Oh yeah, she mentioned you and
Iceberg-kun in her letter.

250
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,310
Oh, that old bag Kokoro wrote to you?

251
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,900
What a thoughtful old woman.

252
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,970
So I know everything about what happened.

253
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,310
My brother lived his life completely
like he always did, to the very end!

254
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,490
And you traveled all the way to tell me that.

255
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,750
He had a good pupil.

256
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,670
Stop it!

257
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,460
Oh, so you're a robot!

258
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,670
No... Well, let's just
say that I'm a pervert.

259
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:42,260
Oh, by the way, somebody has been
sitting there for quite a while.

260
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,180
Oh, that's Boss Jimbei!

261
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,140
Boss?

262
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,470
He said he's expecting somebody.

263
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,030
He doesn't wanna enter the
island since he's a wanted man.

264
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,360
THE ENTRANCE OF THE RYUGU PALACE

265
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,530
THE GATEWAY

266
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,210
THE MAIN GATE

267
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,000
THE PALACE GATE

268
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,960
We have intruders!

269
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,420
How did you guys get this far?!

270
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,640
I can't believe this! I was ready
to start a fight right away

271
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,310
but Neptune and all the soldiers are tied up!

272
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,940
I didn't expect to see a present like this.

273
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,490
What a surprise.

274
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,870
That guy!

275
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,410
Why is he here?!

276
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,830
The hateful Vander Decken!
You've shown up at last!

277
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,420
And that's...

278
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,420
...Hordy Jones from the Fish-Man District!

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,510
Why did he come back here?

280
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,220
Hordy? That guy is...

281
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,640
He was once a decorated soldier in our army.

282
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,450
Is this some kind of trap?
It's too good to be true.

283
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,880
We've had visitors one after another.

284
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,700
What a lively palace.

285
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,810
Ah-ha! You guys are their accomplices!
You let them in, didn't you?!

286
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:43,100
You know what, we wouldn't be
here if you guys didn't invite us!

287
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,840
They look formidable! Who are those people?!

288
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,890
--Hey, let us have our arms at least!
--Please, let us fight!

289
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,900
Vander Decken!
Since you've shown up, there is no doubt!

290
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,570
You're the one who did it!
Give me back my daughter!

291
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,580
We haven't even got married yet.
It's too soon for you to say that, Father-sama.

292
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,740
Don't call me Father-sama!

293
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,790
Where did you take Shirahoshi?!
You'd better tell me she's unharmed!

294
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,420
What are you talking about?
You're talking like the Princess is missing.

295
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,210
Quit acting dumb!

296
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,800
Why else would Shirahoshi have
disappeared from her room all of the sudden?!

297
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,350
My Shirahoshi disappeared?!

298
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,850
She's my... My daughter-jamon!

299
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,610
Neptune-sama, don't lose
your temper over his nonsense!

300
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,530
Calm down, Decken.

301
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:55,070
Look. All of the humans that you threw,
aimed at the Mermaid Princess, are here.

302
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,190
That means that Princess Shirahoshi
was here at least during that time.

303
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,420
Help me...

304
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,930
Plus, it doesn't matter
if they're lying or not

305
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:11,230
because you know how to
check where she is now.

306
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,890
Check where she is?

307
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:23,440
You're right! Hordy,
you're a very smart guy! I suspect!

308
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,350
Huh? Is he leaving?

309
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,530
What is he gonna do?

310
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,660
Alright, you coral, fly to Shirahoshi!

311
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,200
It's not heading towards the tower!

312
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,850
We've been in love for a decade!
Nothing will tear us apart...

313
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,560
...except for death!

314
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,550
...And I had a very big fart!

315
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,150
Luffy-sama, that is so
inappropriate to talk about.

316
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,630
Is it?

317
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,820
Before you become somebody else's,

318
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,450
I'd rather see you dead with
your blood splattered all over!

319
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,570
Shirahoshi!

320
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,460
A wall of the royal palace is destroyed
and seawater begins to rush in.

321
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,010
Hordy attacks Neptune's
army with his full might.

322
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,530
The soldiers risk their lives to
protect Neptune, the God of the Sea

323
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,390
when Zoro stands to face Hordy.

324
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,790
With the seawater is rising, Zoro will
battle in dramatically unfavorable conditions.

325
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,120
On the next episode of One Piece!

326
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,070
"The Battle in the Ryugu Palace!
Zoro vs. Hordy!"

327
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
