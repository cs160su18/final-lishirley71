00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,530

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,650
mezasu mirai wa onaji--

56

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540

One, two, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,280
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,650
a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,850
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,190
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,900
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago.

80
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,570
And in order to go on to the
next stage--the New World,

81
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,040
they set sail for the Fish-Man Island
located 10,000 meters below sea level.

82
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,460
Hey guys, come here!

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,420
The Fish-Man Island!

84
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,760
It's huge!

85
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,300
It's in a big bubble! There are
clouds? Maybe there is air inside.

86
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,930
That's the Fish-Man Island
so we're 10,000 meters deep now!

87
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,610
Yeah! We made it!

88
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,410
Hey, what are they?!

89
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,450
Who are they?

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,330
The group of sea monsters!

91
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,000
We're dead! After we got all the way here!

92
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,930
They're so cool! The sea monsters!

93
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,600
Somebody's riding it!

94
00:04:51,140 --> 00:05:00,150
"Landing at the Fish-Man Island!
Beautiful Mermaids!"

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Why are you obeying such fools as humans,

96
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,450
Kraken!

97
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,970
What are you doing, Surume?!
We were almost there!

98
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,520
Saying that won't help!
Hang on! Don't get thrown off!

99
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,850
My eyes are spinning!

100
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,230
So are mine! But I don't have eyes!

101
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,480
We're right in middle of the sea monsters!

102
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,690
You guys are the Straw Hats, aren't you?

103
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,030
Wh-Who are you? How do you know about us?

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,610
Yes, I know you all very well.

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,080
You are the ones who foiled the
plans of the Arlong Pirates.

106
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,210
That act was easy enough to understand.

107
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,580
But then you stood up for Hachi-san,

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,830
the former officer of the Arlong Pirates 2 years ago

109
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,930
and knocked one of the hateful
Celestial Dragons out!

110
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,640
Just like Fisher Tiger, the hero of
the Fish-Man Island who we respect.

111
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,150
Fisher... Tiger...

112
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,110
THE NEW FISH-MAN PIRATES - FIGHTER HAMMOND

113
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,110
It's hard to decide what I should do with you.

114
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,860
So, tell me. Are you guys our enemies or not?

115
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,860
THE NEW FISH-MAN PIRATES – ASSASSIN HYOUZOU

116
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,160
THE NEW FISH-MAN PIRATES - FIGHTER KASAGON

117
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,910
I give you an option.

118
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,450
Do you wanna enlist under our banner -

119
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,250
the New Fish-Man Pirates?

120
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,830
Or do you refuse?

121
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,880
If you refuse, we'll sink you.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,000
What did you say?

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,590
Franky, fuel up!

124
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,630
What are you gonna do?

125
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,640
You know that Luffy and the
others won't give in to them.

126
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,720
But we're 10,000 meters deep now.

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,310
We can't even fight and
there's no chance to win.

128
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,850
So we run!

129
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,860
Do the Coup de Burst using all the air we

130
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,360
have and charge into the Fish-Man Island!

131
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,150
Are you serious?

132
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,740
Otherwise, we are all gonna
die after coming this far.

133
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,080
It seems like that's the
only way that we can survive.

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,710
Okay, I'll fill it up. Franky, steer the ship!

135
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,000
Alright, super count on me!

136
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,520
Looks like they're getting busy.
Aren't they up to something?

137
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,650
Humans are not so clever anyway.
It's no use doing anything.

138
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,690
So, do you wanna work under us, Straw Hat Luffy?

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,530
No way! Stupid!

140
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,500
You refused... the offer to join
the New Fish-Man Pirates!

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,050
Then you guys are the Fish-Men's
enemy! Just sinful human beings!

142
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,640
Bleah!

143
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,760
Why should we work under you?!

144
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,060
Luffy, don't rub them the wrong way!

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,480
It's a shame. Then we can't
let you pass through here.

146
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,150
This is where we sink you!

147
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,530
Sea Lion!

148
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,080
It's done! Franky, do it!

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
Roger!

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,580
Sink it!

151
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,920
Wanna fight?!

152
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,800
Go, Franky!

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,090
The Sunny is a lion too!

154
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,260
Let's fight someday, Sea Lion!

155
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,060
Here we go! Coup de Burst!

156
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,230
The ship is...!

157
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,990
We're losing air...

158
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,330
We're gonna get crushed...

159
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,460
I can't breathe! But I don't have lungs.

160
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,420
Endure it! Until we reach the Fish-Man Island!

161
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,310
What's wrong with that ship?!

162
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,310
We're heading in!

163
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,730
Wait for me, my dear Mermaids!

164
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,200
The coating came off!
It got stuck on the giant bubble!

165
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,290
Oh, look ahead!

166
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,660
What is that?!

167
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,960
The bubble here is a double structure!

168
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,380
Normal ships will fall in this
layer because there is only air!

169
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,130
We're gonna run into one
more bubble! Hold on tight!

170
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,520
Water?!

171
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,620
The current is strong!

172
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,250
Help... me...

173
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,750
Can't breathe...

174
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,500
We have 4 Devil Fruit eaters but...

175
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,930
Reach...

176
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,140
...out!

177
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,230
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

178
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,150
Damn! I can't swim against the current!

179
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,380
That's a crazy way to get in there.
Maybe they tried to self-destruct.

180
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,480
Do you wanna go after them, Hammond?

181
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,290
I don't know if they're still alive though.

182
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,910
Yeah, we'll go in.

183
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,730
I don't want Neptune's army to find them first.

184
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,480
But first, let's go back to
Noah and let Boss know that...

185
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,070
...Straw Hat who shattered
Arlong-san's ambition is here.

186
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:52,250
THE FISH-MAN ISLAND - THE SEA FLOOR

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
Hey.

188
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,420
Hey, look.

189
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,340
--I'll look.
--I won't!

190
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,850
--Maybe I'll look.
--I looked, so what?

191
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,890
Hey, he's moving!

192
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,520
--He moved!
--He didn't!

193
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,650
--Maybe he moved.
--He moved, so what?

194
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,660
Yeah, he woke up!

195
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,240
Luffy!

196
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,540
Where am I?

197
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,460
Oh, Luffy-chin!

198
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm glad that you're okay!

199
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,550
How are you?

200
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,200
Camie! It's been a while!

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,830
You've gotten prettier, Camie-chan!

202
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,420
Yeah, long time no see!
I'm glad to see you again!

203
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,380
Camie is here - that means...

204
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,170
We landed on the Fishman Island?!

205
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,540
Yeah, we did!

206
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,210
I've been told that we were

207
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,500
drowning but some Mermaids rescued us!

208
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,100
That's right.

209
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,980
As a matter of fact, we just woke up a couple minutes ago too.

210
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,520
This is Camie-chan's house.

211
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,230
Here's your hat.

212
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,730
Oh, this is Camie's house.

213
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,250
I'm sorry!

214
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,340
I was gonna pick you guys up

215
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,920
but I thought it was a month later.

216
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,270
Don't worry!

217
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,410
Where are the others?

218
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,250
Well... it looks like we got separated.

219
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,420
I wonder if they're okay.

220
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,670
Is that so?

221
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,760
Yeah, I was following them up to some point

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,260
but they were taken somewhere else.

223
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,010
Well, I'm sure they'll be fine!

224
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,800
I think so. The bone can't do much in the sea

225
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,430
but they got the robot and the
green one so they'll be fine!

226
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,190
Yeah, they'll be fine

227
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,770
I wanna see the others too.

228
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,320
Oh, here! I know you're all freezing.

229
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,450
I made soup so have some and get warm.

230
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,660
Ta-dah! Cold seaweed soup!

231
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,780
You'll love it!

232
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,790
Cold soup?

233
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,960
Uh-huh!

234
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,630
You can't get warm with
cold soup! What should I do?!

235
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,050
What?!

236
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,390
I made a mistake!

237
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,100
Don't worry, Camie-chan!

238
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,190
It warms me up anyway!

239
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,900
How is that possible?

240
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,690
Hey, Sanji! I want some too!

241
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,240
Your clothes are dry!

242
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,530
--They are dry.
--They aren't dry!

243
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,450
--Maybe they are dry.
--They are dry, so what?

244
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,210
You dried our clothes! Thanks!

245
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,870
Thank you!

246
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,670
By the way, who are you guys?

247
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,760
Oh, they're my friends.
The Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets.

248
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,680
--I'm Ichika!
--I'm Nika!

249
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,590
--I'm Sanka!
--I'm Yonka!

250
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm Yonka Two!

251
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,890
Why can't it be Goka?

252
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,020
They swim fast and they're pretty savvy.

253
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,230
Oh, really?

254
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,020
We're at the sea floor of the Mermaid Cove.

255
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,580
And this is the girls' dorm for the Mermaid Cafe

256
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,400
so I have a lot of friends here!

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,490
What?

258
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,160
G... G... G...

259
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,530
Girls' dorm?!

260
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,200
Oh no!

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,350
Camie-chan!

262
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,170
What... what... What is Mermaid Cafe?

263
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,310
It's a cafe where I'm working as a waitress.

264
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,340
There are a lot of beautiful Mermaids!

265
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,470
B-Beautiful Mermaids?!

266
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,300
Do you want a cup of coffee? Or...

267
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,180
--Sanji is...
--...In danger!

268
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,980
--Dammit!
--He endured!

269
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,690
I...

270
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:36,070
I swore that I'd never have
a nosebleed and pass out...

271
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,620
...on the Fish-Man Island!

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,870
So I should be rewarded by now, shouldn't I...?

273
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,580
How desperate...

274
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,710
Oh yeah, let's go up!
I want you to meet my friends.

275
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,640
Oh, it's a turtle!

276
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,470
It says "Sea Turtle Elevator."

277
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,140
Turtle-chin, take us up.

278
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,270
This is a coral apartment in the sea.

279
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,400
The dorm is at the very
bottom so the rent is cheap.

280
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,570
The top floor gets natural light
so it's the most expensive.

281
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,580
Are you poor? By the way,
where are Hachi and Pappagu?

282
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,540
Ha-chin got severely
injured about a year ago.

283
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,420
He tried to protect the Sunny at Sabaody.

284
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,920
I heard that he's pretty much recovered now

285
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,790
but Ha-chin is originally from the Fish-Man District so

286
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,010
he's resting there.

287
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,220
Fish-Man District?

288
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,430
Yeah, it's kind of a rough area

289
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,520
but I can take you there since
I feel safe with you guys.

290
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,980
Let's go later! I have to
thank him face to face.

291
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,530
Okay, I got it! And Pappagu is...

292
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,530
He's a very famous designer

293
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,740
so he has a big mansion in Fishverly
Hills, the high-class district.

294
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm gonna deliver clams
there today so come with me!

295
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,330
He's your pet, right?
Why don't you live with him?

296
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,760
That area is way beyond my means.

297
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,970
We have better clams here, anyway.

298
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,050
We're almost there!

299
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,970
What's that straw-like thing?

300
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,220
Oh, that's...

301
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,270
...the Water Road that a bubble craftsman made.

302
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,230
We and the fish get in and...

303
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,940
Here, watch.

304
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,780
Oh, that's fast!

305
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,160
It's great!

306
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,370
Camie-chan, where are you going?!

307
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,960
We're here, on the surface!

308
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,590
Luffy-chin!

309
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,720
See? I can even swim in the sky!

310
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,590
Oh, looks fun!

311
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,220
Wait a minute!

312
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,600
Besides that, there's a sky
and clouds in the deep sea!

313
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,230
You're right! I wonder how it's possible!

314
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,350
Hey, Camie!

315
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,360
Huh? It's a girl's voice!

316
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,480
Where is she?

317
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,490
Everybody!

318
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,200
That's...

319
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,490
Are your friends fine now?
The pirates who were drowning.

320
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,580
You guys didn't come in by the entrance.

321
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,380
Hello! You guys don't look that scary.

322
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,630
You guys entered illegally?
So wild! I love pirates!

323
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,400
It's like a living fairy tale!

324
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,440
A land of coral! The Mermaid Cove!

325
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,330
Sanji is crying!

326
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,420
He's crying harder than
when he left the Baratie.

327
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,800
I found it!

328
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,680
This is my All Blue!

329
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,270
Is it really what you want, Sanji?

330
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,440
Let me introduce them to you!

331
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,360
He's the captain - Luffy-chin.

332
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,650
Yeah, good to see you!

333
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,110
The crying one is Sanji-chin.

334
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,610
The one with the nose - Usopp-chin.

335
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,360
Nice to meet you!

336
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,030
The racoon is Chopper-chin.

337
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm a reindeer!

338
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,040
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

339
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,750
Come with me! Let's dance in the water!

340
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,930
Oh yeah, I get it now. This is too good to be true.

341
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,020
I'm probably gonna die today!

342
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,700
How negative!

343
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,730
Seriously, what happened to you in the past 2 years?

344
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,690
This is the paradise that
you've been dreaming of!

345
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,610
You're so funny, Sanji!

346
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,700
No, he's not trying to be funny!

347
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,960
THE FISH-MAN DISTRICT "NOAH"

348
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,310
I see.

349
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,360
Straw Hat Luffy finally got this far.

350
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,440
Yes.

351
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,450
What should we do, Boss?

352
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,580
Bring him...

353
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,080
...here!

354
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,590
At Mermaid Cove Sanji reverts to his
old self and fools around with the mermaids.

355
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,220
But then the three Princes
of Fish-Man Island arrive.

356
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,740
Not knowing what to expect, they hide,

357
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,850
though then an unimaginable accident occurs.

358
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,270
On the next episode of One Piece!

359
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,070
"Excitement Blow-out!
Sanji's Life Under Threat!"

360
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
