00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,980
My guess was that there'd be five survivors.

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,990
Now, who will die?

19
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,790
You die!

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,380
How insolent!

21
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,400
"Showdown in the Ancient Ruins!
Sky God Eneru's Goal!!"

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
There!

23
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,290
Ah!

24
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Hey, this house...

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,210
You remember that pretty lady who
often played the harp at the beach, right?

26
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,940
Yes, I know her very well.

27
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,220
Pagaya-san and his daughter,
Conis-san, live here.

28
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,280
Both of them are very nice people.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
They treated me to lunch once.

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Well, that woman was actually a
bad person. And her father, too!

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,220
What?!

32
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,070
I heard it, too.

33
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,920
If I'm not mistaken, they helped
bad people from the Blue Sea.

34
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,440
Can't be...!

35
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,340
That's true! They're really bad
people who went against God.

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,550
My father said so, too!

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Y-Your father did? I see...

38
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,850
Oh, come to think of it, your father is...

39
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,430
Yes, my father is a member of the
Divine Squad, so he's been serving God.

40
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,740
My mother always tells me
that he'll come home soon,

41
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,170
but I've never even seen his face.

42
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,180
Oh, but he works for God.
You have a wonderful father.

43
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,330
Really?!

44
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,240
Of course you do! I hope you'll
be able to see your father soon.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,300
Yeah!

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Skypiea will be dropped into the Blue Sea!

47
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,680
This nation will disappear!!

48
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,130
I can't let that man's feelings be wasted!

49
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,190
I must... I must tell them at any cost!

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,200
You're telling me to die?

51
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,380
Listen to yourselves.

52
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,710
Dangerous... That guy's dangerous!

53
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,190
That's just what you'd expect
from the game's survivors.

54
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,860
However, it seems you don't
realize who you're talking to.

55
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,680
It seems that you still don't
understand the existence of God.

56
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,510
An old fool who wishes
happiness for Skypiea...

57
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,880
A warrior who single-mindedly
desires his "homeland"...

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,770
And thieves from the Blue Sea,
who are after the gold...

59
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,850
There are many hardships in this world,
so I don't care what my lambs wish for...

60
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,830
...but this nation has a fundamental problem.

61
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,340
If you have time to spout such nonsense,
tell me where the Divine Squad is!

62
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,040
Just what is your goal?!

63
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,760
The return of His Majesty, Gan Fall.

64
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,370
The return of His Majesty?

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
That's right. After his visit,
God returns to his rightful place.

66
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,410
Return?! Are you saying
that you're leaving Skypiea?

67
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,140
That's right. I've got a place to return to.

68
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,270
It is a place regarded as God's home

69
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,520
by the people on the
sky island where I was born.

70
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,100
What's he...?

71
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,940
People call that place "Endless Vearth."

72
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,060
There, the ground extends
as far as the eye can see!

73
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,050
That is precisely the dream world that I seek!

74
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,290
This Endless Vearth is a land befitting me!!

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:52,610
Fighting over Upper Yard...
such small Vearth... is a petty triviality.

76
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,350
Listen. The root of your
conflicts lies in a deeper place.

77
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,170
Think about it carefully!

78
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,770
It was born in the sky, though it's not a cloud.

79
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,190
It lives in the sky, though it's not a bird.

80
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,800
A nation rooted in the sky... This nation
itself is an utterly unnatural existence!

81
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,240
Soil has a place to return to.
So do people and God.

82
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,250
D-Don't tell me you...

83
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,990
It's nothing you should be surprised about.

84
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:41,010
As God, I'm only adhering to...
yes, the province of nature.

85
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,830
That's right. I will drag down
every human from this sky!

86
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,360
Are you planning to wipe out this nation?

87
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,150
That's just natural.

88
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,120
Don't be conceited, Eneru!

89
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,540
The term "God" is just a title used
to refer to the leader of this nation!

90
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,540
Yes, up until now, anyway.

91
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,930
The real "God" does not
live in the human world!

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,230
Former God, Gan Fall...

93
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,810
You were worried about the
Divine Squad, weren't you?

94
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,460
Six years ago, you lost against my forces,

95
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,620
and I took your 650
subordinates under my charge.

96
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,160
Just this morning, they finished the
work I asked them to do on this island.

97
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,900
I told you, didn't I?

98
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,870
The only ones who are standing on this
island right now are the six of us here.

99
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,790
Such a shame...

100
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,840
Y-You...

101
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,760
It's not that I wanted to harm them.

102
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,260
When I told them my goal...

103
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,410
...they challenged me with
angry looks on their faces!

104
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,150
They all have family on Angel Island!

105
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,410
Yes, I know. I have to bury
their families soon, too.

106
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,370
Are you...

107
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,830
...a devil?!

108
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,150
Five million... ten million... twenty million...!

109
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,010
Weren't we...

110
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,490
Weren't we the evil ones?

111
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,810
The Shandian warriors...
They attack God's Island, Upper Yard,

112
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,780
only because they want to get back
the homeland of their ancestors.

113
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,960
Are you thinking about that again, my Lord?

114
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,330
Please look at the blessed
lives of people in Skypiea.

115
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,100
It all started when our ancestors
took away Upper Yard 400 years ago.

116
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,970
Isn't it our duty to carry on this battle
and protect that blessing for this nation?

117
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm sure we've tried to
negotiate as much as possible.

118
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,460
Those who cannot understand it do not
deserve your compassion any longer.

119
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,120
400 years...

120
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:58,890
The time for us, or for them,
to accept defeat may have long passed.

121
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,750
Enemy Attack! Enemy Attack!

122
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,000
Is this an attack by the Shandians?!

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,030
I-It's not the Shandians!

124
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,150
What do you mean?!

125
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,620
A man who calls himself God Eneru...

126
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,830
God Eneru?

127
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,920
Who could he be to call himself
God in front of His Lordship?

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,190
Th-This is...

129
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,240
Divine Squad, huh?
They weren't as strong as I expected.

130
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,170
So you are...

131
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,130
Well, you should at least acknowledge
that they were loyal to God.

132
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,860
Eneru!

133
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,380
So you're God? No, former God, I guess.

134
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,710
How dare you...?!

135
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,330
Eneru-sama, what are we going
to do with this old former God?

136
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,230
Just throw him in the sea or something.

137
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,320
He probably couldn't even
be used for manual labor.

138
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,070
At any rate, this is quite a nice shrine.

139
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,960
But what we need is the Divine Squad.

140
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,840
I'll have them work very
hard as my subordinates.

141
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,440
They are my subordinates.

142
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,700
Quiet! You are not "God" any longer!

143
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,300
20 million volt...

144
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,940
...Vaari!

145
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
Weird knight!!

146
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,460
Old man!

147
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,590
God exists in this world.

148
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,780
How mortifying...!

149
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,720
That God... is me!

150
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,470
A Devil Fruit's Power?!

151
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,560
It's probably the Rumble-Rumble Fruit.

152
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,650
If I'm not mistaken,
among the many kinds of powers,

153
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,170
it's one of those said to be "invincible."

154
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,250
The power of lightning!

155
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,540
Lightning... There's no way
that humans can defeat him!

156
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,030
Well, it's exactly the time that I prophesied.

157
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,620
Now...

158
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,260
...there are five! I'm glad you've survived!

159
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,870
Now, I shall bring you along with me!

160
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,020
To the dream world that I'm setting off to!

161
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,770
To the Endless Vearth!
I shall bring you along with me!!

162
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,850
What?!

163
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,230
There, I will build an
indisputable "Nation of God"!

164
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,850
The only ones who can live there
are the chosen ones here.

165
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,220
What's that guy talking about?

166
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,860
Those subordinates of mine,
who couldn't even handle

167
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,180
a short survival game,
will only lower the nation's stature.

168
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,050
And... What if we refuse?

169
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,860
Robin!

170
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,920
Refuse?

171
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,890
Why? It was decided by God.

172
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,510
If you stay here, you'll fall into
a bottomless pit with this nation!

173
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,800
It's probably true that with
your power, you can do that.

174
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,920
But if you thoughtlessly destroy this nation,

175
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,160
isn't the thing you want going to fall as well?

176
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,500
You mean the golden bell?!

177
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,570
That's right.

178
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,610
Golden bell?

179
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,430
The golden bell...

180
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,870
You needn't worry. I already have some idea.

181
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,710
If I recall the actions you took,
there is only one possible place.

182
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:14,350
I'm pretty sure that I'm thinking
of the same place that you are.

183
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,390
You seem surprised.

184
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,620
Did you think you'd be able
to outwit me by saying that?

185
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,210
How foolish...

186
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,740
Robin!!

187
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,830
I hate calculating women.

188
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,490
No...

189
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,580
She's a woman!

190
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,740
I can see that.

191
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,850
You've got good skills.

192
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,060
Are you... a nutjob?!

193
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,450
Burn Bazooka!!

194
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,770
Kari!

195
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,140
C-Can't be! He erased the
bazooka's powerful fire!

196
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,920
You still don't get it, do you?

197
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,610
The energy that you can
handle is nothing to me.

198
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,160
The thunder reverberated...

199
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,500
That means the air expanded
at the speed of sound!

200
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,050
It's that powerful!! The scale of
his energy is so different from ours!

201
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,200
H-He's really... lightning itself!

202
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,610
Oh, boy... We are about to set off
to the Endless Vearth together.

203
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,350
You don't have to get so
blood-thirsty, you know.

204
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,180
Who said we're coming with you?

205
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,010
I don't care about your
so-called "dream world"!!

206
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,200
Zoro! Don't, Zoro! He's too strong!!

207
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,460
Until I teach your body a lesson,
you probably won't understand...

208
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,820
...the definition of "God."

209
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,930
God has an overwhelming power
that could never be matched,

210
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,000
no matter how hard you struggle!

211
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
And then you feel it...

212
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,890
The despair!

213
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,310
Having all your hopes dashed
is the same as death itself.

214
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,130
Zoro!

215
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,850
People fear death above all things!

216
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,500
That's why people prostrate themselves
before God and beg for mercy.

217
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,450
That just can't be helped.

218
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,990
Living beings are meant to
bow before that which they fear.

219
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,440
What a pity... That's how instinct is.

220
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,900
What's with this guy? He's incredibly strong...!

221
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,250
What's the meaning of this?

222
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,150
Did you come to be killed?

223
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,240
What the...?!

224
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,720
Are you familiar with a thing called
the "Sea Prism Stone," Eneru?!

225
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,900
Sea Prism Stone?

226
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,860
If I'm not mistaken, it's a stone that
can take away Devil Fruit powers!

227
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,080
I see... I feel weakened.

228
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,740
Sea Prism Stone... It's said that it
gives off the same energy as the sea.

229
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,070
It's a sea in solid form, so to speak.

230
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,550
That's why it can weaken
the power of Devil Fruits!

231
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,710
Die!

232
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,870
Y-You shouldn't... I know. It's Reject, right?

233
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,280
Your body will pay a heavy price as well!

234
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,330
What are you dissatisfied about?
You want Vearth, too, don't you?

235
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,210
Shut up! I'm happy to die...

236
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,860
...if I can take you with me!

237
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,790
D-Don't!

238
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,990
Reject!

239
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,690
Did you hear something?

240
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,290
No way...

241
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,410
Did he defeat him?

242
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,810
Racing full speed ahead as always

243
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,560
A to Z, we run through it

244
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,360
We all have worries and fall many times

245
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
But we just need to rise to the top someday

246
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,750
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

247
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,810
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

248
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,310
I never treat you "bad"

249
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,010
How many times did we fall?

250
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:55,100
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

251
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Smile! Come back to you, friends

252
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

253
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,370
Come back to you, friends

254
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,210
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

255
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,910
Come back to you, friends

256
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,410
It's not that people fear God. Fear itself is God.

257
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,000
In that case, I'm fear itself. Hence, I am God.

258
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,770
I will put an end to this nation
in the sky with God's power!

259
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,760
Huh? I don't have a clue
what you're talking about!

260
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,630
On the next episode of One Piece!

261
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,980
"Ambition Toward the Endless Vearth--
The Ark Maxim!!"

262
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
