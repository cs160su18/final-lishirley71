2
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,460
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,760
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,720
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,270
After surviving a fierce battle,

10
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,440
the Straw Hats finally entered the New
World, the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

11
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,200
After landing on Punk Hazard; an island with
two parts, one burning, the other frozen,

12
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,990
they learned about the hideous experiments
performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

13
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,460
and headed off to investigate
but as things got going,

14
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,120
they came to form an alliance with the
Heart Pirates led by Trafalgar Law.

15
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,290
Do as we discussed.

16
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,300
Yeah. While you're taking Caesar
and that woman somewhere else,

17
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,450
I'm gonna find out about the drug.

18
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,110
And Luffy is now headed to
see the Master Caesar Clown.

19
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,560
You will all experience it!

20
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,940
The chemical weapon explosion that
happened four years ago on Punk Hazard!

21
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,740
A world of death in which no one can survive!

22
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,570
And you will learn!

23
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,410
Just how powerful my weapon is,
that it can destroy an island!

24
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,370
And the greatness of the world's best
scientist who created the weapon!

25
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,170
It's me--Master Caesar Clown!

26
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,250
I got you!

27
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,270
"An Intense Battle!
Caesar Exercises His True Power!"

28
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,820
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND--THE
MIDDLE LAKE ZORO'S GROUP

29
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,660
Is that a Slime?

30
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,870
A Slime?

31
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,100
Yes. I was once reading a
book that had a monster...

32
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,230
...that looks exactly like
this one called a "Slime."

33
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,620
I couldn't stop reading it.

34
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,550
The Slime liked to attack women

35
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,030
and its body fluids would only
melt what the women were wearing!

36
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,730
SLIMY, SLIMY

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,270
It was such a dirty monster!

38
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,230
NO!!

39
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,970
What?! That's too convenient!

40
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,470
C-Can I borrow that book sometime?!

41
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,400
Me, too!

42
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,850
Fools! Look carefully.

43
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,280
Pinky promise! Huh?

44
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,940
I don't know if it melts your clothes
but you might not wanna touch it.

45
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,000
The fish are dying from the fluid
that it dropped into the lake.

46
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,090
It's like it's made of toxins.

47
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,300
If nothing is done, the poison
will spread all over the lake.

48
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
Poison?

49
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Then, samurai-san's torso will...

50
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,360
D-Don't tell me you're going in, Sanji-san?!

51
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,190
Do I have a choice? It's my personal mission!

52
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,350
I'm Sanji, I'm a man! I've got to do it!

53
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,700
Sanji-san!

54
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,700
Do something about the Slimes behind you.

55
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,620
What? Behind me?

56
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,880
Copies of the Slime?!
When did they get here?!

57
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,720
Sorry, Nami-san.

58
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm better at swimming than anyone else.

59
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,440
I'll try to get out of the water before
it causes damage to your beautiful body!

60
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,350
Please be careful!

61
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,650
He's risking his life for me

62
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,980
and going into the poisonous lake!

63
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,560
Th-The water is ice-cold!

64
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,030
Where is his torso?

65
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,450
The Slimes are coming toward us!

66
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,580
What should we do about them?

67
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,120
Yeah, what should we do?

68
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,260
Just Monet in the room.

69
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,140
This is the chance.

70
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,140
The Master is not here.

71
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,510
Yeah? Where did he go?

72
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,520
I don't know.

73
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,860
Being such a hideous person, he's
probably watching the fight outside.

74
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,860
I've seen pretty much everything
what I wanted to see on the island.

75
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,360
I'm thinking about leaving here soon.

76
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,370
Oh, we'll miss you.

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,380
There is something I could
use your help with though.

78
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,710
Could you come with me?

79
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,880
Are you asking me out? How sweet!

80
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,220
You're such an unfriendly person. What is it?

81
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,760
You'll see.

82
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,140
Alright. I was bored anyway.

83
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,040
Is that the bird woman that
Usopp was talking about?

84
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,160
What?!

85
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,830
CAESAR'S LABORATORY--THE FRONT DOOR
LUFFY'S GROUP

86
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,660
S-Straw Hat caught the Master!

87
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,750
Way to go, Luffy!

88
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,750
Dammit! That bastard!

89
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,080
Straw Hat!

90
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,870
Let go of me, you fool!

91
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,910
No!

92
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,670
That's what Haki can do? I can't
believe Luffy can do that.

93
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,300
He's grabbing a Logia eater!

94
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,640
Straw Hat! Stay away from the Master!

95
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,510
Let's save the Master!

96
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,270
I won't let you guys do that!

97
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Clutch!

98
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,730
Outta my way!

99
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,860
Since Luffy became so strong, I
bet he can easily beat that guy!

100
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,900
We don't know that yet.

101
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,700
What?

102
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,680
With Armament Haki,

103
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,290
it's possible to strike Logia eaters
who you can't even touch normally.

104
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,580
However, unlike the sea or Sea Prism Stone,

105
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,150
it doesn't drain their powers.

106
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,720
We don't really know the extent
of the Gas-Gas Fruit's power.

107
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,330
Don't get carried away!

108
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,450
Armament Hardening!

109
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,410
Gum-Gum...

110
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,210
...Bell!

111
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,420
Gas Robe!

112
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,590
The smoke!

113
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,760
Damn! Gas Robe!

114
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,220
What is this?

115
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,930
I can't shake it off!

116
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,480
Luffy, hold your breath!
The guy who got it is...

117
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,690
Shit! It's poison gas!

118
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,270
Fool! It's no use doing that!

119
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,490
Once you get wrapped up in the Gas Robe,

120
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,540
you can't get away from
it no matter what you do!

121
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,710
How much longer can you hold your breath?!

122
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,900
Just breathe deeply

123
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,370
and drop dead!

124
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,050
--Luffy!
--Dammit!

125
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,720
After countless experiments,

126
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,680
I finally discovered the deadliest gas!

127
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,530
Now, suffer and die!

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
I have front row seats!

129
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,950
Is he going crazy?!

130
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,910
He's sucking the Master's
poison gas up voluntarily!

131
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,540
--He inhaled it all!
--He'll be dead soon!

132
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,090
I've never seen an idiot like that!

133
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,490
Go to hell!

134
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,470
What?!

135
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,640
What?!

136
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,650
Poisons don't work so well
against me now, I guess.

137
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,240
Thanks to Magellan.

138
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,700
Magellan?! The venomous
fool from Impel Down?!

139
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,070
I'm not like that pathetic Paramecia eater!

140
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,790
Gum-Gum...

141
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,840
...Jet Mace!

142
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,460
Master!

143
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,810
Yeah!

144
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,120
How could he do that to our Master?!

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,020
I'll kill him!

146
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,060
Attack Straw Hat!

147
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah!

148
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,820
Stay out of it, weaklings!

149
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,080
W-Weaklings?

150
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,840
Did he call us "weaklings"?

151
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
Or did we hear him wrong?

152
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,180
That fool!

153
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,300
I'll show him my Gas-Gas Fruit power!

154
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,720
Armament Hardening!

155
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,190
Gum-Gum...

156
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,480
Come on!

157
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,860
...Gatling!

158
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,900
Gastanet!

159
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,860
What?

160
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,720
Luffy!

161
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,810
That's our Master!

162
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,760
Now, I'm gonna finish you off!

163
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,890
Smilies, wake up!

164
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,480
Smilies?

165
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,690
What?! All of a sudden, they're moving...

166
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,080
Smilies, cling onto Straw Hat!

167
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,450
Jump!

168
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,250
Why are they listening to the Master?!

169
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,210
Luffy, watch out! They'll explode!

170
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,110
Luffy!

171
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,760
Go away!

172
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,260
Gastanet!

173
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,700
Luffy!

174
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,930
Straw Hat's gone!

175
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,390
That was a huge explosion! I don't
think there is even a hair left!

176
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,920
He wasn't strong enough to fight against
our Master, the savior, in the first place!

177
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,260
No... Luffy!

178
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,390
You've got to be kidding!

179
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,320
I'm the greatest scientist in the
world, eater of the Gas-Gas Fruit!

180
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,140
You shouldn't have made me mad!

181
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,120
Master! Master!

182
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,990
Master! Master! Master...

183
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,090
You didn't know who you were messing with!

184
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,620
Oh, that was close!

185
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,690
What?!

186
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,500
What?!

187
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,770
What?!

188
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,000
Gum-Gum...

189
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,740
...Jet Stamp!

190
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,110
M-Master!

191
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,070
That was a big explosion.

192
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,380
That fool! Did he avoid the
explosion? How fast can he move?!

193
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,840
What a relief.

194
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,180
--S-Straw Hat?!
--Is he invincible?

195
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,670
All right!

196
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,290
How dare you do that to our Master?!

197
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,960
Move out of my way!

198
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,980
Okay, I really got you this time!

199
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,530
Master!

200
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,760
Robin! Franky! Is there anything
that I can put him in?

201
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,920
He's a Logia eater so
tying him up won't do it.

202
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,530
Isn't there a barrel or something?

203
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,980
Whoa-whoa, hold on, Straw Hat!

204
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,830
We, the Navy G-5, are taking him into
custody and putting you guys under arrest!

205
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,800
Fools, be ready for it!

206
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,110
Smoker-san, Straw Hat and
his crew caught Caesar!

207
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,410
Dammit, those fools!

208
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,510
Smoker-san!

209
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,650
Let's go, guys!

210
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,290
Follow Smo-yan and Captain-chan!

211
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,220
Yeah!

212
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,730
You can't escape, Straw Hat!

213
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,080
Straw Hat?

214
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
Luffy?

215
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,250
You shouldn't underestimate me.

216
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,940
Luffy!

217
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,070
Oh no!

218
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,430
Robin! I'll draw their attention to me!

219
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,810
You go and save Luffy!

220
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,790
Be careful! That guy's really tough!

221
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,850
What did you do to Luffy?!

222
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,670
Get out of my way!

223
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,630
Strong...

224
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,820
Right!

225
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,840
You're next!

226
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,100
Franky Radical...

227
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,040
...Beam!

228
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,850
Wing!

229
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,340
Luffy!

230
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,570
Robin!

231
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,280
She passed out all of a sudden!

232
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,120
What happened to her?!

233
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,250
Everyone, get out of here now!

234
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,420
Tashigi!

235
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,820
Captain-chan!

236
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,850
Robin, are you alright?!

237
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,560
Robin, stay with me!

238
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,120
Luffy!

239
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,960
You bastard!

240
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,820
Strong...

241
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,380
Ri...

242
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,290
Damn! What's going on here?!

243
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,880
I have them all now!

244
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,690
CAESAR'S LABORATORY LAW'S GROUP

245
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,210
Law?

246
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,940
Who is it?

247
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,550
What's wrong?

248
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,660
Oh no. You look like you're in pain.

249
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,180
Who is there?!

250
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,890
It's me.

251
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,080
Why are you...

252
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,480
...here?!

253
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,380
It's been years.

254
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,680
You've grown up.

255
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,390
Law.

256
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,830
Sanji manages to make it out
of the poisonous lake safely,

257
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,210
but there's little time to rejoice.

258
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,640
They end up surrounded by Smileys,

259
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,260
and are unable to escape from this crisis.

260
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,060
It's in this hopeless situation,
where the samurai reveals his true power.

261
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,110
On the next episode of One Piece!

262
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,470
"A Samurai Who Can Cut Fire!
Foxfire Kin'emon!"

263
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
