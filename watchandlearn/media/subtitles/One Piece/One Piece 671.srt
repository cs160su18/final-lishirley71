Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,460
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,270

We can't wait until the morning (I can't wait)

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:12,670
Why not drag the sun out into the sky

Yes, Shining! Running! Forever

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,410
Put the pieces of our dreams together

27

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,130
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

We are the one! Go ahead!

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,020
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,950
kokoro no chizu hirogete

59
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,950
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,120
The bond with potential power will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,120
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" tsukamitoru

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,690
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,960
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,680
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,320
However, no one has ever
fully explored it except for

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,430
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,050
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

70
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,370
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,710
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,870
Luffy and the others formed
a pirate alliance with

75
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,050
Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,760
Luffy entered a fighting competition
- in which a winner will get

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,150
the Flare-Flare Fruit as the prize - and won the first round

78
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,300
but now, he's heading for the
palace to take back Law who's

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,230
been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,100
We're gonna head for the palace!

81
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,470
And...

82
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,490
...beat the hell out of Doflamingo!

83
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,510
At the Colosseum,
the final round of the competition started.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,310
Shockwave...

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Dragon Claw!

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,170
Meanwhile, at the underground trade port,

87
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,940
the Tontattas started to
put Operation SOP into action.

88
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,890
With this world's hottest grape
made of Tatababasco Sauce,

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,080
I'm gonna knock Sugar out!

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,890
Even if he can shoot a fly, he can't shoot me
because...

91
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,090
...I'm quicker!

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,290
Wait, Leo!

93
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,030
Robiland?!

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,830
That's our commander!

95
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,840
Alright! We're taking control of the lift now!

96
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,580
I guess you do have some fight in you.

97
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's run away from the stone man!

98
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,600
He's not gonna go down easily!

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,210
We're trapped!

100
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,220
Luffy, take her and go on!

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,330
Leave him up to me!

102
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,850
You go ahead and kick Doflamingo's ass!

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,440
"Defeat Sugar!
The Army of the Little People Charges!"

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,280
This stone guy is gonna get cut!

105
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,910
Okay! I'll be counting on you!

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,320
I'm gonna fight you!

107
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,670
It's gonna block our way!

108
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,690
It's coming from behind, too!

109
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,730
I said I'm gonna fight you!

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,310
Three-Sword Style!

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,840
Onigiri!

112
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,110
Gum-Gum...

113
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,640
...Stamp!

114
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,440
Let's go!

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,410
Okay!

116
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,920
Black Rope Dragon Twister!

117
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,790
Now you're quiet all of a sudden?

118
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,830
One-Sword Style...

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,320
...Iai...

120
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,910
...Death Lion Song!

121
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,650
Commander!

122
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,120
How arro"g"ant of you
to think you can invade the palace!

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,360
There's the "G"!

124
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,260
I'm gonna get there at any cost and...

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,500
...take down Doflamingo!

126
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,150
THE ROYAL PALACE 1F

127
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,550
Commander!

128
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,930
Commander!

129
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,330
This is no good! If nothing is done,
not only can we not defeat Doflamingo,

130
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,900
but we won't be able to save our people
who're working at the factory as slaves!

131
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,870
IN THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT

132
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,580
We haven't had any new workers for a year.

133
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah. I heard they don't even come to the palace.

134
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,950
LUMINOUS FLOWERS "ELEGANT SUNFLOWERS"

135
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,790
Who is taking a break?!

136
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,160
THE MAN-MADE DEVIL FRUITS -
SMILE MANUFACTURING FACTORY

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
N-Not us!

138
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,400
When 500 of your people didn't come back,
you'd think there's something wrong.

139
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,220
But the Tontattas don't think
somebody's doing something bad.

140
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,180
That's why they're so dumb...

141
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,920
I mean, pure.

142
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Then, why don't they come
around here anymore?

143
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,190
I don't know.

144
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,190
Well, if they don't come,
we'll just keep making these 500 work like hell!

145
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,830
Too slow! Here's a lesson in tough-love!

146
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,430
Hey, hey! This SMILE is unripe!

147
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,900
Are you okay?!

148
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,110
I thought you Tontattas could grow any plant!

149
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,490
W-We can!

150
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,260
But SMILEs are very unnatural fruits.

151
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,570
No excuses!

152
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,360
Could you give my brother
a few minutes to rest?

153
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,090
Today's meal was a little spoiled.

154
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,020
Now you're complaining about your meal?

155
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,720
Don't you wanna cure
your princess Mancherie's illness?

156
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,600
W-We do!

157
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,420
Then, make more SMILEs!

158
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,440
It's the only medication for her illness!

159
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,120
The average number of
acceptable fruits you produce

160
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,950
in one season is still less
than one out of every ten!

161
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,420
Use your head and
increase the production rate!

162
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,920
Could we see Princess Mancherie?

163
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,940
No!

164
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,500
W-Why?!

165
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Because...

166
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,460
If you pick up her disease,

167
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,710
we would be devastated!

168
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,780
You Tontattas are important partners to us!

169
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,030
S-Sanshita-san!

170
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,450
We're gonna work very hard!

171
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,340
Please take good care of our princess!

172
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,680
Alright!

173
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,440
How could they believe in such a lie?

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,900
Wh-What are you doing, Robiland?!

175
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,950
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,470
But if I didn't stop you,
you would've been taken down.

177
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

178
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,000
The fly that got shot...

179
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,820
This is...

180
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,440
It was so tiny
but it was shot right between the eyes.

181
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,360
Trebol's dynamic vision
and ability are exceptional.

182
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,290
I think it's too dangerous to approach Sugar
while he's protecting her!

183
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,640
What should we do then, Robiland?

184
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,870
We should separate Trebol from Sugar!

185
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,950
It's easier said than done.

186
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,280
Usoland! Tell us what to do!

187
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,170
What?!

188
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,990
Our legendary hero - Usoland!

189
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,590
Y-You can count on me.

190
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,690
Put it there.

191
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,570
Hey, what's wrong with that load?!

192
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,640
There is a swarm of pink hornets!

193
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,510
I'm here to report, Trebol-sama!

194
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,760
We have a problem with
Captain Yves' pirate group in

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,920
trade port district 4!

196
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,450
They're going wild saying they
want to talk to an Executive

197
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,790
about the price!

198
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,330
Aren't they afraid of Joker's name?
They must have a lot of nerve!

199
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Hey, did they change the person
in charge of reporting?

200
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,340
He's out to lunch now!

201
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,400
And it's an emergency!

202
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,440
We have a few casualties on our side!
Please help us!

203
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Casualties?

204
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,290
Alright, I'm coming!

205
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,440
Hey, hey!

206
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,430
Yes!

207
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,150
Trebol-sama, are you gonna go somewhere?

208
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,780
Tighten security at the four doors
to the Executive Tower.

209
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,470
Yes, sir!

210
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,370
But if something happens,
let me know immediately!

211
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,430
Y-Yes, sir!

212
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,730
Trebol-sama!

213
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,050
Thank you for your leadership!

214
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,790
Hey, hey!

215
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,070
Where is it? Where are they fighting?

216
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,040
District 4.

217
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,230
What? Aren't you gonna fight for us?

218
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,110
I could easily handle this.

219
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,420
But I'd better do nothing!

220
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,010
I'll just stay and watch
so you can build your self-confidence!

221
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,370
Self-confidence?

222
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,690
I see!

223
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,340
Now we understand!

224
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,830
Don't worry! If something goes wrong,
I'll make everything right for you!

225
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,720
That's good to know!

226
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
We'll follow you to the end!

227
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,520
The legendary hero - Usoland!

228
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,840
Th-That's me.

229
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,310
Who is it?

230
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,980
I'm gonna go now!

231
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,230
Oh! He did it!

232
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,870
Now we wait for her to eat the
clump of Tatababasco Sauce,

233
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,480
the hottest spice in the world!

234
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,450
That's not it!

235
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,000
Eat the right one this time!

236
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,630
Idiot! Don't scream!

237
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,440
If Operation Sugar Oversurprised and Panic fails,

238
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,750
it's gonna ruin all of our plans!

239
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,830
We have no choice!

240
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,090
Uh-huh!

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,900
Don't fight back, Sugar!

242
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,240
Those fools!

243
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,550
We're here to take back our friends
who're working like slaves in the factory!

244
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,050
And we're gonna knock you out!

245
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,380
Knock me down?

246
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,520
But I don't know anything about your friends.

247
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,620
What?!

248
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,720
Really?!

249
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,260
What?!

250
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,940
Uh-huh.

251
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,140
All right, then!

252
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,230
It's not all right! Don't be fooled!

253
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,670
Oh, that was close!
Give us back our friends!

254
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,060
Who's putting this idea in your heads?!

255
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,570
There's no way that you dummies notice
that you've been fooled, yourself.

256
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,340
You Tontattas...

257
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,450
You haven't come to the palace
for a year or so, but...

258
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,010
...I guess that's because
somebody talked you into something.

259
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,990
Charge!

260
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,120
Restrain her and open her mouth!

261
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,430
I don't like it. They think I'm weak.

262
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,800
Little Black Bears!

263
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,380
Here is the contract.

264
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,180
Oh no! She has turned us into toys!

265
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,430
You must follow my orders until you die!

266
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,290
Did they forget about us?!

267
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,750
Oh? Oh?

268
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,250
Some toys have appeared from nowhere!

269
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,260
What were we doing now?

270
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,530
Kill everyone in the Executive Tower!

271
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,840
I can't help myself from following her orders!

272
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,040
Kill everyone? Including me?!

273
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,910
No! I don't wanna fight!

274
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,840
They must be Sugar's subordinates!

275
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,390
I didn't know there were bodyguards
other than Trebol!

276
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,840
Leo! It's me! Flapper!

277
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,460
Take down the enemies!

278
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,400
No! No!

279
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,170
No! Nooo!!

280
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,100
Trebol, come back here!
It was a trap!

281
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,670
Trebol!

282
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,510
A trap?

283
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,640
Hey!

284
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,710
Look at that! Trebol-sama!

285
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,020
The pirates are running wild
and there's nothing we can do!

286
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,390
Hey, hey! You guys!

287
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,830
What's the problem here?

288
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,490
Trebol-sama!

289
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,500
Hey! What is it?!

290
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,830
Well, it's just there was a swarm of bees
on a load!

291
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,190
We have no problem with the deal itself.

292
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,170
That tramp!

293
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,830
Hey, hey! Wait up, wait up!

294
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,940
You bitch!

295
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,880
Hey! Who are you and
where did you come from? Hey?

296
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,150
She vanished!

297
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,930
Hey! Hey!

298
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,080
Don't tell me she's... I know her face!

299
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,450
Is she a member of the Straw Hats?!

300
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,310
How did she get here?!

301
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,790
Trebol!

302
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,510
Why do they wanna attack Sugar?

303
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,720
Come back here now! You've been fooled!
Good-for-nothing idiot! Drop dead!

304
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,820
I'm losing it!

305
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,020
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

306
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,840
Stick-Stickem...

307
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,450
What's going on?!

308
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,050
...Meteora!

309
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,590
The furious Trebol's powerful attack
devastates Leo and the others.

310
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,080
The only hope left for the King Riku Army
is the Toy Soldier!

311
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,280
Once known as "The Legend"
throughout Dressrosa,

312
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,980
his true identity is close to being revealed!

313
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,290
Next on One Piece:

314
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,890
"The Last Light of Hope!
The Secret of Our Commander!"

315
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!
