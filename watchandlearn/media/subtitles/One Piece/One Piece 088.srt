00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,900
You can't break it!

22
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,880
The skull mark is a symbol of faith!

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,650
Luffy!

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,110
It's a direct hit!

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,100
"Zoan-Type Devil Fruit!
Chopper's Seven-Form Transformation"

26
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,410
He must've been blown away!
Such an idiot!

27
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,220
Ahh!

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,720
Ahhh...

29
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,980
See? It didn't break!

30
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,940
What?! Can't be... He's stupid!

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,910
I don't know who the heck
this pirate flag belongs to...

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,440
but since this flag is a person's
pledge to risk his life...

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,790
it's not raised as a joke!

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,020
This flag isn't something you can
just break while laughing foolishly!

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,100
Incredible...

36
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,600
So this is... a pirate!

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,030
This is a symbol of the belief
that nothing is impossible!

38
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,540
I will save this country as a doctor!

39
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,190
By raising this,
I'll fight just like pirates do!

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,620
What are pirates?

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,480
Pirates are incredible guys at sea.

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,480
It's cool to be a pirate!
There're tons of incredible guys at sea!

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,320
Chopper, go out to sea some day.

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
--Hey, reindeer!

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,260
--Hmm?
--Hey, reindeer!

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm gonna beat these guys up now.
What do you wanna do?

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,380
I...

48
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,840
What're you saying? You damn idiot!

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
If you wanna protect the flag that bad,
stay there forever to protect it!

50
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,400
Why don't you stop... right there!

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,230
Hmm?!

52
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,780
Ow!

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,070
Looks like your backbone gave out...

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,700
That's just natural.
You're moving around too much!

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,020
Stop, doctor's orders!

56
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,560
What're you idiots doing?!

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,760
Just stand there and watch!
I'll blow him to bits along with that flag!

58
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,140
Time to get blown away, Straw Hat!

59
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,980
Stop it!

60
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,190
That's the idea! Get him, reindeer!

61
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,610
Wapol-sama! Watch out!

62
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,540
The little brat is showing his guts
as if he's a fully grown man...

63
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,500
Sorry. I won't let you lay
your finger on Wapol-sama!

64
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,020
Really, there are some strange
creatures in this world.

65
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,940
Seems like you're that "yeti" the citizens
got worked up about at one time.

66
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,120
You must really have spent your
whole life disliked by everyone.

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,600
You poor monster. Why's a loner like
you trying to save this country?

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,860
Don't make me laugh!

69
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,520
Shut up! Even if I don't have friends,
I can still fight!

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
As long as Doctor's flag exists, I will...

71
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
You do have friends!

72
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,880
I am your friend!

73
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,390
Straw Hat!

74
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,460
Are you okay?!

75
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,650
I'm just fine...
since I'm a rubber man.

76
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,360
A rubber man?!

77
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,450
Hey, reindeer. Can you finish that guy?

78
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,950
Someone like that is a piece of cake.

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,950
Then it's decided.

80
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,380
My opponent is the annoying mouth!

81
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,260
How dare you, Straw Hat,
flying around like that!

82
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,990
I won't hesitate any longer!

83
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,050
You can take me down?!
Huh, you monster?!

84
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,820
How dare you...

85
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,100
Old hag! I will fight...

86
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,480
Shut up and watch!

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,110
If you keep moving around, you won't
be able to walk on your own anymore.

88
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,070
Don't worry. When push comes to shove,
my reindeer can handle things.

89
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,450
My name is Tony Tony Chopper!

90
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,330
It's a name that the world's
greatest doctor gave me!

91
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,920
Even if Doctor forgave you,

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,470
I won't forgive you for
laughing at how he lived!

93
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm the one who'll show
no forgiveness! I'll stomp you!

94
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,610
Rumble Ball!

95
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Dalton-san! Dalton-san! Wake up!

96
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200
Please! Dalton-san!

97
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,190
Vivi...

98
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,620
Hey! Dalton-san! Dalton-san!

99
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,750
Dalton is still alive.

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,540
The Twenty MDs!

101
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,930
His body is frozen. That's all.

102
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,550
Will you leave him in our care?

103
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,630
Hey, there are doctors.

104
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,960
I thought I heard that there weren't
any doctors in this country...

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,160
These guys're called the Twenty MDs
and they exclusively work for Wapol.

106
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,770
In other words, they're bad doctors!

107
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,150
That's right! We can't trust you!

108
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,920
Leave Dalton-san in your care when
you gave in to Wapol... to the king?!

109
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,990
What're you going to do to Dalton-san?!

110
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,490
If you want to save him,
just do what we say!

111
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,190
We are still doctors.

112
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,920
Even though we were forced to give
in by Wapol and his men's power,

113
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,280
we've always worked to advance
our medical research...

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,880
for the patients in this country!

115
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,540
It was because a certain quack
taught us not to give up.

116
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,910
We can't lose any more...
stupid men like him!

117
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,280
The effect of the Rumble Ball
lasts 3 minutes.

118
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll take you down in 3 minutes!

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,850
3 minutes?!

120
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,280
You can't defeat me at all,
much less in 3 minutes!

121
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,740
3 minutes? That's amazing!

122
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,200
3 minutes? That's amazing!

123
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,520
We'll be able to see something interesting.

124
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,150
Dammit! Let me fight, too!

125
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,220
Rumble!

126
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,900
What... did you say you could do?!

127
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,500
Marimo's Snow Melting Arrow!

128
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,770
Walk Point! Leg boost!

129
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,900
Whoa!

130
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,800
Humph! Just a transformation?!
I was expecting something more!

131
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,520
In other words, you have
the powers of a devil fruit.

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,870
Zoan-type, just like Dalton!
A reindeer human, huh?!

133
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,400
Heavy Point! Weight Boost!

134
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,290
I'm a human reindeer!

135
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,680
Same difference!

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,260
I know everything about the three-form
transformation you Zoan-types use.

137
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,800
Marimo's Super Surprise Quattro Hammer!

138
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,220
I've seen all your forms.

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,940
Looks like you're a
power fighter like Dalton.

140
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,190
But there's no way you can...

141
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,200
Jumping Point! Jump Boost!

142
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,420
...outpower me!

143
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,980
He jumped! He can really jump!

144
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,450
Whoa!

145
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,780
What?! What's that form?!

146
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,130
Wasn't his "human-animal form" the little
reindeer from earlier?! How impudent!

147
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,760
Guard Point! Fur Boost!

148
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,850
Again?!

149
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,310
Whoa!

150
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,740
Can't be... I hit him dead on!

151
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,240
It won't work!

152
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,360
I was sure that Zoan-types
had a limit of three forms.

153
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
What the heck are you?

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,130
The Rumble Ball is a drug

155
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,070
that messes up the wavelength
of the devil fruit's transformations.

156
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,410
During my 5 years of research,
I found 4 more transformation points.

157
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,170
3 transformations plus 4.

158
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,180
Seven-form transformation?

159
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,120
Sev...

160
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,100
What's the big deal with the
number of transformations?!

161
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,060
A... A seven-form transforming
interesting reindeer!

162
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,460
What's the matter with him?

163
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,070
Looks like his happiness exceeded its limit
after hearing seven-phase transformation.

164
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,470
You bastard... What happened
to your fight against me?!

165
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,510
To hell with seven-phase transformation!

166
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,840
I won't be deceived by such a sham!

167
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,720
It's not a sham!

168
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,640
Arm Point! Arm Boost!

169
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,880
Let me tell you one thing.
My iron hooves can smash even rocks!

170
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,460
Amazing!

171
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,340
How impudent, you bastard!

172
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,300
This'll show you! Marimo's Surprise...

173
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,270
Quattro Axe!

174
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,740
Snow Splitting Blade!

175
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,780
Hey... The castle wall got hollowed out!

176
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,960
Tsk! He dodged it.

177
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,010
Then, how about... this?!

178
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,180
Omnidirectional Snow Splitter!

179
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,490
What happened to your
high spirits from earlier?!

180
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,140
You can't win if you just
keep dodging, you know!

181
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,860
Brain Point! Brain Boost!

182
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,420
It's not that I was just dodging.

183
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,300
I was looking for your weak spot.

184
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,160
What?!

185
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,610
This will finish you. Scope!

186
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,090
A... A beam!
He'll definitely shoot a beam!

187
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,870
He won't, you idiot!

188
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,600
Shut up! It's definitely a beam!

189
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,080
I don't care what anyone says,
it's a beam!

190
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,380
--What else could it be?! It's a beam!
--How can you know?! Huh?!

191
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,420
--I just know! It's a beam! Beam!
--How can you know?! Huh?!

192
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,680
--I just know! It's a beam! Beam!
--Then what kind of beam?!

193
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,020
I should use this chance...

194
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,480
You were looking for
my weak spot?! So what?!

195
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,740
I don't have a blind spot!

196
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,970
You're a transforming idiot
who can't even attack!

197
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,330
You're the one who'll be finished!

198
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,330
I found it!

199
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,040
His jaw!

200
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,230
Where'd he go?!

201
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,940
Hoofprint...

202
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,640
...Roseo!

203
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,390
3 minutes.

204
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,980
All right, reindeer!
You're pretty good, reindeer! Amazing!

205
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,810
Shut up!

206
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,820
--Dalton-san!
--Dalton-san!

207
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,810
In any event, let's go up the mountain,
Usopp-san, Mr. Bushido!

208
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,170
Huh?

209
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,640
I can't just sit around and wait!

210
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,210
I'm worried what happened to Luffy-san
and the others in that big avalanche!

211
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,660
Nami-san has a very high fever!
If anything happened...

212
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,180
You're worried about Nami...

213
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,140
On top of that, you're worried about
Dalton-san as well as Alabasta, huh?

214
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,070
Vivi, calm down! You're carrying
too many burdens on your shoulders!

215
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,220
What?

216
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,800
Nami is with Luffy and Sanji.
I'm sure she's okay.

217
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,030
They'll be fine! I believe in them!

218
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,300
That's right... He's right...

219
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,140
Usopp-san believes in his friends.

220
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,520
That's why he can be so calm.

221
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,670
Thank you, Usopp-san. I...

222
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,710
For you, it's just that you're afraid
of going up the mountain, isn't it?

223
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,640
B... But I heard that there're things
like a yeti and bear-bunnies there!

224
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Then say so from the start!

225
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,280
It'll be fine. It's Luffy we're
talking about. He'll make it work.

226
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,610
I can't help it if I'm scared!
Any problem with that?!

227
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,820
Dalton-san!

228
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,190
W-Wait!

229
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,400
Ahh! Dalton-san!

230
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,570
Dalton-san!

231
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,800
Would someone please tell me
who the heck this guy is?!

232
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,280
Dalton-san! You can't!

233
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,130
Get out of my way! We can't
let Wapol in the castle! Never!

234
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,690
Don't tell me you're
heading to the castle!

235
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,630
In your condition... that's reckless!

236
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,290
When will I fight if I don't fight now?

237
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,600
If Wapol goes back to being the king,
this country will become rotten forever!

238
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,460
There's no way you can fight
in that condition!

239
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,070
We're no match for them, either...

240
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,490
I will settle this! No matter
how dirty I have to play!

241
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,630
Get on my back.
I'll take you to the castle.

242
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,760
You don't need to be modest!

243
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,090
I don't wanna waste your
determination. That's all.

244
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,920
Usopp-san...

245
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,310
Hold on, okay? I will take you...
to the castle now...

246
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,230
Usopp-san...

247
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Hey, Usopp-kun. I really don't
think this is going to work...

248
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,590
It'll work! I'll take you there!

249
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,170
You're gonna fight for the country, right?!
You're gonna settle this, right?!

250
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,670
Don't worry. I'll definitely take you there!

251
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,470
Geez... that moron...

252
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,060
We just have to go up the mountain, right?

253
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,670
Zoro...

254
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,280
--You jerk! You jerk! Usopp Punch!

255
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,860
--Ow! Ow! What're you doing?!
--You jerk! You jerk! Usopp Punch!

256
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,530
I was just about to use my serious power!

257
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,490
Yeah... I know.

258
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,190
--Serious Power!

259
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,950
--Whoa, amazing, amazing...
--Serious Power!

260
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,200
Wait! If you're willing to
go that far to get there...

261
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,150
...there's a ropeway to the castle.

262
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,380
Can't be. There's no rope
connected to the castle any more.

263
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,010
There's one. Someone has
reattached a white rope...

264
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,890
...from a big tree at the
edge of Gyasta to the castle!

265
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,980
Gyasta?

266
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,460
That's the name of the town
that Dr. Kureha headed last.

267
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,870
Hey, Luffy!

268
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,890
Huh?

269
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,990
Where is that guy?

270
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,850
That guy?

271
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,990
He's not here!

272
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,930
Which guy?

273
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,230
That tin bastard! He's disappeared!

274
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,650
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!

275
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,250
He came up on the haired hippo.
He wouldn't go down on his own.

276
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,840
When on earth did he...

277
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,880
While you were fascinated by
the transformations, of course!

278
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,840
That bastard! I'll find him
right away and finish him off!

279
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,040
Don't tell me he got into
the castle from somewhere...

280
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,300
If that's the case, Nami-san will be...

281
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,830
That bastard! If he lays
his hands on Nami-san,

282
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,310
--Hold it!
--I'll gut him 100 times!

283
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,270
Geez, does he want to die?

284
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,910
Doctorine...

285
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,720
Hmm?

286
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,240
He called me...

287
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,120
his friend...

288
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,460
Where're you, annoying mouth?!

289
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,090
Seems like my fever is
coming down quite a bit.

290
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,250
At this rate, it's likely that
I can go back to the ship soon.

291
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,410
What am I doing?!

292
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,160
This is no time to be in bed resting here!
Vivi is waiting for me!

293
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,000
What the heck is going on here?!

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,570
Is this really my Drum Castle?

295
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,290
What have they done to my castle?

296
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,910
They won't get away with this!

297
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,460
I will chew up every single one of them!

298
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,170
Even this sleepless town
has dozed off for now

299
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:36,830
From today forth,
something's going to change

300
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:46,620
I'm sure I can start fresh,
since I'm not alone

301
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:57,290
Just by having you by my side,
I feel I can become strong

302
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:08,030
I wonder how far I can go,
towards the place that leads to the future

303
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,380
Off in the distance it shines,
encompassing the world

304
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,040
Before dawn

305
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,040
I should get out of here quickly
while Doctorine isn't around!

306
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,010
That bastard! I'll find him
right away and finish him off!

307
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,760
If he lays his hands on Nami-san,
I'll gut him 100 times!

308
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,630
Oh no! He looks like a bad guy!

309
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,400
I've cornered you, annoying mouth!

310
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,890
Dalton-san's got dynamites!

311
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,270
I have no idea what's going on here.

312
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,600
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,400
"When The Kingdom's Rule Ends!
The Flag of Faith Flies Forever"

314
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
