2
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,670
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

18
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,680
God only knows.

19
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,350
Nami's group headed for the
eastern shore to escape Upper Yard,

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,950
but Eneru appeared, charred Sanji
and Usopp, and then vanished.

21
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,910
My name is Hotori!

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,140
My name is Kotori!

23
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,570
As if taking his place,

24
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,050
Satori's twin brothers Kotori and
Hotori showed up, bent on revenge.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,140
I have to protect them!

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,240
Meanwhile, the four who headed
south for the ancient ruins

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,930
ran into a giant snake
and wound up separated.

28
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,200
Descendants built this after the city fell...

29
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,530
Shandora... That was this
ancient city's name...

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Who's there?!

31
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,380
Where am I?!

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,700
Nothing personal.

33
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,470
I accept this survival challenge!

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
How careless of me!

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,630
Is this guy an idiot?!

36
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,180
They each encounter enemies
and are drawn into battle.

37
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,190
Among them, Chopper fought
and defeated Priest Gedatsu.

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,020
Cloven...

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
...Cross!

40
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,270
"Unbeatable Powers!
Eneru's True Form is Revealed"

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,980
You alright, Kamakiri?!

42
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,150
Don't worry about me!
Pay attention to your surroundings!

43
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,550
Look!

44
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,640
I can see the cloud-covered Giant Jack!

45
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,940
The ruins of Shandora are near!

46
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,880
Eneru is at the top!

47
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,720
You called?

48
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm right here.

49
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,110
Do you want something?

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,430
Warrior of Shandora, Kamakiri...

51
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,250
Eneru! Damn you!

52
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,890
Who do you think you're talking to?

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,840
I am God, you know.

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,030
You seem absolutely baffled
as to why I've appeared here.

55
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,490
Mantra?!

56
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,340
I don't need that to see what's
written all over your face!

57
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,760
Though, I don't blame you.

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,670
Normally, I wouldn't need to
bother doing anything personally,

59
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,480
but I happen to be a player in
this survival game, too, you see...

60
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,340
Plus, I will soon be leaving this land.

61
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,110
In fact, I just finished
saying goodbye to Gan Fall.

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,030
You think this is a game?! Like hell it is!

63
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,740
You look like you really
want to get rid of me...

64
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,240
Sure.

65
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,510
I will reward you for all
your hard work as a warrior,

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,190
as an act of God's charity.

67
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,540
Hmm... how does five minutes sound?

68
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,170
I will sit right here for five minutes' time.

69
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,230
What?!

70
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,550
I will neither dodge your
attacks nor strike back.

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,390
Go ahead and do your worst.

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,440
Why, you...!

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,050
But, once those five minutes are up...

74
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,150
...you will come to learn what God is
from the bottom of your heart.

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,940
Damn you!

76
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,370
Time to die, Eneru!

77
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,050
Damn you!

78
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,720
You missed!

79
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,630
Stop!

80
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,640
I said stop!

81
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,950
Nope!

82
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,340
Nope!

83
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,770
I said stop it!

84
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,940
They're unconscious!

85
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,590
So what?!

86
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,050
So what?!

87
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,490
These guys killed our brother Satori!

88
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,560
Killed!

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
They must pay!

90
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,830
Why, you...!

91
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,410
Got an Impact!

92
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,950
Impact?!

93
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,490
Peeyew! What is this...?!

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,890
I stored farts in a Flavor Dial!

95
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,730
I see. So they have four types of dials...

96
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,660
That's right!

97
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,570
Axe! Flame!

98
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,640
Impact! Flavor!

99
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,900
Got those memorized?!

100
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,410
There's no way to distinguish us!

101
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,010
Which is Hotori, and which is Kotori?!

102
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,330
Which hand has what?
It'll be fun to find out!

103
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,560
Surprise Dial Illusion!

104
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,330
We know what they have!
We cannot waste time!

105
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,130
I don't give a damn who's who!

106
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,840
Here comes a typhoon!

107
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,080
You missed!

108
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,130
You missed!

109
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,820
Now, what dial is on my right hand?!

110
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,180
Yet another fart! Dummies!

111
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,850
Did you expect flames?!
Those are from my right hand!

112
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,070
He's going to ignite the gas!

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,580
Weird knight!

114
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,330
Fool! He got sent flying!

115
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,880
Eh?!

116
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,780
That sounds like something
a fool would think.

117
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,590
You underestimated me...

118
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,100
Kotori!

119
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,940
Come back!

120
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
Cyclone Tempo.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,990
You... Girl...

122
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,550
Finish him off with my gauntlet down below!

123
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,050
Weird knight! Did your wounds open?!

124
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,200
Never mind me! He'll be back soon!

125
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,670
Gauntlet?

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,520
Gauntlet... Gauntlet... Gauntlet?!

127
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,490
Hey, what's a gauntlet?!

128
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,490
Whoa, it's heavy!

129
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,170
It is made of Blue Sea iron.

130
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,060
There is an Impact Dial inside it.
Use it just as I explained.

131
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,060
I think I understand, but I can't
use this thing, it's too heavy...

132
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,820
You'll pay!

133
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Guess this is no time to
be worried about that!

134
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,580
First big brother Satori,
then little brother Kotori...!

135
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Not even praying will save you now!

136
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,080
He's the flame guy, right?

137
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,060
He's sopping wet, plus the
air is full of moisture!

138
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,960
Cool Ball!

139
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,120
Huh? That's just cold. Is that it?!

140
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,930
Yep, that's it! You use fire, right?

141
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,810
You're mocking me! Are you trying
to use this against my Flame Dial?!

142
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,660
I'll burn you up!

143
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,280
Hot air flowing above collected
cool air causes moisture to condense!

144
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,290
Yes... It becomes fog!

145
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,700
Fog Tempo!

146
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,190
What the...?! Fog!

147
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,130
I can't see! What is this?!

148
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,670
What... the...?!

149
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,490
You! What are you--?!

150
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,840
Pardon me a sec!

151
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,220
Impact.

152
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,570
Owww!

153
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,860
My arm's coming off!

154
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,030
How could you make me
use this, you weird knight?!

155
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,500
It won't hurt for long.
But you did wonderfully, girl!

156
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,810
Urgh...!

157
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,210
But... Yes! We protected the ship and crew!

158
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,270
Uhh, do you mind if I call you Aisa-san?

159
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,070
Can you really tell where the
Blue Sea folks' ship is headed?

160
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,790
Yeah...

161
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,940
What a mysterious power...

162
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,370
Being able to hear people in
the forest from this far away...

163
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,870
But are you all right?
You've been shaking for a while now!

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,220
It's just...

165
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,670
It's just, I've never
felt this afraid before.

166
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,360
Everyone's voices...

167
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,200
Everyone's voices are
disappearing more and more...

168
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,610
Yes, I'm sorry. Let's just hurry, Conis-san.

169
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,360
Yes, Father.

170
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,520
Hold on! Where are you going, weird knight?!

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,740
Sorry, but I must follow Eneru.

172
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,450
What?! You're just gonna
leave a lady all by herself?!

173
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,020
Again, I am sorry.

174
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,760
I am curious as to why Eneru has
sprung into action at this point.

175
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,330
Could it be...?

176
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,170
Could it be what?

177
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,040
When Eneru appeared, he captured
650 of my Divine Squad members.

178
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,700
There is no time to give the details,
but my men's lives are in danger.

179
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,350
No, this entire land may be in danger...

180
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,100
Can you fly, Pierre?

181
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,360
Wait!

182
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,530
I will leave behind the Impact gauntlet.

183
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,400
Make do with that.

184
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,440
You can't be serious...

185
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,940
Hey, I said wait! You ingrate!

186
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,450
And you call yourself God?!

187
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,450
Come back! Reconsider!

188
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,470
I'll cry if you don't!

189
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,210
For now, I need to give
these guys first aid...

190
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,620
You're both alive, right?!

191
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,690
Hurry back, Chopper!

192
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,600
What?! What?! What?!

193
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,090
Nami-san! Heso!

194
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,780
Conis?!

195
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,380
Heso!

196
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,170
Mister!

197
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,660
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,980
Shut that horn up already!

199
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,480
Let go!

200
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,310
Wait... No! You can't get off!

201
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,460
Let go!

202
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,150
If you go any further in,
you'll never leave alive!

203
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,200
We agreed to leave right away!

204
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,100
Let go!

205
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,890
No!

206
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,100
Who's she?

207
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,380
Oh, this is Aisa...

208
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,420
Stay away, Blue Sea scum! I'll eliminate you!

209
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm a warrior of Shandora!

210
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,790
So? You gonna fight me?
Don't make me Impact you.

211
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,430
How terrible! They're both charred black!
They need first aid, quick!

212
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,470
In any case, I'm sorry. Set sail
along the new path we came on!

213
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,430
We used a Milky Dial to create a new river.

214
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,860
If you follow it, you can go
straight to the White-White Sea.

215
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,470
Hurry, before the enemy spots us...

216
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,810
Then couldn't you have come more quietly?!

217
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,550
Oh, yes. I also have something for you.

218
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,700
For me?

219
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,650
A waver!

220
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,530
I repaired the one you
brought from the Blue Sea.

221
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
Here. It belongs to you.

222
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,830
Wow! Really?!

223
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,440
Yes!

224
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,830
Sweet!

225
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,680
Still, this waver turned out
to be really something.

226
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,010
Eh?

227
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,820
Its power is beyond comparison. Sorry.

228
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,680
Oh, you're still at it?

229
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,450
Sorry. I must've dozed off there...

230
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,740
What's wrong? You seem to
be in pain, Kamakiri-kun...

231
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,200
As I promised, I haven't done anything...

232
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:19,820
I... can't... beat you...?

233
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,670
Yes, that's right.

234
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,890
Now do you understand?

235
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,500
I am lightning.

236
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,500
How can a struggling man defeat lightning?

237
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,340
As a native of the sky, you've surely
seen distant lightning before.

238
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,400
Since ancient times, man has replaced
all his fear of nature with God

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,350
to flee from the terror
he could not comprehend,

240
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,120
with the belief that all supernatural
phenomena are acts of God

241
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
beyond human understanding...

242
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,210
The disasters from the heavens,

243
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,410
which all of mankind
accepted as being unbeatable...

244
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
They are me.

245
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,390
Now do you understand what God is?

246
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh? A Breath Dial, huh?

247
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,820
Burn Blade!

248
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,060
I must tell Wyper!
There's no point in fighting him!

249
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,310
He'd only die in vain!

250
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,760
Even if he risks his life,
a Reject will have no effect!

251
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,200
So now you choose to run?

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,290
I gotta retreat and think! As things
are now... As things are now...!

253
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,270
Did you think you could
move faster than lightning?

254
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,590
Your five minutes are up.

255
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,890
Now it's my turn.

256
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,690
1 Million Volts... Vaari!

257
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,860
Run! Wyper!

258
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,220
What was that?

259
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,780
No!

260
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,260
What?! What?!

261
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,860
What's going on, all of a sudden?!
What happened?!

262
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,210
Their voices... are disappearing...!

263
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,730
Whoops. It seems the electricity
traveled along the Milky Road.

264
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,640
Twenty voices disappeared
after that discharge. Fools...

265
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,050
The 81-man Upper Yard survival game...

266
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,460
Two hours have passed.

267
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,610
56 have dropped out.

268
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,540
Thirteen of God's army remain.

269
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,870
Five of the Straw Hats remain.

270
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,460
Seven of the Shandians remain.

271
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,340
That makes for a total of twenty-five left...

272
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,740
Hmm. There are more left than I expected.

273
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,720
No matter. I'll corner
them all slowly but surely.

274
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,370
Who will get to accompany me in the end?

275
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,820
This necklace is made of gold!

276
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,210
Is the gold we're looking
for inside this cave?!

277
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,680
I'd rather be inside a
yakiniku shop right now...

278
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,600
Geez!

279
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,450
Where am I?!

280
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,880
Racing full speed ahead as always

281
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,630
A to Z, we run through it

282
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,430
We all have worries and fall many times

283
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,350
But we just need to rise to the top someday

284
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,820
What could be beyond the sea
in which the morning sun rises?

285
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:39,880
Let's go little by little toward
the brilliantly shining sun

286
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,380
I never treat you "bad"

287
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,080
How many times did we fall?

288
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:55,170
It's all right, we're definitely
pointing at tomorrow now

289
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,710
Smile! Come back to you, friends

290
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,520
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

291
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,440
Come back to you, friends

292
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Come back to you, friends
Come back to you, friends

293
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,980
Come back to you, friends

294
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,580
Damn! What's with this
cave?! Where's the exit?!

295
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,460
What are you doing there?!

296
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,560
Seriously! What, did you get lost?!

297
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,590
Same goes for you!

298
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,220
What?!

299
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,870
Man, I'm hungry!

300
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,520
Will you people be able to live
through this survival game?

301
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,000
On the next episode of One Piece!

302
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,260
"A Mystical City! The
Grand Ruins of Shandora!!"

303
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
