00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,120
God Eneru's plan was about
to enter its final stage.

18
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,640
Luffy challenged Eneru to a fight,

19
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,610
but after their intense struggle,
he plummeted off the ship.

20
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,810
What's the matter? You're lucky
enough to have made it this far.

21
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,890
Abandon those who are incompetent.

22
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,660
You must have a future you wish for, right?

23
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,560
A future I wish for... Yes, I do.

24
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,230
But if I just stay here and go with you,
it's the same as being alone.

25
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,190
There're actually a lot of things
I want and that I'd like to do,

26
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,470
but if I have to abandon those
guys and go with you like this...

27
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,580
...then I don't want anything anymore!!

28
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,580
God or not, if anyone
lays a finger on Nami-san...

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,450
...I'll become a devil of the Blue Sea!!

30
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,080
Nami-san!

31
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,020
"The Two Awaken! On the Front Lines
of the Burning Love Rescue!!"

32
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,470
"God"

33
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,270
If you do not wish to
remain aboard this ship...

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,600
...then you have but one fate.

35
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,190
Go to the afterlife.

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,930
There's no way I can
possibly stand up to this guy...

37
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,170
But I don't want to stay on this ship!
That's the truth! I regret nothing!

38
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,950
Though, of course, after having said that,

39
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,820
I doubt you think you can
get off the ship safely...

40
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,810
Or would you rather place your hope
in the two rats that've snuck on?

41
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,750
I wanna go down!

42
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,490
If we go any higher up, we won't
be able to go back down, Sanji!

43
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,910
Besides, however you put it, God is on board!

44
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,850
Now that we've started,
there's no turning back!

45
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,690
But what are we gonna do, Sanji?!

46
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,770
This ship's huge! There could
be hundreds of guys on board!

47
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,830
We can't possibly break through them all!

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,210
Plus, if God or the priests
show up, we're goners!

49
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,730
Just accept it already!

50
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,800
You're more eager than I am, always
carrying the right tools for stuff!

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,350
But I wasn't planning to do this!

52
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,020
Anyways, look!
We're dealing with Mantra-users!

53
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,100
There's no point in tryin' to be all sneaky!

54
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm sure they've been aware
of us for a long while now!

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
They know?! What're we gonna do?! Hey!

56
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,740
There's no point in worrying about it.

57
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,180
We'll split up inside and
head straight for the deck!

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,060
Nami-san is there!

59
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,780
What?! We're gonna split up?!

60
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Are you insane?! We don't know
how many enemies are on board!

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,740
Just getting up here was dangerous
enough! Why would we do that?!

62
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,000
Dumbass!

63
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,730
If we don't split up, we could both go down!

64
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,300
What's with that "one of
us is gonna die" tone?

65
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,610
Wait! Don't tell me you're--

66
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,720
Don't tell me you're gonna
sacrifice yourself for Nami?!

67
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,910
Listen, Usopp. I...

68
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,790
If it's for Nami-san's sake,
I don't care if you die!

69
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,610
I'm gonna knock you flat!

70
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,010
Alright, let's go! Hold on, Nami-san!

71
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,010
We're not done talking yet!

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,520
Nami-san!

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,710
Wait, Sanji! Hold on!

74
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,360
Please! Wait! Sanji-kun!

75
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,630
It seems they're serious
about rescuing you...

76
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,490
How utterly ridiculous...

77
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,570
Who could it be? No one
besides Luffy can still move...

78
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,560
And how did they get on board?!

79
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,830
Just because help has come
doesn't mean that you're saved,

80
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,350
or that I'm obligated to wait for them.

81
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,130
My only choice is to jump off
and hope for the best!

82
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,240
If I stay here, I'll die for sure!

83
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm up against lightning...
Is there anything I can do?!

84
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,500
What's this?

85
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,160
It's all run by machine...

86
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,940
Guess that means he doesn't
need underlings or henchmen...

87
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,750
He's one damn creep, that's for sure...

88
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,800
This ship's huge, but there's no one here!

89
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,960
Does it run on its own or something?!

90
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,370
And since when do ships fly, anyway?!
I never heard of that before!

91
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,920
Just the fact I'm on this kind of
ship makes me weak in the knees!

92
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,570
Talk about creepy!

93
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,550
How the heck does this thing work?!
Shouldn't it actually fall?!

94
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,610
Plus if Nami is on the deck, we're
already too high up to jump off!

95
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,090
What're we gonna do?!

96
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,980
The sky... It's getting darker and darker...

97
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,840
He intends to begin the
great destruction soon...

98
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,310
And then he'll probably take
the gold bell up above...

99
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,770
Into the boats! Don't get left behind!

100
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,160
Hurry to the White Sea!
We're running out of time!

101
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,610
What an ominous ship!

102
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,150
This land really is done for!

103
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,630
Escape from this village?! But, Chief!

104
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
What about the warriors?!
They're still not back from Upper Yard!

105
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,500
There is no need to wait for them.

106
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,150
You can't be serious!

107
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,120
Why do you say that?
The warriors are not children.

108
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,640
They will avoid their own dangers
on their own. Have faith in them.

109
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,180
Eneru probably will destroy this land.

110
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,690
No doubt he intends to repeat here

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,380
what he did to his homeland of Birka...

112
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,800
Now hurry and set sail!
Focus on keeping these people alive!

113
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,000
It's all over.

114
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,000
Wyper... It's all right now.
You've done everything you could.

115
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,170
Did you come from the Blue Sea?

116
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,190
We flew up here from below! Do you live here?

117
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,200
Everything is happening
right here in this very forest,

118
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,920
yet I can't tell what's happening inside...

119
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,570
It's hard, only being able to wait...

120
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,700
Please be all right, everyone!

121
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,030
Horsey-Bird! Horsey-Bird!

122
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,090
I'm so sorry! You hurt
yourself protecting me!

123
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,780
Aisa!

124
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,830
Aisa! Aisa!

125
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,190
Luffy? You're alive?!

126
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,190
Where are you?

127
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,160
Here! Over here, Aisa!

128
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,430
Aisa! Hey! Help me! Here! Over here!

129
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,580
What the heck kind of fall did you have?!

130
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,070
Alright... Dammit!
I can't get this gold ball off!

131
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,480
Don't call it that!

132
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,530
Anyways, let's go back to
the vine place Robin was at!

133
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,850
I'm not gonna let Eneru have his way!

134
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,560
Okay!

135
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,870
Don't think you can stop me this easily!

136
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,630
Let's go after the ship!
I know where it's headed!

137
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,190
You amuse me, girl.

138
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,660
It worked!

139
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,710
So such tools exist in the Blue Sea?

140
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,520
Thunder Ball!

141
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,460
Creating a path for the lightning... Clever!

142
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Only someone well acquainted with
weather phenomena could do that.

143
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,340
But... it's no use!

144
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,880
But surely you realize that it won't
help you if I change the scale!

145
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,030
Am I wrong?!

146
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,550
I'm busy. Begone!

147
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,120
I can't escape this time!

148
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,060
You begone!

149
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,110
Special Attack! Exploding Star!

150
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,970
I-I'm sorry!

151
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,220
Usopp!

152
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,180
So it was you, huh? I met you on the boat...

153
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,050
Huh?! Where's Sanji?!

154
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,100
Sanji-kun?! He's here?!

155
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,270
You mean he's not here yet?!

156
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,970
I see...

157
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,220
Bye.

158
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,100
Hey, you!

159
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,520
You're a man, Usopp!
What are you running for?!

160
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,780
So what if you're God?!

161
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,610
Usopp!

162
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,190
Nami!

163
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,130
What?! What should I do?!

164
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,170
Save me!

165
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,170
Screw that!

166
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,630
I thought you came here to save me!

167
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,110
No, actually, I'm not really
sure what's going on...

168
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,080
Then what are you doing here?!

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,940
I dunno...

170
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,350
What do you mean you don't know?!

171
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,260
Save me already!

172
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,360
What do you mean save?
We're dealing with God here!

173
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,580
Yeah, huh?

174
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,180
By the way, Nami! That hat!

175
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah, it's Luffy's! He was here
earlier, but he got thrown off!

176
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,380
He's not dead! Not him!

177
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,000
The ship's flying up!
We can't count on Luffy to help!

178
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,570
Yeah!

179
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,110
Let's get through this somehow!

180
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm not a fan of dying!

181
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,090
Roger that!

182
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,720
Hey! Stay by this discharge tube!
It's gotta be pretty important!

183
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,560
It should keep him from doing big attacks!

184
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,990
Usopp! Look!

185
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,060
A waver!

186
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,780
I think jumping off in
that is our only choice!

187
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,000
Jump off?! Are you crazy?! At this height--

188
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,330
No, there's an Island Cloud area
in the center of the forest!

189
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,950
We might survive if we can make it there!

190
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,970
Yeah?!

191
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,330
Dammit!

192
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,890
I'll distract God somehow! Get it ready!

193
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,770
Right!

194
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,180
Take this, God! Usopp Spell!

195
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,580
A needle got stuck deep under my fingernail!

196
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
Yikes! Just thinking about that really hurts!

197
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,780
You idiot! Cover your
ears! This could kill you!

198
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,010
I used paper to slice across my knuckles!

199
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,050
I have five canker sores on my gums!

200
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,430
Usopp!

201
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,900
I gotta get ready! We're only gonna
have a quick moment to escape!

202
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,520
Usopp!

203
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,100
Looks good! There are
Island Clouds by that vine!

204
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
Alright! All set--

205
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,700
Usopp!

206
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,190
Even if you want to escape,
it won't be so easy against me.

207
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:02,450
Or will you try to play a
deadly game of tag with God?

208
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,370
Usopp! Grab on!

209
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,830
Grab my hand!

210
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,220
There is no salvation for you at this point.

211
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,470
Usopp!

212
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,100
Go.

213
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,300
El...

214
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,420
Sanji-kun!

215
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,580
Hit it, Nami!

216
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,210
...Thor!

217
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,260
Wait, Usopp! Why'd you hit the gas?!
What about Sanji-kun?!

218
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,880
Never mind him! We gotta escape!

219
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,190
Are you trying to stomp
all over a man's resolve?!

220
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,470
So they jumped off...

221
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,290
Do they still not understand
the range of my attacks?

222
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,100
They haven't escaped me in the slightest...

223
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,030
Hey, God...

224
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,000
There's one thing I wanted to say...

225
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,510
No, but first...

226
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,430
Thanks...

227
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,680
I was just about to ask... for a light...

228
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,780
And? What else?

229
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,240
Yeah... You'll... pay for this...

230
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,410
W-What the...?! The ship!

231
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,690
You'll pay for this...

232
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
No, you didn't!

233
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:03,370
Damn you! What were you
doing inside the ship just now?!

234
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

235
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

236
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

237
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

238
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

239
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

240
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

241
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

242
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,750
What huge lightning! We're gonna
end up sky dust if we stay here!

243
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,010
Hurry to the ship! We gotta escape
before this land is wiped out!

244
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,630
Are the sky islands going to disappear?

245
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,470
Now then, let us begin the festivities!

246
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,020
There are no safe places left in Skypiea!

247
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,300
On the next episode of One Piece!

248
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,360
"Capriccio for Despair-- Looming
Destruction of the Sky Islands!!"

249
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,580
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
