00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,930
We're out! We're out!

22
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,460
Make chase at once!

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,540
O-One other thing, Lt. Commander!

24
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,150
While in pursuit of them,
Eric-sama also reappeared

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,230
and has just returned to ship!

26
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,950
Look at 'em come! Look at 'em come!

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,960
The Going Merry is faster and more agile,

28
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,460
but what are we going to do
when we get to Warship Island?!

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,670
--We'll be okay!
--How will we be okay?!

30
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,680
We just need to find
the dragons' nest first

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,140
so Grandpa Ryu can get better, right?!

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,590
Doesn't look like that's
going to be an option...

33
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,480
The small fries have leapt forth...

34
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,200
Open to the left and right!
Crane Wing Formation!

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,450
What now?! They have us blocked off!

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,690
Jump onto a ship, kick the guys off,
and cut the links!

37
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,070
That's the only choice, obviously!

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,580
Doesn't sound too bad to me!

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,330
Okay! Let's go!

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,620
Alright!

41
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,960
"Luffy, Completely Surrounded!
Commodore Nelson's Secret Strategy"

42
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,290
Marvelous! A truly marvelous view!

43
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,430
Listen, now! Do not let
the attacks falter even a bit!

44
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,310
Yes, sir!

45
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,950
But do not hit the raft!

46
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,420
Yes, Commodore!

47
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,100
For so many years I've sought
the Millennial Dragon...

48
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,860
And I've finally found it!

49
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,440
The elixir of immortality,
the Dragonite, is now as good as mine!

50
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,150
Sir! The commodore's flagship
says his plan has succeeded!

51
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,560
He says his attack is still ongoing!

52
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,700
Looks like our mission is over now.

53
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,760
If they fall into
Nelson Royal's hands now...

54
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,590
Hold on, Lt. Commander!

55
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,320
Do you still want something?

56
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,850
Prepare one paddleboat
and three proficient seamen.

57
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,600
A paddleboat?! What for?!

58
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,600
Because a mast would get in the way.

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
Don't tell me you're going
into the enclosed area?!

60
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,200
Just do it already.

61
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,630
Apis! It's dangerous! Go back inside!

62
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,360
I can't leave Grandpa Ryu all by himself!

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,710
Hey, you! Wait!

64
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,890
That's dangerous! Get back here!
It's your fault if you fall!

65
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,270
Grandpa Ryu!

66
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,950
Just hang in there a little longer!

67
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,770
I promise I'll take you
to the dragons' nest!

68
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,260
Man, she's brave!

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,660
Dammit! That moves me to tears!

70
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,170
Alright!

71
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,080
I'll break through the front lines
and take you to the dragons' nest!

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
Oww!

73
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,280
Hey! We've been hit from behind!

74
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,380
Hey! Sanji! We've been hit! Sanji!

75
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,990
We're done for! We're sunk!

76
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,860
Pipe down! We ain't been hit.

77
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,560
Eh? Seriously?

78
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeah.

79
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,390
I'm saved!

80
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,370
Who the hell thought
of this plan anyway?!

81
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,920
It was you.

82
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,100
That's it! That's it! Go!

83
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,670
Hey! A ball's coming this way!

84
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't do any more than this!
Do something on your end!

85
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,970
Okay! I'll do something!

86
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,590
Gum-Gum...

87
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,270
...Balloon!

88
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,690
No way...!

89
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,510
No way!

90
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,230
You impudent bastards!

91
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,310
How dare you damage one of my warships?!

92
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,530
What are you doing?!

93
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,080
Hit them with the Super Giant Cannon!

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,860
Yes, sir!

95
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,400
There's no escape!
There's no escape!

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,040
There's no escape for you!

97
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,840
Prepare to fire the Super Giant Cannon!

98
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,140
The pirate ship has
been trapped up ahead!

99
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,020
Ready to fire!

100
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,680
What is that?!

101
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,810
A direct hit from that and our
ship'll be blown to shreds!

102
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,840
We'll be okay!
I'll just bounce it back again!

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,290
Don't be stupid!
I'll turn the ship about;

104
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,550
you guys work the rear sail! Hurry!

105
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,530
Yeah!

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,870
An eye for an eye!
I got a shot ready for you, too!

107
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,200
Here we go!

108
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,330
Eat this!

109
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,720
Fire!

110
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,520
Fire!

111
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,390
What just happened?!

112
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,940
An enemy cannonball hit
our main cannon perfectly!

113
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,840
W-What?!

114
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,270
Hurry and lift me up!

115
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,910
Yes, sir!

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,430
Howdya like that?!

117
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,420
This is what happens when
Usopp-sama gets serious!

118
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,060
Not too shabby, for a fluke.

119
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,120
You're so full of it.

120
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,040
--What?! I can do that anytime!
--Wow... He hit it!

121
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,980
You're cool, Usopp!

122
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,840
Yeah!

123
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,970
It'll be okay! Don't worry!

124
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,140
You just keep Apis safe!

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,060
Who're you talking to?!

126
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,030
Grandpa Ryu.

127
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,110
Huh?

128
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,560
Now's our chance!

129
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,460
Let's act quickly and
cut some links to open a path!

130
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,650
Right, Nami-san!

131
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,820
Luffy.

132
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,530
Leave it to me!

133
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,580
Gum-Gum...

134
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,370
...Bridge!

135
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,090
Alright!

136
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,730
Grandpa Ryu!

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Just hold on!

138
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,310
Here goes!

139
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,430
Sorry, Zoro.

140
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930
Why, you...!

141
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,940
Report! What are they doing?!

142
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,680
Yes, sir!

143
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,690
Three people from the pirate ship
have boarded portside Ship #1!

144
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,400
Huh?! Say what?!

145
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,330
Steel chains, huh?

146
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,700
Think you can cut 'em?

147
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,520
There's nothing I can't cut!

148
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
Really? Then they're all yours.

149
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,570
Talk about coming out of the woodwork...

150
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,550
I like it when things are lively!

151
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,600
Sure, whatever.

152
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,140
I leave the small fries to you.

153
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,850
Yeah!

154
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,650
In the name of the Nelson Fleet,
we won't let you break through here!

155
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,090
Yeah! That's it! That's it!
You're so wonderful!

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,760
Keep it up!
Chop those things up good!

157
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,220
Curse you! How dare you
lousy pirates try to break my links?!

158
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,020
Capture them, at all costs!

159
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,640
Or else I'll maroon
every last one of you!

160
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,290
Gum-Gum...

161
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,070
...Gatling!

162
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,250
Here they come! Here they come!

163
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,270
Gum-Gum...

164
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,820
...Slingshot!

165
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,350
Hiyaaaaaah!

166
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,330
Wow...

167
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,860
I didn't know they were like this...

168
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,620
There's only one chain left!
Let's get moving!

169
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,930
Aye-aye, sir!

170
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,930
No, no! Someone stop them!

171
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh! Eric!

172
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,180
Well done! Now the
Millennial Dragon is mine!

173
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,190
That scared me--!

174
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,410
You're the Sicko Sicko Fruit guy!

175
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,110
Not "Sicko." The Sickle-Sickle Fruit!

176
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,330
Girl! It's time to hand
over the Millennial Dragon!

177
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,590
No! I'll never give you Grandpa Ryu!

178
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,590
Hand it over like a good little girl!

179
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,640
No!

180
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,670
I can chop you into pieces with
wind slashes at any time, you know.

181
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,640
Stop right there!

182
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,570
Lay a hand on the kid and you'll pay!

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
Y-Yeah! I, Usopp-sama,
won't sit by quietly either!

184
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,890
Fools.

185
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,950
I made that wind slash
just now miss on purpose...

186
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,700
Get in my way,
and this time I won't miss!

187
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,480
I'll blow your entire ship apart!

188
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,120
What's wrong?

189
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,820
It's him.

190
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,340
Huh? What's he doing?

191
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,180
--Tie the raft to our boat!
--Looks like he's planning to take
Apis hostage and steal the dragon.

192
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,680
--Yes, sir!
--Looks like he's planning to take
Apis hostage and steal the dragon.

193
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,300
That's bad!

194
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,720
Stop! If you lay a hand on him,

195
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,310
he'll take out Apis and Nami
and the others with his technique!

196
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,980
Oh! Right!

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,030
Then I'll use my foot!

198
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,400
--Huh?!
--Listen better!

199
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm taking the Millennial
Dragon now! Nothing personal!

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,760
You fight dirty! Give Apis back!

201
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,580
Eric! Well done! Now, bring it here!

202
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,710
No thanks. This isn't for you.

203
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,540
Eh?! What did you say?!

204
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,080
The only reason I obeyed you

205
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,980
was to use the Navy's
information-gathering capabilities.

206
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,990
What?!

207
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,380
It's not like you were any different.
You tried to use me, too.

208
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,650
I hired you for a great sum of money!

209
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,480
I think I've worked off
that chump change by now.

210
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,480
I have no obligation to obey
a sea lion like you anymore!

211
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,200
S-Sea lion?
You're calling me a sea lion?!

212
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,150
I'm going to use the Dragonite
I get from the Millennial Dragon

213
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,490
to make myself perfect!

214
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,790
You'll pay! You'll pay for this!

215
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,660
Shoot that backstabber!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

216
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,550
They're starting again!

217
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,480
If you don't want to
get blasted into pieces,

218
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,980
you'd better start rowing!

219
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,490
Stop...

220
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,210
Stop!

221
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,540
I'm begging you! Please don't
harass Grandpa Ryu any more!

222
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,740
He hasn't done anything wrong!

223
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,100
Be quiet.

224
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,060
I have to take him to
the dragons' nest right away!

225
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,500
So please stop this!

226
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,470
What're you doing?!
Let go! Let go, I said!

227
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,010
Listen, girl. You're a hostage.

228
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,720
And I'm taking the Millennial Dragon.

229
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,390
I'll never let you have
Grandpa Ryu! Never! Never!

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,110
I've had enough, girl!

231
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,030
Any more shouting
and I'll chop you apart!

232
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,610
Oww!

233
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,050
Let go!

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,080
Damn kid, giving me trouble...

235
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,300
Hey! What are you running for?!

236
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,120
Get back here!!

237
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,940
Dammit!

238
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,770
Grandpa Ryu!
You want some of this? It's yummy!

239
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,860
Hey, Grandpa Ryu!
Eat lots and get better soon, okay?!

240
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,570
That's so cute!
It really suits you, Grandpa Ryu!

241
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,080
I can't stand this!

242
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,270
Oww! My ears!

243
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,070
Grandpa Ryu let out a sound...!

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,810
Oww...

245
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,850
Grandpa Ryu!

246
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,660
You can move! That's great!

247
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,510
That's great!

248
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,440
What?

249
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,080
Really?!

250
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,590
What the...?!

251
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,180
You don't suppose he's...

252
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,900
Yeah! You can do it,
Grandpa Ryu! You can fly!

253
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,530
You're flying!
You're flying, Grandpa Ryu!

254
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,560
No! If the Millennial Dragon
is just going to escape,

255
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,120
then I don't care if we kill it!

256
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,490
All I need is its Dragonite, anyway!

257
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,520
Fire! Fire! Fire like mad!

258
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,150
Stop!

259
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,680
Grandpa Ryu! Run!

260
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,050
Run to where the
cannons can't reach you!

261
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,210
That's it! Shoot him down, quickly!

262
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,760
Stop that!

263
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,020
Now's your chance to run, Grandpa Ryu!

264
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,820
What are you doing?!
Attack it with this ship, too!

265
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,480
Yes, sir!

266
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,700
It must be shot down!

267
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,550
Grandpa Ryu!

268
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,800
No! Don't go that way!

269
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,390
What?! It's coming this way!
Shoot it down, quickly!

270
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,740
It's coming!
Shoot it, quickly! Shoot it!

271
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,320
Grandpa Ryu!

272
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,000
Grandpa Ryu! Hang in there!

273
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,220
Hey, now! What are you saying?!
Don't talk about dying!

274
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,300
Yeah. I know. I will save Apis!

275
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,330
And take you to the dragons' nest!

276
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,060
So try hard to stay alive!

277
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,030
Grandpa Ryu!

278
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,910
My overflowing feelings don't connect

279
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,750
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

280
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,670
I'll set off by myself,

281
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,630
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

282
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,400
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

283
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,490
Why is it so hot?

284
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,490
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

285
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

286
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,590
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

287
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,300
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

288
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,690
With you, I can run there

289
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,490
Hang in there, Grandpa Ryu!

290
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,520
What happened to going to
Lost Island?! Try hard to stay alive!

291
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,010
Damn those Navy guys!

292
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,550
This isn't good.

293
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,250
Luffy can't swim, right?

294
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,920
Hold on! What is this?!
The whole sea is shaking!

295
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,650
What in the world's happening?!

296
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,870
H-H-Hey, now! What's that?!
It's coming this way!

297
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,460
On the next episode of One Piece!

298
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,600
"Through the Sky They Soar!
The 1,000-Year Legend Lives Again!"

299
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,710
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
