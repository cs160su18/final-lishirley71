2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,390
The sky is unexpectedly clear tonight.

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,670
M-Moria! It's Moria!

49
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,480
Where?! Where is he?!

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,280
The sun will be rising soon.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Should you really be farting around?

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,910
Why is he here?

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,120
Huh? I can hear Master's voice!

54
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,080
Usopp!

55
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,830
Huh? What?!

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,470
Crap!

57
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,770
Usopp!

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,390
Usopp!

59
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,560
Shit! Oars is acting intelligently
now that Moria is with him!

60
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,070
Usopp!

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,360
Where are you?! Answer me!

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,740
He's okay!

63
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,620
I thought that you might need salt,
so I gathered it in bulk!

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,730
Brook!

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,870
You're a lifesaver!

66
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,730
"The Secret Plan to Turn the Tables!
Nightmare Luffy Makes His Appearance!"

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,680
Brook, you can move?

68
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,640
You seem to be doing really great.

69
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,390
I owe ya one. Thank you!

70
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,230
Indeed, I was severely injured!

71
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,110
I dragged my battered body
to the kitchen in search of salt.

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,880
Upon stumbling across some milk, I happily

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,340
drank away and look what happened!

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,730
Wait, just how regenerative is calcium?!

75
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,040
Doesn't milk help mend broken bones?

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,830
Don't lie!

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,320
Whatever the case may be,

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,550
we got a massive
amount of salt just in the nick of time.

79
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,330
The path to the kitchen has been cut off.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,720
Brook's salt is our last hope.

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,640
We're running out of time. We must fight!

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,640
If we can stuff the salt
down that monster's throat

83
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,060
and kick Moria's butt before dawn, we win!

84
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,870
I'm freaking scared!

85
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm horribly scared as well.

86
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,450
I still can't believe he has a cockpit.

87
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,250
I thought that freak had a normal body.

88
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,760
You should be grateful that
I have decided to join the fray!

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,640
And I'd be extremely careful if I were you.

90
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm not simply a passenger here!

91
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,980
I will show you the ultimate nightmare!

92
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,240
I shall fight in this battle as well!
I will give it my all!

93
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,240
I could never begin to repay the debt

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,090
I owe you guys for recovering my shadow,

95
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,340
but I'll fight to the fullest!

96
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,830
--I'm stiff!
--Don't push yourself!

97
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,090
Stay on top of the salt!

98
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,550
--Let's go, Chopper!
--Yeah!

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,090
I'll give you a taste of
my anti-monster shells!

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,220
Victory goes to those
who take the initiative!

101
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,640
Apparently it wasn't big enough last time!

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,140
Franky, I'm counting on you!

103
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,640
Special Attack! Special Oil Star!

104
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,940
Okay! Now we're talking!

105
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,990
Transform!

106
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,620
Super Size!

107
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,530
Fire Bird Star!

108
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,450
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,970
Hot! Hot, hot, hot!

110
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,330
Hot! Hot, hot!

111
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,960
Sweet! Serves you right!

112
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, now get that one contraption ready.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
Huh? Oh, okay.

114
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,340
Hot! Hot, hot! Hot!

115
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,680
Pathetic! Don't shrink back, Oars!

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,620
You only think things "hurt"
or "feel hot" because

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,300
of the time you spent as a human.

118
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,520
Things of this nature do not work
on you now that you are a zombie.

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,650
Calm down and put out the fire!

120
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,230
Now that you mention it,
this doesn't feel the least bit hot.

121
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,330
Now, Zoro!

122
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,320
Okay!

123
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,880
Oomph!

124
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,400
Three-Sword Style...

125
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,910
...Great Buddha Slayer!

126
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Eat this! Jenga Cannon!

127
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,330
Have seconds! Thirds!
Fourths! Fifths! And sixths!

128
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,440
Stinking jerk!

129
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,610
The tower is flying straight at us!

130
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,170
Oh, no!

131
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,600
Huh?

132
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,440
Veinte Fleurs!

133
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,360
Oh, thanks!

134
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Stop it, you idiots!

135
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,580
Oops! He used them against us!

136
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,290
Hey, you guys okay?

137
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,750
H-Here's my new weapon, Kuwagata!

138
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, and whoosh!

139
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,320
Hah! Super!

140
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Uh, drop the super pose...
Holding this back is killing me.

141
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,660
So are you all set, Usopp?

142
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Y-Yeah, but I only made this to look cool!

143
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,620
I have no idea how it will actually work!

144
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,170
Don't worry about it!
I'm extra super this week.

145
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,800
Then get on!

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,050
All right! Aim for the
center of that lug's gut!

147
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,430
Go! Special Attack! Iron Man Comet!

148
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,480
This is going super!

149
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,270
Say your prayers!

150
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,350
I use this trench mortar
against sea monsters and Sea Kings!

151
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,650
I'm gonna fill ya full of holes!

152
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,970
Eat this, Moria!

153
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,450
He's so agile!

154
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,410
Sometimes I forget that he's Luffy!

155
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,410
Tch!

156
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,210
Franky!

157
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,790
Franky!

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,450
You're not done yet, Oars.
He's still hanging on by a thread.

159
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,040
Finish him off!

160
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,250
Okay!

161
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,430
Shoot! Isn't he going to stop there?!

162
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,060
Stop it! He can't move anymore!

163
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,060
Franky!

164
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,940
Thunderbolt...

165
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,570
Huh? That cloud...!

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,280
...Tempo!

167
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,120
Damn it! Who did that?!

168
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,960
What did they do?!

169
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,800
It worked! Oars fell to his knees!

170
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,930
Lightning! That attack
could only come from...!

171
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,430
Clima Takt! Nami-san, are you all right?

172
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,480
He just sparked!

173
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,020
Lightning? Out of nowhere?

174
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,360
Oars summoned lightning! I'm sure of it!

175
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,820
There you are!

176
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,860
It's Nami-san!

177
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,080
Nami-san! Nami-san! Nami-san! Nami-san!

178
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,460
Nami-san!

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,540
Hey! Quit yelling my name!

180
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,790
What if he notices me?!

181
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,170
Thank goodness! What a relief!

182
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,260
I'm so glad Nami-san is okay!

183
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,520
Thank God! Please forgive me for failing you!

184
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
--Nami-san, I'm sorry!
--What a loudmouth.

185
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,440
--Woman!
--See?

186
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,360
How dare you take us so lightly?!

187
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,910
Oars, show them your true power!

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,370
Gum-Gum...

189
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,950
Wh-What? What? What?! Can he stretch?

190
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,710
He can't reach her from there, can he?

191
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,630
Now's our chance! Get Franky somewhere safe!

192
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,450
'Kay!

193
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,050
...Pistol!

194
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,810
What?!

195
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,650
H-His arm extended?! Why?!

196
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,830
It stretched. That feels
more like how it should.

197
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,170
But that's impossible!

198
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,560
--Nami!
--Nami-san!

199
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,930
No!

200
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,040
I see her! Nami is okay!

201
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,850
Phew! Robin saved her.

202
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,440
I wasn't expecting that.
Are you all right, Nami?

203
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,570
Thank you. I'm okay, thanks to you.

204
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,990
Something seriously bad just happened!

205
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,550
Why was he able to stretch his arm?

206
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,330
There is only one rubber man in the world!

207
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,750
It's Moria! He must have done something.

208
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,960
The bastard!

209
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,170
Gum-Gum...

210
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,140
...Whip!

211
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,600
It's like we're fighting a
monster version of Luffy!

212
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,770
What is keeping Luffy?!

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,920
I need to hurry back!

214
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,130
I'm awful! I intentionally held
my leg out to trip you! Teehee!

215
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,640
What's your problem?! I'm in a hurry!

216
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,930
What do you want?!

217
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah, we know! We totally
get that you're in a hurry.

218
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,440
Please give us a minute!
You're our only hope!

219
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,610
--We've been searching for you this whole time.
--Huh?

220
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,570
We're the Risky Brothers,
members of the Rolling Pirates led by

221
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,340
Captain "Marriage Proposal" Lola.

222
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,820
Don't you want to defeat that Gecko Moria

223
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,570
guy who lives in the mansion? Well?

224
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,790
So? What's your deal?

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,750
We know the secret behind Moria's powers.

226
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,760
We'll give incredible power to you,
so please! Take him down!

227
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,260
Secret? Power?

228
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,240
C'mon!

229
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,680
Like I said, what's your deal?!

230
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,460
Allow me to introduce the Rolling
Pirates' captain, Marriage Proposal Lola.

231
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,150
She has currently proposed 4,443 times!

232
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,610
My! I like you. Please marry me.

233
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,440
No.

234
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,070
Rejected! That was her 4,444th rejection!

235
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,960
So everyone here has lost their shadow

236
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,000
and joined the Victim Association
that wanders these forests.

237
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,080
I'm in a hurry, since my
shadow was also taken!

238
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,640
Aren't you Straw Hat Luffy?

239
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,260
Bluntly put, today is the first day
Thriller Bark has rocked and shaken like this!

240
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,360
The Three Phantoms who serve Moria
have been defeated one after the next.

241
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,520
The mansion is already halfway demolished!

242
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,730
Yeah! You've filled us with non-stop
excitement ever since you arrived.

243
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,980
But your enemy is no pushover!
He has already awoken the Special Zombie!

244
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,750
Don't look so surprised!

245
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,200
We use the Victim Network to stay
up-to-date on the situation!

246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,120
We've gone three whole
years without our shadows!

247
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,830
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life like this!

248
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,000
If you defeat Moria,
everyone will get their shadows back!

249
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,460
That's what we thought, but jeez!

250
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,750
Do you even know where Moria is right now?

251
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,130
In its belly! The belly of that monster!

252
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,670
What?! Did he get eaten?!

253
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,330
No! He climbed inside
of the monster's stomach.

254
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,430
In other words, you can't touch Moria

255
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,390
if you don't defeat the Special
Zombie that has your shadow!

256
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,770
Your friends are fighting the zombie
in the mansion courtyard right now!

257
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,600
They're what?! Damn it!

258
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,810
I don't have time for this!

259
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,270
We need you to hold your horses!

260
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,200
Ow!

261
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,290
Jeez! We'll skip the circular explanations!

262
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,030
It'll be faster if he sees it for himself!

263
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,850
Show him the secret behind
the shadows that we discovered!

264
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,370
Okay! Move, move! Coming through!

265
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,540
Huh? A shadow?

266
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,380
Right, it's a shadow.

267
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,930
When we feed salt to a zombie,

268
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,840
we can catch the shadow that comes out!

269
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,770
Ready, go!

270
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,220
Wh-What are you doing?!

271
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,010
--The shadow is stabbing me!
--Sit still!

272
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,140
Knock it off! I'm feeling lightheaded!

273
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,160
Great! It went in.

274
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,840
Well? Are you still yourself?

275
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah...

276
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,930
Can you use a sword?

277
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Nope, not at all.

278
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,100
Give him a sword!

279
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,930
Here!

280
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,450
Geh! What's going on?!

281
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,160
The shadow we just put inside of you
belonged to a skilled Navy swordsman.

282
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,290
A Navy swordsman?

283
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,170
All of the shadow's combat abilities
will be added to your own.

284
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,010
And we can put in as many shadows
as you can mentally handle!

285
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,040
Well? Isn't it amazing?

286
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,100
We can use Moria's powers to
boost your strength several fold!

287
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,350
We still have a bunch
of shadows we've caught!

288
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,740
But if you have weak
willpower, you'll pass out.

289
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,070
All of our hard work will go up in smoke!

290
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,700
Why do you have so many shadows?

291
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,470
We desperately went around purifying
zombies in search of our own shadows.

292
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,870
Wouldn't it tick you off if you released
some random stranger's shadow?

293
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,460
So that's how we began our shadow collection.

294
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,250
Listen, you need to remember this!

295
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,380
When a shadow enters a corpse,
it turns into a zombie.

296
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,260
But it won't stick around if there
is already a soul in the body.

297
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,440
Your power-up will only
last ten minutes at most.

298
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,670
After that, the shadow will pop out
and return to its true master.

299
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,120
Got that? You must finish
the fight in ten minutes.

300
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,940
We will give you all of the shadows
that we risked our lives to obtain!

301
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,650
Geh! That many?!

302
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,220
Now that the fog has cleared up,

303
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,150
we only have twenty minutes of
night left to get our work done!

304
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,640
You must hurry!

305
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,660
Don't forget who you are!

306
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,370
I am sure you can handle
twenty or thirty shadows!

307
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Although we could only handle two or three.

308
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,710
Huh?

309
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,460
--Do it!
--Okay!

310
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,340
Whoa! W-W-Wait!
I didn't say I'd go along with...!

311
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,080
J-Just how strong... is this man's willpower?

312
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,310
He's amazing! I've never
heard of anything like this!

313
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,030
W-We put in all 100 shadows!

314
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,530
Incredible! Just what I'd expect
from our Star of Hope!

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,090
H-Hey, did you lose your mind?
Are you still you, Straw Hat Luffy?

316
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,510
Yeah, I'm me.

317
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,890
Power is surging through me. I can't stop it!

318
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,100
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!...

319
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,280
Take this, Straw Hat!

320
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,560
You know, man... It's like you're
a completely different person now.

321
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,500
Weren't you a little bit shorter before?

322
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,250
I wonder how strong he has become.

323
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,470
I am itching... for a fight!

324
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,730
He'll do just great!

325
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,940
Go on! There isn't much time!

326
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,900
Go give Moria a nightmare,
our Star of Hope, Nightmare Luffy!

327
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,800
Just you wait, Moria!

328
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait! The mansion isn't that way!

329
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,720
No way! Why does Oars'
body stretch and contract?

330
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,190
You're mistaken. Oars' body isn't stretching.

331
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,820
Huh? What do you mean?

332
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,220
It looks like Oars' body is changing to
match the movements of his shadow.

333
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,480
In that case, this is another
one of Moria's powers.

334
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

335
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,110
"The Straw Hat Crew Gets Wiped Out!
The Shadow-Shadow's Powers in Full Swing!"

336
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
