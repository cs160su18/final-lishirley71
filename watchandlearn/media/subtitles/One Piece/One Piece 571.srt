00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,390
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,310
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,360
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,660
where they instigated an all-out war
against the New Fish-Man Pirates,

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,870
who were holding a grudge against humans
and looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom.

79
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:53,290
Luffy finally defeated Hordy, the captain of
the New Fish-Man Pirates, in a fierce fight

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,050
and thwarted his plot.

81
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,520
Listen. You all need to know
the two biggest changes...

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,260
...which have occurred in the New World.

83
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,240
First, the Navy Headquarters
led by Sakazuki...

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,760
...has become an even more
powerful force for justice.

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,940
And second,

86
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,990
the Blackbeard Pirates have advanced.

87
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,260
You fools! Why did you kick him out?!

88
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,370
Why didn't you just punch
him and tie him up here!

89
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,830
I love it even when you...

90
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,920
Go find him now!

91
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,550
They were sent by Big Mam.
This is not a good time!

92
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,410
We don't have any sweets
to pay them for this month.

93
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,400
Hordy and the others destroyed the factory

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,030
and the undamaged sweets have

95
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,940
been sent to the banquet
since everybody wanted the

96
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,510
Straw Hats to have them!

97
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,980
I wonder if we can explain the situation.

98
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,530
She is like a monster who would
destroy a whole country for sweets!

99
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,740
One of the Four Emperors...

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,510
Big Mam!

101
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:25,720
"She Loves Sweets! Big Mam
of the Four Emperors!"

102
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,570
After the banquet reaches its
climax, it comes to an end.

103
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,140
What?! They'll give us their treasure?!

104
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,800
Wow!

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,910
That's really nice!

106
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,790
I wonder if Luffy-sama and the others
are doing okay, Nami-chin-sama.

107
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,150
They're fine!

108
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,880
We're finally gonna become
a rich pirate group!

109
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,530
Things in life usually aren't that easy...

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,300
Hey Usopp, do you wanna go look for him too?

111
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
No, we better not. I did some research

112
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,010
and found out that his

113
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,210
THE FISH-MAN ISLAND - THE OUTSKIRTS
OF CORAL HILL NEAR THE CANDY FACTORY

114
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,050
bounty is over 200 million.

115
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,210
What?! Mine's only 50 berries...

116
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey look, Zoro, Sanji!
There he is! That was easy!

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,040
He got knocked out cold already
by your punch. How pathetic!

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,930
There is so much treasure
scattered around here.

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,770
Is that furry king really
going to give us all of this?

120
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,170
Cool! We can buy lots of meat!

121
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:30,160
I can't believe he was storing
all of this in his gloopy body!

122
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,290
1, 2, 3!

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,260
--Alright! Let's go back to the palace!
--How?

124
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,130
We need a flying fish.

125
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,330
--Which way is the town, Zoro?
--That way.

126
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,970
--Okay, let's head in the opposite direction.
--Hey!

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,710
All right, Minister of the Left?

128
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,620
Please show us mercy!

129
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,430
It was all unexpected! Hordy and the
others destroyed the factory and...

130
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,570
That's none of our concern! Grr!

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,110
I was planning on snatching some
for myself so I'm very hungry!

132
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,240
You pay us with sweets once a month.

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,320
And we allow you to use Mama's name.

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,960
PEKOMS-- A MEMBER OF THE BIG MAM PIRATES

135
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,960
That was the agreement, wasn't it? Grr!

136
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,300
Now, I don't want to say this to you
seeing as how we're business partners

137
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,360
but you know how scary Mama can be!
If you make her mad, she will...

138
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,180
...destroy you all!

139
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,700
He's cute when he does that!

140
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,690
Now, what are you gonna do?! Grr!

141
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,440
Look - a crowd.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,960
Oh, this is the Candy Factory!
Pappagu told me about it!

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,780
Yeah?

144
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,550
I hope we can find a flying fish here.

145
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,940
I guess they're making
those yummy sweets here!

146
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,250
Hey, Candy Factory!

147
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,920
Straw Hat Luffy!

148
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Luffy-san, is the banquet over already?!

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,130
Luffy-kun, why are you here?!

150
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,250
Yeah, I ate a lot!

151
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,210
The meat was good but those sweets

152
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,140
from the Fish-Man Island were unbelievable!

153
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,920
What?!

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,380
No, Straw Hat-san!

155
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,730
Don't talk about them!

156
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,580
Oh, old Mr. Catfish, it's you!

157
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,290
Did he say "sweets"?! Who are they?!

158
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,620
Oh yeah, he's Straw Hat Luffy! Definitely!

159
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,180
What is that notorious pirate doing here?

160
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,780
Well, um...

161
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,790
Hey brat! Which sweets
are you talking about?!

162
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,880
Well, Mr. Pekoms, let me explain...

163
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,630
Who are you?!

164
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,090
You're not a Fish-Man, are you?

165
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,780
You came to buy sweets?

166
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,060
I just finished stuffing myself full of them!

167
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,830
What?!

168
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,520
What's going on here?!
He just said he ate them!

169
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,610
W-Well... There is an explanation...

170
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh?! A talking lion!

171
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,660
But I guess that's not such a big
deal. We've got something similar.

172
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,030
Atchoo!

173
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,680
Whoa, what's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,780
Maybe somebody's talking about me.

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,040
You're popular.

176
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,330
This lion's got an unique face!

177
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,720
What?! Are you messing with me?!

178
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,930
Yuck! You fool!

179
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,100
Pekoms.

180
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,210
Making such threatening faces doesn't
help us in collecting the sweets.

181
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,330
Let's settle this peacefully-soir.
The tea party is 4 days from now-bon.

182
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,790
We can make it on time if we
leave here tomorrow morning-jour.

183
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,040
There's another odd one! Who are you?

184
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,380
Bon to meet you, you half-boiled pirates.

185
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,890
My name is Baron Tamago-soir!

186
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,890
BARON TAMAGO-- A MEMBER OF THE
BIG MAM PIRATES (LONGFEET TRIBE)

187
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,390
Tamago (egg)?!

188
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,440
Remember my name at least-s'il vous plait!

189
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,940
Now, you gentlemen...

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,830
Did you just say you ate the sweets
from this factory-c'est si bon?

191
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,910
He looks like a compass.

192
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,460
Yes, I did! I wanna have
some more if they have any!

193
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,940
They don't. That's why we
don't know what to do-bon!

194
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,060
That big mark on the factory is...

195
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,680
...the Jolly Roger of the great pirate
and our boss- Charlotte Lingling-soir.

196
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,350
It claims this island as Big Mam's territory
- she is one of the Four Emperors.

197
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,730
Which means, the Fish-Man Island is
protected under Big Mam's name-bon!

198
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,700
Sounds like a nice person! I wanna
meet your boss! Big Mam, huh?

199
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,530
Don't mistake our arrangement.
We have a business arrangement.

200
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,810
In exchange for 10 tons of sweets a month,

201
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,750
we allow them to use the mark-bon.

202
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,660
--10 tons?
--That's right.

203
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,800
Mama loves sweet candies
more than anything-soir.

204
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,850
Sweets from the Fish-Man
Island are her favorite.

205
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,980
So we'll wait until tomorrow morning.

206
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,940
No, Baron, I already told you.

207
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,790
The factory's giant cooking
machines are broken

208
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,430
and we need at least 2 weeks to repair them!

209
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,650
That's not acceptable-soir.

210
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,450
Hey Tamago! Why can't you wait?!

211
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,580
Is your boss's mind as small as his balls?
He's one of the Four Emperors, isn't he?

212
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,120
It's not "he." Mama is a great
woman pirate-vous plait.

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't think she has balls-jour.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,230
Oh, she's a madam.

215
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,950
I love sweets!

216
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,170
And I love you too since you can make them!

217
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,350
What's gonna happen if you
can't have them on time?

218
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,980
In that case...

219
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,490
The deal is off!

220
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,590
Vicious members of the
Big Mam Pirates will...

221
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,950
...descend on the island and
destroy it  in no time-vous plait!

222
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,120
Destroy the island?!

223
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,190
Are you guys nuts? You can't
destroy a country over candies!

224
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,800
This island has just been saved!

225
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,370
WHOLE CAKE ISLAND SOMEWHERE IN THE NEW WORLD

226
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,370
You look happy, Mama.

227
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,710
ONE OF THE FOUR EMPERORS-- - THE GREAT
PIRATE "BIG MAM" CHARLOTTE LINGLING

228
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,540
I can't wait for the tea party

229
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,640
four days from now because...

230
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,570
...I'll get my hands on those delicious
sweets from the Fish-Man Island!

231
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,380
I can't wait and my stomach is
already producing so much acid!

232
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,700
Can't wait! Can't wait! The
sweets from the Fish-Man Island!

233
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,340
You guys can't wait either?

234
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,900
Of course, we can't! They are so good!

235
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,140
Then why don't you wait for
them inside of my stomach?!

236
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,060
Mama!

237
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,190
I'm home! Boyoyon!

238
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,040
Oh! How did it go, Bobbin?

239
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,060
I beat them up and burned the place!

240
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,110
How lovely!

241
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,700
That country had the best baked goods!

242
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,620
It must have smelled so good
as it burned to the ground!

243
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,410
It's a shame but we had no choice.

244
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,490
Because they couldn't reach
their quotas on time.

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,090
Can I have some snacks?

246
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,410
We have to kill them if
they don't give us sweets!

247
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,420
I don't like people who
don't keep their promises!

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,290
Just like I don't like bitter candies!

249
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh yeah! I heard the Fish-Man Island
may not have sweets to pay this month.

250
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,950
I just got word from Pekoms. Do
you want the Fish-Man Island

251
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,490
to be burned down too?

252
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,110
I can't have the sweets
from the Fish-Man Island?!

253
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,230
Get them on the Transponder Snail now!

254
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,560
Destroy the island?!

255
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,500
Are you guys nuts?

256
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,360
You can't destroy a country over candies!

257
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,990
This island has just been saved!

258
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,920
I can't believe it-bon.

259
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,280
They aren't even half-boiled, they are raw.

260
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,240
What should I do with those
fearless rookies-jour?

261
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,120
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

262
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,710
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

263
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,950
Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...

264
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,210
It must be Mama! Grr! I told them
what was going on a while ago.

265
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,510
B-Big Mam is calling in person?!

266
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,750
Hey, Pekoms!

267
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,460
Why don't you pick it up? Grr!
I don't wanna get yelled at!

268
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,340
Clank!

269
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,180
--Hello?
--Hey!

270
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,300
Are you Big Mam?!

271
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

272
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,950
You're not Tamago, are you? Nor Pekoms.

273
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,080
Who are you?

274
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,980
I'm Monkey D. Luffy! I'm gonna
become the King of the Pirates!

275
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,620
No, no, no, no, no, no!

276
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,340
--Luffy-kun!
--Straw Hat-san...

277
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,550
Monkey D.?

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,890
You're Garp's grandson!

279
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,170
Now I remember!

280
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,760
You were the brat who meddled
in the war 2 years ago.

281
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,700
The sweets are gone!

282
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,240
I ate them all!

283
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,170
So it's true that they don't have any!

284
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,200
They must have 10 tons of them!

285
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,370
I ate 10 tons of them!

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,590
Straw Hat-san, that's too...!

287
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,220
Why is he saying that?

288
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,040
You fool! Stop lying!

289
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,470
You're covering up for Fish-Men, aren't you?

290
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,710
But it's true that I ate them!

291
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,970
I didn't know they had to go to you!

292
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,430
We have a lot of treasure with us here.

293
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,150
You can have it all! In
compensation for the sweets!

294
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,860
Treasure?!

295
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,630
I can't eat treasure!

296
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,400
What I want is sweet candies!

297
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,920
Hey, wait a minute! Is that all treasure?

298
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,780
Yes, it is.

299
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,040
Mama, this is Tamago! Let's think about this.

300
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,890
A few days ago, that brat - Captain
Kid sank two of our allies' ships-bon!

301
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,470
Kid?

302
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,630
It's that guy!

303
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,450
The rookie who's worth over a 100
million that we met at the Sabaody!

304
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
It was a huge loss

305
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,480
and to be honest, we've been
in need of money lately-bon.

306
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,010
So how about we save the fun of
eating sweets for a couple of weeks

307
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:12,660
and take the treasure and forgive them?
I think it's the best plan for us-jour.

308
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,510
If you want candies,

309
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,700
we could get something sweet
and delicious on our way back.

310
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,970
Screw that, Tamago!

311
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,300
How could you say such
an embarrassing thing!?

312
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,060
Pirates shouldn't compromise
on what they want!

313
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
I-I'm sorry-soir!

314
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,720
Having said that,

315
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,860
That brat who stood up to
me has piqued my interest.

316
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,790
Have it your way, instead
of the Fish-Man Island,

317
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,830
I'll have my vengeance against you all!

318
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,890
Luffy-sama and the others are not back yet.

319
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,600
Are you sure they are going
to be okay, Nami-chin-sama?

320
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah, it's taking so long.

321
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,830
Boy! I wonder what they're doing!

322
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,610
I won't forgive them if they
can't get the treasure back!

323
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,980
Monkey D. Luffy. I know your name now.

324
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,870
Come to the New World!

325
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,920
Luffy-kun!

326
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,790
Sure, wait for me there.

327
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,010
There's some business I want
to settle with you, too.

328
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,610
I can't leave it in your
hands - that's too dangerous!

329
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,650
I'll kick your ass all over the New World...

330
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,200
...and make the Fish-Man Island my territory!

331
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,560
You insolent brat!

332
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,630
Fish-Man Island's treasure,

333
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,390
the Tamate Box, hold a surprising secret.

334
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,920
One that further intensifies the conflict...

335
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,400
...between Luffy and Big
Mam of the Four Emperors.

336
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,570
Uncertainty grows concerning the
Straw Hats' next destination.

337
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,290
On the oceans of the New World...

338
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,040
...than man whose fate is
closely tied to theirs...

339
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,390
...makes a move.

340
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,900
On the next episode of One Piece!

341
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,730
"Many Problems Lie Ahead! A Trap
Awaiting in the New World!"

342
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
