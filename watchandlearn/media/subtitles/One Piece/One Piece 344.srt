2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,930
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,770
I saw what you just did!
You're terribly strong, aren't you?

48
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,020
There is a man I would like you to defeat.

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,990
If I get my shadow back,
I'll do anything I can to thank you!

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,200
Your shadow?

51
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,990
So what? Are you another
person who lost his shadow?

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,040
You're just like Brook.

53
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,360
So who the heck stole it?

54
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,620
Who is on this island?

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,790
The man's name is Moria.
He is truly terrifying.

56
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,030
Moria?

57
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,130
By any chance...

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Are you referring to Gecko Moria?

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeah, that's him. That's the Moria I meant.

60
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,720
Robin, do you know him?

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,440
Gecko Moria is one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

62
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,160
"Evil Be Gone"

63
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,910
Infidels!

64
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,330
He found us!

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,210
I made it perfectly clear to
keep your noses out of my lab!

66
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,170
I-I-I didn't see a thing!

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,550
N-Neither did I!

68
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,550
Uh-huh! I didn't see anything either.

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,550
Honest?

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,220
C-Cross my heart! I swear I didn't
see a zombie in the works!

71
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,850
Don't say that!

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,650
Well, it's all good.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,070
It doesn't matter what secrets
you uncover. It's too late anyway.

74
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,870
We round up the unsuspecting guests
who wander onto this island.

75
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,030
Then the night raid begins!

76
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,180
Now then, my Soldier Zombie Corps!

77
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,960
The General Zombies will
take those pirates down!

78
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,970
Are you ready, zombies?

79
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,430
Yeah!

80
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:36,000
This is the land of the
deceased, Thriller Bark!

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,650
May you have unpleasant nightmares!

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,330
Well, shall we go?

83
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,200
It's a haunted mansion!

84
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,040
"Feast of the Zombie Song! The Night
Raid's Bell is the Sound of Darkness!"

85
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,180
What was that crap about
zombie research, Hogback?!

86
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,590
Instead of investigating them,

87
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,760
you're the one calling the
dead back from the grave!

88
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,340
H-Hey, Nami! Don't blurt that out!

89
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,600
You're free to suspect anything you like now,

90
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
but what makes you think that?

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,020
I found a newspaper article
about that woman's death!

92
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,530
Victoria Cindry, you died
a good ten years ago!

93
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,120
Fiends! Did you go inside that room?!

94
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,660
Answer me!

95
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,400
Not only did you check out my lab,
but also that room...

96
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,630
Cindry-chan! Samurai Ryuma!

97
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,420
Send them to the World of Shadows forthwith!

98
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,430
"Evil Be Gone"

99
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,430
W-Wait a second!

100
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,850
Send them to the World of Shadows,
never to bask in the light again!

101
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,140
The night raid has already begun.

102
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,190
"Evil Be Gone"

103
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,530
Did you see...

104
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,740
...all you care to of the laboratory?

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,670
"Dragon"

106
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,930
My, my...

107
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,690
Upon closer inspection,
I see that you are a truly elegant lady.

108
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,220
You're beautiful!

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,060
Huh?! N-No, hardly!

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,810
My eyes follow the beautiful ladies.

111
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,810
But I'm a mummy, so I don't have eyes!

112
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,570
May I see your panties?

113
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,740
No way!

114
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,010
This exchange...!

115
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,950
My eyes follow the beautiful ladies.

116
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,890
But I'm a skeleton, so I don't have eyes!

117
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,750
May I see your panties?

118
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,590
No way!

119
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,500
He repeated him word for word...

120
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,730
He's on a completely different level
from the other zombies you've seen!

121
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,980
With his special body,
he is a General Zombie.

122
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,860
This man hails from Wano
Kingdom in the New World!

123
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,110
No one knows if it's true or not,
but it's said this legendary samurai

124
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,190
cut down a dragon soaring through the sky!

125
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,330
Crap! Crap!!

126
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,790
Stay back!

127
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,340
There is nowhere to run!

128
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,160
Cindry-san, would you be so kind
as to open yonder passage?

129
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,660
Also, I would like a midnight snack.

130
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,120
Wh-What gives? I thought
he was going to attack us.

131
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,000
That scared me. What's he up to?

132
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,880
I-It doesn't matter!
C'mon, let's make a break for it!

133
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,960
The door is wide open!

134
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,010
--You're right!
--Y-Yeah!

135
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,420
Hurry!

136
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,100
Splendid!

137
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,940
When a person has been slashed by a master,

138
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,480
the master can casually walk three paces

139
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,590
while humming before the person notices.

140
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,330
Three-Pace Hum... Notch Slash!

141
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,200
Excuse me! I'm coming in!

142
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,160
Give 'em more time!

143
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,940
Huh? The door's locked.

144
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,890
Ah! It opened right up!

145
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,490
You call that "opening right up"?

146
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,930
Gecko Moria! Come on out already!

147
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,350
What do you think they use this room for?

148
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,320
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

149
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,150
Hey! Anyone around?

150
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,900
Gecko Moria!

151
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,240
This is such a huge mansion...
Shouldn't there be at least one servant?

152
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,530
Why does it look like there
was a skirmish in here?

153
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,540
I hope nothing happened to Nami-san...

154
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,300
You've got some guts, coming when
you know our master's name!

155
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,260
Huh? A piggy is growing out of the wall?

156
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,140
There's still more in store for you!

157
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,100
Show our guests a warm welcome!

158
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,410
Oh, jeez! Are these supposed to be zombies?

159
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,870
I think you can find just about any
creature imaginable on this island.

160
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,260
Where the hell...

161
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,260
...did you hide Nami-san?!

162
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,640
It's improper for a lady to
open her mouth gaping wide.

163
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,060
And here you're so pretty.

164
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,680
Huh? Really?

165
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,520
But not when you leave the painting.

166
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,990
Twist!

167
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,360
Now for you.

168
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,450
You snapped my spearhead!
What are you made out of? Iron?!

169
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,910
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
What the heck are you guys?!

170
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,410
Weren't those weaklings
supposed to be your crewmates?

171
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes!

172
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,130
Two-Sword Style... Nigiri!

173
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,090
Nigiri? Like sushi? Sounds yummy!

174
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,590
Flash!

175
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,430
It was nasty!

176
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,100
This island really is fun!

177
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,020
Darn it! You're one fast bastard!

178
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,920
We coulda been friends
if you didn't get in our way!

179
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,800
Gum-Gum...

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,970
...Bazooka!

181
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,560
B-Bear Rug!

182
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,370
There! That's the last of them.

183
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,720
No, we're not done yet.

184
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,960
There's still one up there.

185
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,130
Perfect! Now carry them away.

186
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,740
Uh... Umm... Those three are
sound asleep in their bedrooms.

187
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,160
Ain't it great? They're safe and sound!

188
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,660
Like hell they are!

189
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,620
It's the honest truth!

190
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,580
All you have to do is check and see!

191
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,090
Just go up those stairs and down the hall!

192
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,630
Hey, wait a second here.

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,020
The curly cook is gone.

194
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,400
Huh? He was here a second ago.

195
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,890
Where did Sanji wander off to?

196
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,820
Hey, don't laugh! They'll hear you.

197
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,080
They must have done
something during the fray.

198
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,540
We've lost a valuable man.

199
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,160
Cool it!

200
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,620
Yeah, but... He's right. Sanji'll be okay.

201
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,920
But time may be of the essence

202
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,800
for the other three in this zombie mansion.

203
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,930
Don't get cocky just because
you're a little strong, punks!

204
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,350
What?

205
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,980
Deep inside, you're terrified after
one of your friends went missing!

206
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,440
Serves ya right!

207
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,980
At any rate, we'll have to go by
our intuition from here on out...

208
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,530
Hey, losers! You're really scared witless!

209
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,360
I doubt these zombies will tell us
the truth if we threaten them.

210
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,820
Then let's take this pig as our tour guide.

211
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,580
What?!

212
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,380
Go! Go!

213
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,840
H-Hey, you!

214
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,860
Go and learn just how
terrifying our master truly is!

215
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,850
Our real boss is one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea, Gecko Mori--

216
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,600
Ah! I can't say his name!
It's too terrifying!

217
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,230
Merely saying his name
sends chills down my spine!

218
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,740
Your missing crewmates
won't come back unscathed...

219
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,490
You'll lose one pal after the next...!

220
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,700
You will regret coming here!

221
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,700
Before the Seven Warlord's Gecko--

222
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,620
no, before my master's true power,

223
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,460
all of you will taste fear!

224
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
You sure love to ramble on and on!

225
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,840
Then pass this message on to that jerk Moria!

226
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,550
"If anything happens to my crew...

227
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,600
...I'll send you and this
entire island flying!"

228
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,360
Anyway, it won't kill
Sanji to fend for himself.

229
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,500
C'mon, let's go!

230
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,660
Hey! You're seriously taking me with you?!

231
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,590
Say something!

232
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,990
Dear Master,

233
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,950
it looks like some fearsome
people have entered the mansion.

234
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,110
They surprised all of the Surprise Zombies.

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,160
You may fight to your heart's
content for this one night!

253
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,550
Awaken, General Zombies!

254
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,870
Arise, ancient warriors!

255
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,170
The pirates...

256
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,740
The Straw Hats
are a small crew of eight.

257
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,350
Wipe them out and present
them to our master!

258
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,450
Now go, my courageous General Zombies!

259
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,800
Hey, Chopper! According to the newspaper,
aren't a bunch of zoos popping up?

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,840
I've always been against
throwing animals in cages!

261
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,390
This is a reindeer talking here!

262
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,970
I'm against cages, too!
Caging animals is barbaric! But still...

263
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,310
I'll make an exception today...

264
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,400
Please put the animal zombies in cages!

265
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,650
On the next episode of One Piece!

266
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,400
"A Bunch of Animals?
Perona's Wonder Garden!"

267
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,170
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
