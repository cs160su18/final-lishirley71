2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,010
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,780
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,230
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,420
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,380
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,020
You are going to disgrace yourself by crying,

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,850
"Anything but my afro! Anything but my afro!"

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,950
as you beg me to spare your life,
just like last time.

50
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,480
No, that's not how it will go down!

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,900
While waiting for my chance to return,

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,870
I have spent these past five years...

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,010
...growing stronger!

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,260
"A Man's Promise Never Dies!!
To the Friend Waiting Under the Distant Sky!"

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,860
"Evil..."

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,540
A monster that could tower over giants?

57
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,130
Yeah! He's the one who made
all that noise and screamed.

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,410
I bet Luffy's zombie is hooting
and hollering as he runs rampant.

59
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,010
Let's hurry!

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,850
Hey, look! There's Sunny!

61
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,740
Yeah! That skeleton knew
what he was talkin' about!

62
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,750
Indeed!

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,070
Whoosh!

64
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,860
I get it! Those stairs led to the entrance.

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,090
I couldn't tell through all
that fog when we barged in,

66
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,900
but the stairway up was a shortcut
to the last boss's room...

67
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,850
Folding stairs...? Is this how
we're supposed to get down?

68
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,160
Whoa! Man, we've been wiped clean!

69
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,450
The zombies must have done it.

70
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,890
There are muddy footprints everywhere.

71
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,840
What?! They could still be around.

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,560
What a mess!

73
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,350
Yeah, they looted us, all right.
Not that we have anything worth taking.

74
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,330
Are there any zombies...?

75
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,770
How about the guys in question?

76
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,410
I don't see them.

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey, Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,790
Where are you?! Say something!

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,630
They must be inside.

80
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,030
What makes you so sure?

81
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,250
We heard that their zombies will also die

82
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,050
if Luffy and the guys are exposed to sunlight.

83
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,210
Gotcha. Chopper and Franky,
you two search the first floor.

84
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,020
Robin and I will search the second floor.

85
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,360
Zombies could still be hiding
somewhere on board, so be careful!

86
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,460
Right!

87
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,700
Found them! Hey, I found them!

88
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,590
They're in the dining room!
All three of them are up here!

89
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,020
Luffy!

90
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,730
How... could they do such a thing...?

91
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,150
The zombies had a blast "decorating" them...

92
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,870
They were merciless.

93
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,300
Wake up, Luffy! Man, you can't
sleep looking like this!

94
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,820
Luffy!

95
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,100
C'mon!

96
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,710
Leave this to me.

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Hey, wake up! This isn't
the time to catch some Z's!

98
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,660
We've got a serious problem here!

99
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,170
They're still asleep...

100
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,980
Do they even have a nervous system?

101
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,020
They're askin' for it.

102
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,610
Guys, outta the way. I'm using my bazooka.

103
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,080
Nah, it's cool.

104
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,130
At times like this...

105
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,290
There's a hot master swordswoman with meat!

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,260
--"Hot"?
--"Meat"?

107
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,720
--"Master swordswoman"?!
--These guys are hopeless!

108
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,040
Did you hear that?

109
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,020
Yeah! Didn't he say 95-55-85?

110
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,000
These are truly...

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,420
...miraculous measurements!

112
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,360
This is the one.

113
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,300
Yes, yes. You'll look lovely in this.

114
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,840
Now let's get you changed right quick.

115
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,690
Oh, yeah!

116
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,410
Ow!

117
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,740
What are you doing, geezer?!

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Now, now! I'm doing it for your own good.

119
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,390
If you leered at the naked flesh of
the woman about to wed Absalom-sama,

120
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,130
he would make you pay dearly!

121
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,010
Isn't that right, Absalom-sama?

122
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,390
D-Don't tell me...

123
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,850
He was... still...

124
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,130
...in here?!

125
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,690
We're in rottin' trouble!

126
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,940
Damn it! He noticed I was still there.

127
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,630
Hey! Have the General Zombies congregate
in the ceremony hall! Hop to it!

128
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,780
C-Certainly!

129
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,510
Y-You jerk!

130
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,640
--Give my shadow--
--Calm down! Moria isn't here.

131
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,520
Huh? Where am I?

132
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,780
On Sunny.

133
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,490
Sunny?! What are we doing back here?

134
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,830
Wait... None of that was a dream...!

135
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,630
My shadow is missing! This feels so weird.

136
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,300
Hey, this is bad! We have a disaster
on hand! We're all out of food!

137
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,890
Crap!

138
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,450
We had our galley packed nicely,
but now it's empty.

139
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,230
They took off with everything
but some emergency rations.

140
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,200
I can't live off cheese and
dried bread! Gimme meat!

141
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,040
But...

142
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,120
This is really humiliating. I wasn't
taking things seriously enough!

143
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,240
I lost my pirate lunch...

144
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,090
Cheese doesn't cut it! Cheese bites!

145
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,090
By the way, I don't see Nami-san.

146
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,070
Oh, about that...

147
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,310
Yeah...

148
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,320
You let her get abducted?!

149
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,520
Why didn't you follow her
to the ends of the earth?!

150
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,190
Sorry! But it's not like
I could just run after them!

151
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,280
Who the heck is the jerk?!
I'll get her back before you can bat an eye!

152
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,490
Whoa, wait! Please hear me out first!

153
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,650
Okay, I'll make this quick.

154
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,120
Generally speaking, there are
two things we need to get back!

155
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,640
Our food, Nami, and our shadows, right?
That's three things!

156
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,090
Wow, I wasn't expecting you
to rank things in that order.

157
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,010
First off, let me fill you in
about Nami and your shadows.

158
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,890
Wha--? M-M-Marriage?!

159
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,330
Don't be stupid! I won't let that happen!

160
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,770
He's got guts to marry Nami...

161
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,280
And there is a giant version of me?

162
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,290
That's how you make a zombie?

163
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,050
So you've already found Luffy's
and the cook's zombies, Usopp?

164
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,370
I-I had no idea he was one
of the Seven Warlords...

165
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,930
Fear suddenly set in...

166
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,210
You guys didn't know?

167
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,560
How were we supposed to know?!

168
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,100
Oh, man! I don't have time for this.

169
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,290
That's right! If the zombies act just like us,

170
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,740
then I saw your zombie, Zoro.

171
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,280
What was he like?

172
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,910
No different from you.

173
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,500
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame!

174
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,670
But I am covered in scars.

175
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,630
I knew he wasn't you,
since he was wearing sandals.

176
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,230
Okay, whatever.

177
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:14,960
So we need to find a zombie in sandals,
Luffy's giant, and the cook's dogguin.

178
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,930
Our shadows will come back if we
throw salt in their mouths, right?

179
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,600
Yeah, that's how it works.

180
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,590
But honestly, I'm amazed you
discovered that weakness.

181
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,570
All of our info came from that bag of bones,

182
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,750
from how to defeat the zombies
to how to rescue you guys.

183
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,210
Really?! You saw Brook?

184
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,340
Yeah, I did. And I asked him a
stupid question when I saw him.

185
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,010
See, I totally rejected his very
existence when you first brought him

186
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,720
aboard our ship to join our crew...

187
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,100
He might be a flimsy skeleton,

188
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,380
but when I talked to him,
he had an iron backbone!

189
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,270
One fitting for a skeleton...

190
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,780
He...

191
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,780
He...

192
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,570
He's a real man!

193
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,000
I had to ask him...

194
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,950
Well, you'll have to pardon me.

195
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,430
I'm in a hurry. Take care!

196
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,640
Stop right there!

197
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,570
On top of everything you've told us,
answer this one question before you go.

198
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,030
You know how people will react

199
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,410
if you appear before them
as you are now, don't you?

200
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:03,430
You're a talking skeleton!
You'll never make friends.

201
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,540
The abnormal are ostracized.

202
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,250
Franky, what are you...?

203
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,960
Even if you leave the Devil's Sea,
your fate is sealed...

204
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,880
And to make matters worse, you've spent
the past several decades trapped here!

205
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,520
Didn't you say, "I got so
lonely that I wanted to die"?

206
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,860
If I were you, I would have
taken my own life ages ago.

207
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,120
Your existence bites...

208
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,280
Sometimes you act like a gentleman
to hide the core of the conversation.

209
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,150
You're doing all of this because
you want to keep a promise...

210
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,580
What exactly did you promise your crewmates?

211
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,540
You're rather nosy, aren't you?

212
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,720
It's quite simple.

213
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,070
Long ago, we left a member of my
crew behind at a certain location.

214
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,140
It was unavoidable, yet sad.

215
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,150
When we set sail, we vehemently
swore that we would return.

216
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,810
But then we were annihilated on these seas,

217
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,630
preventing us from keeping our promise.

218
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:22,270
As the sole survivor from our ship,
it is my duty to tell him what has happened!

219
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,370
I believe it has been... fifty years
now since the day we died.

220
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,210
Fifty years?! Hey, that was ages ago!

221
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,670
I wasn't even born yet!

222
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,810
Sorry, but I doubt he's been waiting that long!

223
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,050
What right...?!

224
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,280
What right do I have to decide
whether or not he's still waiting?

225
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,890
If he's still waiting for us,
believing that we'll keep our promise...

226
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,660
Can you imagine how lonesome he must feel?

227
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:09,750
If he's still waiting while under
the belief that we've betrayed him,

228
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,460
can you imagine how miserable he must be?

229
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,420
Man...

230
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,970
We swore to reunite with my crewmate
off some capes. His name is...

231
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,340
...Laboon!

232
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,940
He was a young whale,

233
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,140
so we couldn't possibly bring him
with us on our dangerous voyage.

234
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,560
A whale...?

235
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,930
Yeah...

236
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,660
Goodbye!

237
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,490
Later! Take care!

238
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,050
I imagine he's grown rather big by now.

239
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,920
Your crewmate... is a whale?

240
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:05,070
That's right. I can't help but
think he still believes in us.

241
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,060
Perhaps he thinks we'll play
our typical lively music

242
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,970
and come back waving.

243
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,900
I doubt he will forgive us for
irresponsibly dying on him...

244
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,110
We made a selfish promise

245
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,450
and died under a distant sky where
our voices couldn't reach him.

246
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,820
"I'm sorry we died" could never cut it!

247
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,340
We gave our word as men that we would return!

248
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,470
And that's why he's still alive...

249
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,870
Laboon...

250
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,040
Seriously?

251
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,030
It's him...

252
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,180
Yeah.

253
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,390
Oh, yeah. Chopper wasn't there for this, huh?

254
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,080
You...! What the hell did
you do to my special seat?!

255
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,060
I'm strong, aren't I?

256
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,670
Our fight isn't over yet!
So we have to fight again.

257
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,300
Your buddies're dead,
but I'm your rival forever.

258
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,370
We definitely have to fight again
in order to decide who is stronger.

259
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,160
After going around the Grand Line,
we'll come back to see you again.

260
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,420
When I come back, let's fight again!

261
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,780
Hmmm. This is good.

262
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,360
This is the symbol of our promise to fight again.

263
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,890
Until we come back, don't remove
that mark by hitting your head.

264
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,390
We know him.

265
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,490
We know that whale.

266
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,710
That cape on the Grand Line...?

267
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:33,260
Whoa, wait! He's still waiting after fifty years?!

268
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,890
What a touching story!

269
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,060
I didn't expect that skeleton
to have a past like that...

270
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,850
On the next episode of One Piece!

271
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,060
"I Swear to Go See Him!!
Brook and the Cape of Promise!"

272
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,210
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
