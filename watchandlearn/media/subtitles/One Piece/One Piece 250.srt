2
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,670
You bastard!

3
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,600
The members of CP9 have
finally made themselves known.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Lucci, Kaku, Blueno and Kalifa.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,270
Luffy and Zoro stood up to them
to put a stop to their scheme.

6
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,820
However, Lucci, who has Cat-Cat
fruit powers, crushed them.

7
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,780
CP9 has found out that Franky is Cutty Flam

8
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,200
and has the blueprints for
the ancient weapon Pluton.

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,540
I've got nothing I could give you jerks!

10
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,090
And they caught Franky,
who challenged them, in the blink of an eye.

11
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,050
Man, that was rough.

12
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,390
I'll pay him back two times over.

13
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,560
Not until we get what we want,
shipwright Cutty Flam.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,860
The blueprints are not here!

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Stay back!

16
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
Where am I?

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,180
Dammit!

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,100
Why the hell is this happening?

19
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Dammit! I'd better hurry!

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,860
Okay! Just as I planned.

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,720
We were taken in by the Government.

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,840
They're gonna make us the culprits
for attacking the Judicial Ship...

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,640
...because they want to question Tom-san
as a criminal to obtain the blueprints.

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,560
After all this... can you still
say that you're innocent?!

25
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,070
If we can't somehow stop them
from taking Tom-san away...

26
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,940
...I'll never...

27
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,570
...forgive you for the rest of my life, Franky!

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,370
I'll never--

29
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,830
Stop it!

30
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,120
Tom-san...

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,540
Don't blame him, Iceberg.

32
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,050
It's not Franky's fault.

33
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,050
You're still saying that, even at this point?!

34
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,010
Tom-san!

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,390
I'm sorry! I made this harpoon!

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,680
I made it so that it can't come
out once it pierces its target!

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
Dammit!

38
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,520
Don't apologize. This is nothing.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,360
Look! They're over there!

40
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,400
Tom is on the ground!

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,110
Why is he seriously injured like that?!

42
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,280
Then, it wasn't them who made the raid?

43
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,660
The townspeople are here.

44
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,750
Well, then...

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,670
...shall we head to the town, too?

46
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,290
You bastard, Spanda!

47
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,420
That's "Spandam"...

48
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,010
...you criminals...

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,680
It's all right! Now let's move forward

50
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,640
with the sun always in our hearts

51
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,980
As power passes through our clasped hands

52
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,650
let's grab hold of our wishes

53
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:34,670
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

54
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:42,050
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

55
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,930
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

56
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,060
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

57
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,440
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

58
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,400
but what you cherish most will be right there

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,450
And if you get into a jam

60
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,450
I'll always be there to protect you

61
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,620
It's all right! Now let's move forward

62
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,210
with the sun always in our hearts

63
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,170
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

64
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,510
and gaze at the light beyond

65
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,430
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,680
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,640
So let's grab hold of our wishes

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,440
under the same flag-- together, we're one

69
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,070
One Piece

70
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:00,040
"The End of the Legendary Man!
The Day the Sea Train Cried"

71
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,590
These are the raid culprits.

72
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,630
Please rest easy, everyone.

73
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,050
We, CP5, brought them down
after they made the raid.

74
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,010
They can't cause any more trouble.

75
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,560
He would've been found
not guilty in today's trial...

76
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,730
So then, why did Tom do something like that?

77
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,940
So he was a friend of the
King of the Pirates after all, huh?

78
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,780
Pleased to meet you.

79
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm Spandam from CP5.

80
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,110
You happened to be there?
Thank you. You saved us.

81
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,740
Please hand them over to us,
as we would like to investigate them.

82
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,880
Try making excuses if you like.
Our trustworthiness is worlds apart.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,380
I'll get the blueprints of the ancient weapon.

84
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,800
--Ribbit, ribbit.
--How terrible...

85
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,600
First, about the sea train,
all I can say is, splendid.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,270
I can see it'll contribute greatly
to the growth of Water Seven.

87
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,440
For that, on the previous charge
for building Gold Roger's ship,

88
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,530
your acquittal today had
pretty much been decided.

89
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,950
So then, why did you commit another crime?

90
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,910
That's a load of crap!

91
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,160
We're not the ones who
raided the Judicial Ship!

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,120
It was that Spandam guy who did it!

93
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,340
Huh?

94
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,210
No way!

95
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,630
What's got into that disciple of Tom's,
suddenly cracking jokes?

96
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,430
What would CP5, a Government entity,
gain by sinking a Judicial Ship?

97
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,810
What a stupid thing to say!
That's not possible at all!

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,730
Cutty Flam, was it?

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,030
To start with, we caught you
red-handed on one of the raid ships.

100
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:57,030
In addition, weren't those raid
ships built by your company?

101
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,710
Ships that would do something like that...

102
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,380
They're... no longer...

103
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,220
...my ships!

104
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,020
Tom tore his handcuffs apart!

105
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Ready!

106
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,740
Tom-san... hit Franky for the first time...

107
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,740
What'd you do that for?!

108
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,290
"They're no longer my ships," you say?

109
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,080
You can say anything but that!

110
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,710
What's wrong with saying that?!
I'm regretting it!

111
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,720
If only those ships didn't exist,
no one would have had to get hurt!

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,970
No matter what kind of ship it is,
the act of building it...

113
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,770
...is neither an act of good nor evil!

114
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,610
I don't care what kind of
ships you choose to build,

115
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,570
but even if the ships you built hurt someone,

116
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,860
or even if they destroy the world,

117
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,570
at least the one who created
them must love them!

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,580
Their creator mustn't deny them!

119
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,290
Don't blame the ships!

120
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,880
A man should be resolutely proud...
of the ships he created!

121
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,060
Iceberg...

122
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,020
Franky...

123
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,150
Don't interfere in what I'm about to do...

124
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,740
No matter what.

125
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,580
It's the World Government
who pinned the crime on us.

126
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,830
It's also the World Government who judges it.

127
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,040
There's no way that we'll
get cleared of suspicion.

128
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,790
This is it.

129
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,420
It must be really tough for you to see
your innocent ships being used like this.

130
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,920
You must want to beat up
that guy, right, Franky?

131
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,350
Tom-san!

132
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,940
Tom started going on a rampage!

133
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,320
--Ribbit!
--Oh, my God...

134
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,400
Please stop! If you lay
one more finger on him...!

135
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,610
Do you...

136
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,160
...understand the pain he's feeling?!

137
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,830
F-Fire!

138
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,870
They shot him...

139
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,050
Tom-san!

140
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Tom-san!

141
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,030
Tranquillizer bullets, huh?

142
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,580
You damn fishman with superhuman
strength! That serves you right!

143
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,550
Tom-san! Why'd you do that?!

144
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,090
Hey, guys! What're you doing?!
Hurry up and capture them!

145
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,850
We'll take everyone from the ferocious
Tom's Workers company to Enies Lobby!

146
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,760
To think that Tom is such a dangerous person...

147
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,270
What the hell is he thinking?!

148
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,650
He really sold his soul to pirates!

149
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,690
He made that many battleships and
waited for an opportunity like this!

150
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,650
You bastards! How dare you
talk like that to Tom-san?!

151
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,860
Stop it.

152
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,240
It's all right.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,700
But...!

154
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,580
Judge...

155
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
Hm?

156
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,960
I'll confess to the charge of
making a raid on the Judicial Ship.

157
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,040
What?!

158
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,500
Hey! Tom-san! Don't!

159
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,590
But I have a favor to ask.

160
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,500
Shut up, you stupid fishman!

161
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,960
Who'd listen to a criminal's...

162
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,630
Keep your mouth shut, CP5!

163
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,130
What?!

164
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,970
So, what is the favor?

165
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,220
If I can get one charge eliminated
for our building the sea train...

166
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,980
...I'd like today's charge to be eliminated.

167
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,100
What?

168
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,230
Even if that wish is granted,
you'll just go back to square one.

169
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,320
You'll end up with the crime of building
a ship for the King of the Pirates,

170
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,410
which will result in the maximum penalty.

171
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,070
Yeah, I prefer that.

172
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,750
About assisting that Roger guy...

173
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,460
I'm resolutely proud of it!

174
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,250
How selfish...

175
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,130
To think that he's proud of
assisting the King of the Pirates...

176
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,590
Traitor!

177
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,800
--Ferocious fishman!
--Damn fishman!

178
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,090
Tom-san... Why?!

179
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,760
It's fine.

180
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,890
Listen. Don't blame yourself, okay?

181
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,360
I never thought that the Government
would use force to get the blueprints.

182
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,980
I was at a bit of a disadvantage
due to the matter with Roger.

183
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,860
But even so, you didn't have to--

184
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,360
Don't worry.

185
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,410
Look at the town. Even if my charge
goes back to what it was 14 years ago,

186
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,660
everything is different from then.

187
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,830
This island is full of energy now.

188
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,080
This is just the beginning.

189
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,590
No matter what happens to me,

190
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,050
I can be of help to the town.

191
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,220
My dream has...

192
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,010
...finally... begun to run.

193
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,430
Tom-san!

194
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,230
Tom-san!

195
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,240
Iceberg... Franky...

196
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,070
Take care of the blueprints.

197
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,290
Kokoro-san... Yokozuna...

198
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,000
Thanks for everything.

199
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,210
The tranquilizers have finally started working!

200
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,920
Capture those three culprits
for the Judicial Ship raid!

201
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,130
Yes, sir!

202
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,300
Hold it!

203
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,010
--Huh?
--I'm changing the charges.

204
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,480
For the charge of building the pirate ship
for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates,

205
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,610
we'll take shipbuilding
engineer Tom to Enies Lobby.

206
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,520
That is all.

207
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,360
What got into that old geezer?

208
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,780
Oh, well. I don't have
business with his disciples.

209
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,620
Release those two disciples!

210
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,380
Tom-san can no longer be saved.

211
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,840
If it's the World Government we're
up against, there's nothing we can do!

212
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,180
Bear it. Tom-san saved you two!

213
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,970
If you make an enemy of them,

214
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,430
no matter how many lives
you have, it's not enough!

215
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,100
Enies Lobby is the judicial island
owned by the Government.

216
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,810
No criminals taken there...

217
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,690
...have ever returned!

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,280
The sea train is ready! We can take him now!

219
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,780
Good!

220
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,660
Kokoro-san...

221
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,990
Hey, you guys! Hurry up and take away...

222
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,160
I...

223
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,000
...this heavy, crazy fishman!

224
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,920
I can't do that!

225
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,630
Ah!

226
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,210
Hey!

227
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,390
Stop it!

228
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,020
Spandam-san's face got bent!

229
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,610
This time, Tom's disciple
started going on a rampage!

230
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,240
--Stop it!
--Ribbit, ribbit!

231
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,530
Capture him! The rest of you, take Tom away!

232
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,410
Fine by me! I won't let you take him away!

233
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,950
You're allowed to shoot him!

234
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,580
Give us Tom-san back!

235
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,250
Are you okay?!

236
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,550
Hurry up and run!

237
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,300
Fire!

238
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,060
Dammit! He got away!

239
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,480
I'll never let that Cutty Flam
brat get away with this!

240
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,900
He is truly a criminal!

241
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,120
Once this case is over,
I'll have him sent to the gallows!

242
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,410
--Spandam-san!
--What do you want?!

243
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,000
I-It's Cutty Flam!

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,540
What?!

245
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,080
He came this far after us!

246
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,670
He's standing on the railway with some weapon!

247
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,010
Stay there, Yokozuna.

248
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,760
Ribbit...

249
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,680
Is he stupid or what?

250
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,930
What should we do?

251
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,930
Are you stupid, too?!

252
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,150
Just keep going; give him what he wants.
Don't be concerned about him!

253
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,480
Y-Yes, sir.

254
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,490
Stop, Puffing Tom!

255
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,410
Where are you taking your creator to?!

256
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,800
Ribbit, ribbit...!

257
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,670
I won't let you pass here!

258
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,390
Give Tom-san back to us!

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,190
Stop! Sea train!

260
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,990
I see. Your parents abandoned you, huh?

261
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,360
That's so funny!

262
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,320
Hey, you're laughing too hard!

263
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,080
Okay, then! Come resolutely to my place!

264
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,040
Tom-san...

265
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't wanna build ships anymore!

266
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:34,000
I can't love ships that hurt
the people I really care about!

267
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,420
But, Tom-san...

268
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,760
...you're my goal after all!

269
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,310
So I want you to come back
and teach me again...

270
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,280
...because I want to...

271
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,410
...build a dream ship someday, too.

272
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,420
A ship that resolutely and proudly traverses

273
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,340
even uncharted waves at edges of the earth!

274
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,760
A dream ship like that!

275
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,150
What we heard about Tom
is that he had good skills,

276
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,660
but he was a ferocious and intractable
fishman with superhuman strength.

277
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,950
Even if we ask the townspeople,
they just speak ambiguously.

278
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,410
It must be tough to be a disciple that has
to defend such a man, huh, Cutty Flam?

279
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,380
That's not even worth responding to.

280
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,500
You Government people are all crap!

281
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,800
What?! Hey, hey...

282
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,010
At that time, more than 100 people,
including marines and officials,

283
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,260
were severely injured here in Water Seven.

284
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,220
The culprit behind it was you.

285
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,190
You had a lot to answer for, causing the
World Government that much trouble,

286
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,020
but since you were confirmed dead in
the sea train accident on that very day,

287
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,530
your charge was annulled.

288
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,490
Now, we'll take you to
Enies Lobby as a criminal.

289
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,200
You can take your time there
answering my question...

290
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,410
...about the whereabouts
of the blueprints for Pluton.

291
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,750
--Blueno.
--Yeah. It just connected.

292
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,470
When I reported this case to our chief,

293
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,060
he said he wanted to talk
to you right away, so...

294
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,770
Your chief? Hm?

295
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,940
Please go ahead, Chief.

296
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,480
Ouch! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

297
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,690
I spilled the coffee!

298
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,530
Dammit! Stupid coffee!

299
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,240
What the hell?

300
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,990
Are you there...

301
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,370
...Cutty Flam?

302
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,080
--Hm?
--It's been a while.

303
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,540
I never thought you'd survived that...

304
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,010
It's hard to believe, but I'm happy to hear it.

305
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,970
Who the hell are you?

306
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,220
During these past eight years...
every time my scars hurt,

307
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,850
I was tormented by an anger that
I couldn't take out on anyone...

308
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,770
...because the culprit who hurt me died!

309
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,320
I'll ask you again! Who the hell are you?!

310
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,700
You don't remember me?

311
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,330
I'm the man who was from Cipher Pol No. 5

312
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,130
and arrested Tom's Workers red-handed for
attacking the Judicial Ship eight years ago!

313
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,240
We had a dream that day

314
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,080
Our belief in ourselves

315
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,300
makes us able to cross the wildly surging ocean

316
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:56,850
You're braver and more caring than anyone else

317
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:06,860
If you ever depart this ship
and live in a different world

318
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:15,660
In the end, we can all surely smile

319
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,090
I've been eagerly looking forward to seeing you.

320
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,630
Don't tell me... Is that you, Spanda?!

321
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,680
