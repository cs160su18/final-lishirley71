2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,000
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who will be executed!

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,490
He got over the encircling walls in order to
make it to the scaffold with Jimbei's help

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,630
and faced the 3 admirals!

63
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,100
The Whitebeards then made
it to the plaza, too!

64
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,210
An all-out battle between the Navy and
the beards has begun at the Oris Plaza!

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,770
Ice Block: Partisan!

66
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,730
Pops, move on!

67
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm counting on you!

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,370
All you have is courage.

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,480
But if you're not strong enough,

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,830
you can't save him no
matter how hard you try.

71
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,380
Why don't you just get lost?

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,080
He is nothing but a bundle of energy
who just bluffs. Young and clumsy.

73
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,190
But I like fools like him.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,490
If I let you wreak havoc,
this island won't survive!

75
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,040
Then why don't you protect it?

76
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm on my way, Ace!

77
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,810
If you wanna go further,
you have to kill me first!

78
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,760
"The Power That Will Shorten One's
Life! Energy Hormone, Redux!"

79
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,790
Garp the hero...

80
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,370
...took part in their protection!

81
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,330
He fought against Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates 20 years ago

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,010
and made his name in the world
- he's a legendary Navy soldier!

83
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:16,020
I heard that it was Garp who fought Roger's
competitor--Shiki the Golden Lion...

84
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,690
...here in Marineford with Sengoku
and imprisoned him in Impel Down!

85
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,700
Don't get tripped up by his name, you fools!

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,950
He's just an old soldier!

87
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,170
If you'd lived through that
era, you should know that...

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,090
...you should focus on the
enemy in front of you!

89
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,170
Hound Blaze!

90
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,300
You gotta stop destroying the city!

91
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,600
I told you to protect it!

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,530
Hurry and execute Ace!

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,870
--Get a substitute right away!
--Yes, sir!

94
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,660
Make a path!

95
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,960
A path to rescue Ace!

96
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,920
We still got those pains in the ass here!

97
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,510
I won't let you do it, monster!

98
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,930
I'll show you...

99
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,910
...the power of the New World!

100
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,280
--Now is the chance!
--Get to the scaffold!

101
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,660
How is he?

102
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
Not good at all! First aid won't help him!

103
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,210
He needs proper treatment!

104
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,460
Straw boy can't fight anymore!

105
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,850
But...

106
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,800
What's the matter, "Fire Fist?"

107
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,690
Ace...

108
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,460
Gol D. Roger?

109
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,090
You mean Gold Roger? Did
you ask me if I know him?

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't you realize why there is so much
destruction in the world caused by pirates?

111
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,470
It's all Roger's fault!

112
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,280
His fault?

113
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,390
I heard that right before his execution,

114
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,610
he bullshitted about this
great treasure thing...

115
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,860
...causing the idiot pirates
who believed him to run wild.

116
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,030
He should've never been
born in the first place!

117
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,490
He was just a worthless bastard!

118
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,870
Even after his death, he causes
the pirates to roam the seas!

119
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,790
He's such a nuisance--living or dead!

120
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,200
He was the biggest piece of shit
the world's ever! Remember that!

121
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,810
Huh? What's wrong? What
are you getting mad for?

122
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,390
I mean, who are you, brat?!

123
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,790
What have you done in the city, Ace?

124
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,380
They're making a fuss over some punks
who almost got killed by a kid.

125
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,800
Oh, I thought they were dead.

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,850
What did you say?! If you cause trouble,
I'm the one who'll get chewed out!

127
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,690
Are you listening, Ace?!

128
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,940
Honestly! How could he just
leave a kid like this with me?!

129
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,020
You wanna know about Roger?

130
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,030
He was just a great liar and a murderer!

131
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,700
It makes me laugh that they
call him "King of the Pirates!"

132
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,880
--He was more like the King of the Bullshitters!
--That's right!

133
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,630
Roger?

134
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,120
Don't mention the name
that makes me sick, brat!

135
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,470
It's ruining my drink! Go away!

136
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,310
What are you looking at?!

137
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,810
What do you think you're
doing, you little shit!

138
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Look at you! You got beaten pretty badly!

139
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,170
Hey, Ace? I heard that you're
out of control these days.

140
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,470
Old man, you have a grandson, right?

141
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,430
Does he look happy?

142
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,730
Oh, you're talking about Luffy!

143
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,890
He's growing up in fine feather!

144
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,980
--Old man.
--Huh?

145
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,980
Do you think...

146
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,860
...that I deserved to be born?

147
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,140
That's something...

148
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,050
...you'll see as you live.

149
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,090
Carry Straw boy to the ship in a hurry!

150
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,220
I have no choice! We gotta
save Ace boy without him...

151
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,560
Ivan-chan...

152
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,110
You came around!

153
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,580
Could you do me a favor one last time?

154
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,200
We're almost there! We'll be there soon, Ace!

155
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,150
Clear the way!

156
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,370
I'm...

157
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,290
Dammit!

158
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,520
Ace-san, wait for me! I'll
save you with my life!

159
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,490
We're almost there!

160
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,210
We're on our way, Ace!

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,900
--Ace, we'll save you at any cost!
--Wait for us, Ace!

162
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,030
Don't give up!

163
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Dammit! My mind is so warped!
It's not the right time for this!

164
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,790
Pops and brother and friends are...

165
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,500
...going down one by one bleeding, but...!

166
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,140
Don't say "one last time!"
It'll bring bad luck!

167
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,800
Please! Can you...

168
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,730
I'm so happy and I can't stop crying!

169
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,760
At this last moment, I'm starting
to think that I wanna live!

170
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,280
I beg you! Ivan-chan!

171
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,200
Are you serious about this?!

172
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,400
--Captain Buggy!
--He's awake!

173
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,690
--He's alive!
--I'm so relieved!

174
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,900
What happened to me?

175
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,860
You got frozen by Aokiji and...

176
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,410
Captain Buggy!

177
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,290
Oh no! It's too late!

178
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,790
Damn! You said that you were
gonna conquer the world!

179
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,300
We really believed in you!

180
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,200
Oh no!

181
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,480
Ouch!

182
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,010
I got it!

183
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,060
Captain Buggy wanted to show us
how to save our frozen mates!

184
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,660
With his frozen body? How great he is!

185
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,720
Let's carry all the other
frozen guys to the water!

186
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,530
Yeah!

187
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,270
Hey, before that...

188
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,250
Ow! Save me first, you fools! I mean...

189
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,540
Please help me, I'm drowning...

190
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,420
Captain Buggy!

191
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,930
You saved our lives how many times now?!

192
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,560
Damn, you're great! We'll follow
you to the end of the world!

193
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,770
You guys! Thank me as much as you want!

194
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,690
Looks like I still have my luck!

195
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,450
By the way, where's Mr. 3?

196
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,990
The last time we saw Brother 3 was
before the encircling walls came up.

197
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,070
That bastard! He made it out of here!

198
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,270
Huh? Is this the wall that
you're talking about?

199
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,170
The Navy tried to round up
the Whitebeards with this!

200
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,380
We're caged birds because of this!

201
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,570
How ridiculous!

202
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,650
Do they really think that they
can stop me with this cheap wall?

203
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,940
Damn you, Navy! Be ready for it!

204
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,650
Don't even think that you
can get away with this!

205
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,810
Amazing! To have such conviction
after just being defrosted!

206
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,670
That's how I am!

207
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,910
But what should I do?!

208
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,250
Get out of my way, magma brat!

209
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,430
Damn!

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,370
Pops!

211
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,090
Even you can't win out against
the onslaught of time,

212
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,020
Whitebeard!

213
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,650
That's what I was afraid of the most!

214
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,740
Are you telling me to draw their
sympathy by putting these on?

215
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,820
Pops!

216
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,040
If you have an unguarded moment,
you will lose the fight!

217
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,980
Marco!

218
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
You can't look away like that!

219
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,420
Jozu!

220
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,600
Should I be the last voice
you hear before you die?

221
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,740
Pops!

222
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,580
--Hey, Pops is...!
--What?!

223
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,870
Hey! It's too late for you to go out now!

224
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,170
Look, Coby, there's no question!
It's obviously the Navy's victory!

225
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,340
Akainu-san got Whitebeard

226
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,380
and Kizaru-san and Aokiji-san got Marco

227
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,450
and Jozu, 1st and 3rd division commanders!

228
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,980
And Straw Hat can't fight anymore
after getting beaten so bad!

229
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,640
That was the best they can do
against all the forces of the Navy!

230
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,780
I will be much much stronger and...

231
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,400
I'll become a Navy...

232
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,280
...ad...

233
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,240
...admiral someday!

234
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,410
Whoa! Oh, I mean...

235
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,090
I-I-I'm sorry! I got carried away!

236
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,130
It's embarrassing! I wanna crawl in a hole!

237
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,490
After I met you, I became
emboldened a little bit...

238
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,180
Coby!

239
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,300
You wanna fight me, right?

240
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,050
Then, of course you have to
become such a heavy hitter!

241
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,310
After all, it was just a pipe
dream for me to become an admiral!

242
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:37,150
Even Luffy-san's strength gave out
before he accomplished his goal!

243
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:44,070
It's impossible for me because all I
do is run despite being a Navy soldier!

244
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,740
It's just impossible!

245
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,080
It's over already! So let's just
sit back and enjoy it from here!

246
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,400
Alright, Coby?

247
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,380
Are you asking me to inject
another shot of Energy Hormone?!

248
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,250
That's insane!

249
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,040
You gotta stop it now! You've
been fighting since Impel Down!

250
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,850
You got poisoned and you were almost killed!

251
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,270
You're pushing it too far already!

252
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:20,470
Like I said before, Energy Hormone is
nothing more than a temporary treatment!

253
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,620
If you just keep using it, you
will die for sure afterwards!

254
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,050
If I'd be able to do all I could...

255
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,130
I'd be happy to die!

256
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,520
Let me fight, Ivan-chan!

257
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,060
--Pops got beaten!
--Marco! Jozu!

258
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,900
If I can't fight now

259
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,530
and if I can't rescue Ace, I...

260
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,490
I'd rather take my own life afterwards!!

261
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,120
Let me have the strength to fight for now!

262
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,520
I said I can't! If I let you die now,
I'd be too ashamed to face Dragon!

263
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,980
You hardheaded fool!

264
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,160
Where's the other guy?!
What's taking him so long?!

265
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,040
Since it was such short notice, he's
having trouble getting ready...

266
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,880
Hey, hurry up!

267
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,040
Alright, let's go!

268
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,380
A-Ace...

269
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,220
All right!

270
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,310
Do whatever you want!

271
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,650
Hey, what are you doing to Straw Hat?!

272
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,710
S-Straw Hat is...!

273
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,630
N-No way! I thought he received
a mortal wound by getting kicked

274
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,770
in the teeth by Kizaru-san!

275
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,060
H-Hey! Where are you going?!
It's too dangerous!

276
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,050
Coby...

277
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,240
Luffy-san!

278
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,200
Luffy!

279
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,990
Ace!!

280
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,090
Using Ivankov's Energy Hormone,

281
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,470
Luffy works up the last of
his strength and runs forth.

282
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,340
But the Navy forces form a
massive wall in his path.

283
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,220
Among them stands one young
man trying to motivate himself

284
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,940
to achieve the heights
he once swore to reach.

285
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

286
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,230
"To Live Up to a Promise!
Luffy and Coby Collide!"

287
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
