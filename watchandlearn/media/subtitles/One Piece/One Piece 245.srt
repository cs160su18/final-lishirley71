00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,120
These are the fake blueprints
that you passed off on us earlier.

3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,460
When I look at it carefully,
there're signatures by the architects.

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,840
"Tom," "Iceberg," and "Cutty Flam."

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
At the end, there's a
company name: "Tom's Workers."

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,760
I remember hearing this
name Cutty Flam before.

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,350
Tom's other disciple Cutty Flam is still alive...

8
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,640
...and lives in this town...

9
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,440
...after changing his name to Franky!

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,790
Now, you go ahead! Ahead of us!
Cut down the door and make a dash!

11
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,910
--Go ahead!
--What the hell?! Don't order me around!

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,800
Where's Robin?!

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,510
--Luffy!
--Luffy!

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,310
Robin! I've finally found you!

15
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,230
Hey, Luffy! Where the hell have you been?!

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,730
Robin! I'm glad that I could see you again!

17
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,820
Hold on a sec... What's going on here?

18
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,030
Well, well, well...

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,210
I-Iceberg-san...

20
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,130
Wh-What the hell...

21
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,260
...is going on?!

22
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,600
Paulie... Why... didn't you run?

23
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,070
What's going on?

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,610
This looks... as if...

25
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,620
...they're the culprits who tried to kill you!

26
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,960
Why are you guys dressed like that?!

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,840
Hey! Kalifa...! Blueno...! Kaku...! Lucci...!

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,470
Stop joking, you bastards!

29
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,690
It's all right! Now let's move forward

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,650
with the sun always in our hearts

31
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,990
As power passes through our clasped hands

32
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,660
let's grab hold of our wishes

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,630
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,970
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

35
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:31,940
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

36
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:39,070
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

37
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,450
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

38
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,410
but what you cherish most will be right there

39
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,410
And if you get into a jam

40
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,460
I'll always be there to protect you

41
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,630
It's all right! Now let's move forward

42
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,170
with the sun always in our hearts

43
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,180
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

44
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,470
and gaze at the light beyond

45
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,390
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

46
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,690
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

47
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,650
So let's grab hold of our wishes

48
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,450
under the same flag-- together, we're one

49
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,070
One Piece

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:43,050
"Come Back, Robin! Showdown with CP9!"

51
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,010
Oh, yeah!

52
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,970
They're some of the shipwrights
who were with you! Right?!

53
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,440
Come to think of it, I know
that square long-nosed guy.

54
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,400
Could this mean... that the
assassination was an inside job?!

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,440
What? What do you mean?!

56
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,660
Paulie, to tell you the truth,
we're Government intelligence agents.

57
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,330
Well, you'd forgive us if we apologized, right?

58
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,590
We were fellow shipwrights who worked
together building ships every day.

59
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,380
If you can't believe me because this is too sudden,
shall I step on Iceberg's face or something?

60
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,720
Stop messing around! That's enough...

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,690
After all, the bull-masked man's voice I
heard earlier is the same voice as yours!

62
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,690
Dammit, you bastard! You can talk just fine!

63
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,490
How dare you mock us?!

64
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,950
Don't, Paulie!

65
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,540
Pipe Hitch Knives!

66
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,710
Finger Pistol!

67
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,140
You still haven't learned your lesson, Paulie?

68
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,240
Hey! Rope guy!

69
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,950
Why...?

70
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,120
You guys...

71
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,930
Stop this pointless resistance.

72
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,810
We've mastered techniques beyond
the limits of human abilities.

73
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,600
After years of training, these techniques,

74
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,940
called the "Six Powers," allow human
bodies to be a match for weapons.

75
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,610
Once one masters them, he alone
is as strong as 100 people together.

76
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,240
Coo coo! Don't get carried away with gambling.

77
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,700
You dummy! I was lucky today.
That's why I'm treating you guys!

78
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,040
Blueno! Bring us more alcohol!

79
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,210
Okay!

80
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,220
Kalifa! You're dressed like that again?!

81
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,970
Stop it, Paulie. Just don't look at her. Right?

82
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,110
Why are you guys...?

83
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,070
Well, never mind.

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,950
Either way, you're gonna be killed.

85
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,080
This is sad, but my friend...

86
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,000
Lucci! You...!

87
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,960
Stop it! You jerk!

88
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,430
Gum-Gum...

89
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,690
--Iron Body.
--...Gatling!

90
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,450
What? It's not working at all!

91
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,920
How annoying... Shave!

92
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,960
He disappeared!

93
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,680
Finger Pistol!

94
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,940
Luffy!

95
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,120
If you had a flesh-and-blood body, you would've
gotten a hole in your neck and died instantly...

96
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
...rubber man.

97
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,980
What're you doing, Straw Hat?

98
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,190
You're planning to kill him, aren't you?!

99
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,150
I thought you were all shipwright
friends who worked together!

100
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,410
Up until earlier, yes.
But that's no longer the case.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,910
Then you guys really are traitors?!

102
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,870
Fine, then!

103
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,960
At any rate, I promised him

104
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,050
that we'd beat the crap out of those
who're trying to kill Ice pops together!

105
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,260
Why are you siding with Paulie?

106
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,430
Because I have some business
with you people, too!

107
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,480
Hey, Robin! Why are you with jerks like them?!

108
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,480
If you wanna leave us, tell us the reason!

109
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,450
He's right! They said they work
for the Government! So why?!

110
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,580
You're not listening, are you?

111
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,500
I did say goodbye to Cook and Doctor.

112
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,630
You didn't tell them?

113
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,590
I did! But I can't accept it, either! Why, Robin?!

114
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,850
To make my wish come true...

115
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,810
A wish that can never come true if I'm with you!

116
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,240
In order to make it happen, I don't
care what sacrifices need to be made!

117
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,750
That's why... you set your friends up
as assassins without hesitation?

118
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,080
What's that wish of yours?!

119
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,710
I don't need to tell you.

120
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,800
This is insane!

121
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,260
That woman is...!

122
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,760
Are you out of your mind, Nico Robin?!

123
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600
Do you realize what you're about to do?!

124
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,350
You no longer have the right to say anything!

125
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,230
Keep your mouth shut!

126
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,150
Iceberg-san!

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,700
I won't let anyone get in my way!

128
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,090
I won't let anyone get in my way!

129
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,730
Hey, Robin! What're you doing?!

130
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,980
Do you really mean it?!

131
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,020
Robin! What happened to you?!

132
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,950
Are you really our enemy now?! Robin!

133
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,660
Sorry, but I need you guys to stop now.

134
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,800
We have to find an important
person now, so we're in a hurry.

135
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,220
We no longer have business here.

136
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,510
We don't have any business
with you guys, either.

137
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,140
Kalifa, how much time is left?

138
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,390
Two minutes.

139
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,240
I know this is sudden, but this building
is to be set aflame in two minutes.

140
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,200
--What?
--What?!

141
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,280
What'd you say?!

142
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,740
Fire is an effective tool for
destroying various types of evidence.

143
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,290
If you don't wanna burn to death,
you should leave the building immediately.

144
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,460
Well, of course...

145
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,220
...that is, if you could.

146
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,100
Looks like they intend to eliminate us.

147
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,980
It also seems that Nico Robin
wants to be on their side.

148
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,650
Luffy, were you able to accept
Robin's leaving the ship?

149
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,780
How could I?!

150
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,950
Well, you don't have to shout like that.

151
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,790
Soon, several rooms on the first
floor will burst into flames.

152
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,040
Well, the culprits are pirates.

153
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Things like this can happen.

154
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
You bastards...!

155
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,300
To think that you do as you please
while pretending someone else did it...

156
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,890
You sure have bad taste!

157
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,060
You guys are already criminals. No harm done.

158
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,980
Well, then...

159
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,980
I'll go on ahead and leave now.

160
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,950
Yeah, you completed your job. Thanks.

161
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,990
Wait, Robin!

162
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,450
I won't allow it!

163
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,620
Goodbye.

164
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,910
Robin!

165
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,750
Don't...

166
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,040
...let Nico Robin go.

167
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,470
Where're you going this time...
when we finally found you?!

168
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,880
Outta my way, you bastard!

169
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,340
Iron Body.

170
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,190
Why are their bodies so hard?!

171
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,150
Our bodies are well trained.

172
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,570
We can raise our bodies' solidity
to be as hard as iron crust.

173
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,410
However... that's not to say
defense is all we can do.

174
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,080
I said outta my way!

175
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,580
Paper Art.

176
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,430
Ahh... He's dodging all the
punches... when he's that big!

177
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,890
He's fluttering like paper!

178
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,110
Robin!

179
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,320
Wait!

180
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,110
You son of a...!

181
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,740
Gum-Gum...

182
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,700
--...Pistol!
--Shave!

183
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,620
He disappeared, too!

184
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,630
If your legs are so tremendously strong
that it appears as if you disappeared...

185
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,840
--You bastard!
--Moon Walk.

186
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,010
...you can even kick the air and float.

187
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,520
He's flying! What the...?

188
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,980
And... Tempest Kick.

189
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,190
A slashing attack?!

190
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,690
You two...!

191
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,070
Duck!

192
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,990
Why?!

193
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,630
Luffy!

194
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,210
Did they just cut the wall by kicking?!

195
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,510
That's possible if you can kick fast
enough to cause a gust of sharp wind.

196
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,300
We call it Tempest Kick.

197
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,110
We met on your ship, didn't we, Roronoa?

198
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,410
You aren't a shipwright, then?

199
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,750
Then, could that assessment
of our ship you made be...

200
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,750
Unfortunately... I made the
assessment of the ship seriously.

201
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,800
That's indeed unfortunate.

202
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,560
Luffy!

203
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,070
Don't go, Robin!

204
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,280
We're not done talking yet!

205
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,250
Yes, we are. I'll never see you guys again.

206
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,210
Robin!

207
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,220
Luffy! Hurry up and catch Robin!

208
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,610
Roronoa! You're quite confident,
aren't you, taking your eyes off of me?

209
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,320
Ah! Zoro!

210
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,200
Finger Pistol.

211
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,670
We don't need bullets to
shoot through human bodies.

212
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,840
You...

213
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,050
...bastard...! Let me go!

214
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,010
Luffy got caught so easily!

215
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,970
Go, Nico Robin.

216
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,360
Robin!

217
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,710
Dammit...

218
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,310
Luffy!

219
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,810
Zoro!

220
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,990
How can they be that strong?!

221
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,200
What are you people?

222
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,910
We've lived in a different environment.

223
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,120
Ever since we, CP9 members, can remember,

224
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,800
we've been prepared to risk
our lives for the Government

225
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,470
and trained to surpass the
limits of human abilities.

226
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,510
As a result,

227
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,140
we've mastered the superhuman
techniques called the Six Powers.

228
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,190
I'm sure you've fully learned by now

229
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,610
that the four of us, who have been entrusted
with the World Government's vital tasks,

230
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:06,610
are in a whole different league
from you guys, a mere pirate group.

231
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,250
This is a world-class top secret.

232
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,840
It's not a matter that people
like you can get involved in.

233
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,470
Lucci...

234
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,060
It's about time for the igniters
to go off. We have to hurry, too.

235
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,180
Yeah.

236
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,390
But this is a rare occasion.

237
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,730
Let me show you something
interesting before we go.

238
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,650
--What?
--Th-This is...

239
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,540
Lucci... What the hell are you?

240
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,790
He's huge!

241
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

242
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

243
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

244
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

245
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

246
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

247
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

248
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,090
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

249
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

250
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

251
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

252
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

253
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

254
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

255
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

256
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

257
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,120
Eternally... Eternally...

258
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,460
Whoa! He's huge!

259
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,960
What's with that appearance?!

260
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,760
This is how I really look.
We're done with you guys now.

261
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,300
Straw Hat, can you defeat him?!

262
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,970
He's huge, but I'll beat him up!

263
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,730
Hmph! I'll let you experience
my strongest power!

264
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

265
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,070
"The Straw Hat Pirates Annihilated?
The Menace of the Leopard Model!"

266
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
