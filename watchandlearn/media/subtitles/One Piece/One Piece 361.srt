2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,730
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,990
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,950
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,500
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,090
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,640
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,770
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,570
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,030
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,320
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,290
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,840
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,390
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,980
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,110
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,860
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,410
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,660
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,000
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,050
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,670
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,380
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,090
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,720
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,390
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,060
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,430
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,520
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,900
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,190
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,530
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,700
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,080
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,410
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,750
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,710
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,600
Your trick...!

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,390
Wait! Where do you think you're aiming?!

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,940
That's it!

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,020
Hey, wait!

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,530
Special Attack! Atlas Comet!

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,480
I found it!

53
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,190
That is your real body.

54
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,630
"Perona Is Terrified!!
Usopp and Untruthful Share the Same 'U'!"

55
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,010
I can see you flying around.

56
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,010
You can pass through people and walls!

57
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,650
And you can shrink and grow at will!

58
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,680
That sounds just like a ghost
without a physical body!

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,900
But considering how you fled
from me there for a while...

60
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,780
Don't follow me!

61
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,620
Wait, Horo-Horo Chick!

62
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,370
Don't follow me!

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm sure you still had a
physical body back then.

64
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,330
Wh-What are you--

65
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:39,360
In short, you're a ghost that got
created when I was distracted.

66
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,640
Your real body is tucked
away right over there!

67
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,200
You can't trick me any longer!

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,790
And here I thought you
were just a negative idiot.

69
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,720
Did that mask boost your courage?

70
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm surprised you could
calmly analyze the situation.

71
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
But you're only 90% right.

72
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm not a ghost being controlled by my body!

73
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,430
I can leave my body by having
an out-of-body experience.

74
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,200
This is a sentient Hollow of yours truly!

75
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,700
All righty, then! So what would happen
if you lost a body to return to?

76
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,710
If I go after your body,
my attacks will definitely hit home!

77
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,920
Jerk! Stop it!

78
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,680
Special Attack! Big Bang Star!

79
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,300
That was close!

80
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,940
You missed! And it was a dud to boot.

81
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,520
Here I go again!

82
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,800
I won't let you!

83
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,140
Special Hollow!

84
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,990
Whoa! Is this like the ones from earlier?!

85
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,590
Mini-Hollow...

86
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,310
...Rap!

87
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,000
So this is an "extra-large" version?

88
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,130
Oh, crap! Lemme go, punk!

89
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,090
Struggle all you like! But I won't
let you hurt my physical body.

90
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,920
W-Wait! Hey, whoa! Time out!

91
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,210
The dumpling-sized ones packed a wallop!

92
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,560
My body will get blown to pieces
if this big guy goes off!

93
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,070
You can't touch it even if
you squirm. It's a ghost!

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Gum-Gum...

95
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,850
...Bazooka!

96
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,500
Gum-Gum... Whip!

97
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,820
Ow, ow, ow...

98
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,380
What's the hold-up?

99
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,840
Weren't you going to kick my
butt as many times as it takes?

100
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,720
Yeah! I will in just a sec, so hang tight!

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,810
Well, I don't mind the wait,
but he'll come back if you don't hurry.

102
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,520
"He"? Who are you talking about?

103
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,980
You!

104
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,950
Huh?

105
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,020
Damn it! Where'd it go?

106
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,160
That's weird!

107
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
Nuh-uh!

108
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,630
Hmmm, nope.

109
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,590
I can't find it!

110
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,050
Oh, there it is! Found it!

111
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,230
Just doesn't feel right without this.

112
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,810
I wanna become the rottin'
King of the Pirates!

113
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,620
I know! I should fire a
salute to liven things up!

114
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, that'd be rottin' cool!

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,990
Hey, where are the cannons?

116
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,410
Huh? Well? Gimme a cannon!

117
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,150
Ocho Fleurs!

118
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm Number 1!

119
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
What brute strength!

120
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,820
You still mean to fight back?
You don't know when to give up!

121
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,070
Robin...

122
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,920
Hey,

123
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,500
where do you think you're looking?

124
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,380
Shouldn't you be a bit more nervous,
you stupid reindeer?

125
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,220
Sanji...

126
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,760
Huh? Who're you talkin' about?
Don't make me kill you, punk!

127
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,940
You have no hope of
defeating me, dumb reindeer!

128
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,410
Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

129
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,450
Robin!

130
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,570
Jerk! Watch where you're aiming, moron!

131
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,910
What was that, bastard?!

132
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,300
You're a nuisance the way
you dart around everywhere!

133
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,590
Now!

134
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,130
Now, Robin! Get the salt!

135
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,130
I'm on it!

136
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,160
Oh, jeez. You're such a handful.

137
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,580
Don't! Robin is a lady!

138
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,620
A lady...?

139
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,220
What of it?!

140
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,490
Robin!

141
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,650
Unbelievable! Sanji actually kicked--

142
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,110
It's game over for you.

143
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,960
This fight is over!

144
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,060
Cannon! Cannon! Cannon! Cannon!

145
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:10,870
Cannon! Cannon! Can... Huh?
Why was I searching for cans again?

146
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,320
Huh?

147
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,710
What's this?

148
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,150
What gives? What am I doing out here?

149
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,490
Let's see... I think I'm gonna
become the King of the--

150
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,140
Nope, nope! That's not right.

151
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,040
It's not me who will become
King of the Pirates, but...

152
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,600
That's right. I don't have
time to be goofing off.

153
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,730
I need to hurry back.

154
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:36,430
I must hurry... Hurry back to Master...

155
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,440
I said to freakin' let me go, dammit!

156
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,300
You came so close, Mr. Negative Nose.

157
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,660
With my next signal, your body
will be blown to smithereens.

158
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,190
Don't! Don't! No!

159
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,120
I don't wanna get blown to smithereens!

160
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,070
Don't worry.

161
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,640
I'll be sure to tell
Hogback to use you as a mario.

162
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,630
Kamikaze Rap!

163
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,220
It vanished?!

164
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,670
That was a close call!

165
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,230
The shock from that blast
went inside this shell.

166
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,730
What's going--

167
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,560
I can't move! What is this?

168
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,190
I lied!

169
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,560
You lied?

170
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,730
I lied when I called the first attack
I shot at you the "Big Bang Star."

171
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,320
It wasn't a dud, either.
It was actually my Birdlime Star.

172
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,790
I made sure you couldn't move around
if you returned to your body.

173
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,610
You what?!

174
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,050
Now I can deal with your
physical body and your Hollow!

175
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,460
Crap!

176
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,640
Are you the one who purified Captain Kumacy?!

177
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,850
Perfect timing! Get him,
Lieutenant Gentleman Hippopotamus!

178
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,760
Impact!

179
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,780
W-Was he actually strong?

180
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,160
Youch! My arm's gonna snap!

181
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,450
Gentleman Hippopotamus!

182
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,540
You don't have time to
be worrying about others.

183
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,440
Special Attack! Shining Black Star!

184
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,960
Cockroaches!

185
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,390
Also known as "Cockroach Star"!

186
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,730
They're gross!

187
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,140
Someone, get them off!

188
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,900
Help me! I can't get away!

189
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,640
They're getting in my clothes!

190
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,680
Ew! I hate cockroaches!

191
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,350
I'm scared, Kumacy! Kumacy!

192
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,540
I'm sure cockroaches are scary...

193
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,930
...but you should be more afraid of me!

194
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,390
You've underestimated me.

195
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,550
In the East Blue, I was renowned
for unparalleled brute strength.

196
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,400
T-Ten tons...? W-Whoa, where did
all of that strength come from?

197
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,530
Knock it off! Don't pull
that out when I'm stuck here.

198
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,640
Y-You're gonna kill me! For real!

199
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,800
Get rid of the roaches! And drop the hammer!

200
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,550
Enough with the roaches
and hammer! C'mon, please!

201
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,070
Usopp!

202
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,520
No, stop it!

203
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,650
Stop it, please! I won't go after
your friends! Okay? Sound good?

204
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,670
Please! Please, Usopp-sama!

205
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,130
Golden...

206
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,250
No!

207
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,590
...Pound!

208
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,670
It's pretty lame when the princess
of the haunted mansion...

209
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,180
...passes out over a balloon
and some toy cockroaches!

210
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,190
Gotcha.

211
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,650
You made a big mistake

212
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,150
when you challenged me to a
contest in lying and negativity!

213
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,630
Sleep till dawn!

214
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,580
Wha ha ha! Hee hee hee! Click my heels!

215
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,950
Didn't that samurai just say something?

216
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,010
Long story short, what just happened?

217
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,080
In short, the fight is apparently over.

218
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,640
I've never seen a duel like this before.

219
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,570
That samurai wasn't taking
me the least bit seriously!

220
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,090
You mean to steal my katana?
You are a feisty one.

221
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,390
Let’s see what this "Two-Sword Style,"
or whatever it is, can do.

222
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,770
I am tingling with excitement!

223
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm so excited I could dance!

224
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

225
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,160
"Slashes Dancing on the Rooftop!!
Showdown: Zoro vs. Ryuma!"

226
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,220
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
