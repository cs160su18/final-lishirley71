2
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,830
Isn't it about time for us to settle this matter...

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,170
...as to whether that woman is... foe or friend?

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,090
By the way, why did you put up Nico
Robin's wanted poster in your room?

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,130
Are you curious?

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
A little.

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,680
It's better if you don't know.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,890
She is... a devil.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,690
Tonight, we'll infiltrate Iceberg's
residence one more time.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,320
Among the disciples of this
Tom guy who originally had it,

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,650
Iceberg is the only one currently alive.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,240
No matter how much he plays innocent,

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,410
in the name of CP9, we'll take
it away tonight for sure.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,000
Bear in mind that this is a mission for justice.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,170
If something is to happen,
it'll be tonight. Are we going?

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,460
We are.

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,380
What's our goal?

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,680
We'll capture Robin.

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,390
Otherwise, we won't know anything.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,940
True. Thinking about it is a waste of time.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,400
If we wanna know the truth,
that's the only way.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,480
Okay, I'll do my best, too!

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,400
Well then, let's go...

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,450
...to Galley-La Company!

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,630
Everyone, be on your guard!

26
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,670
Yeah!

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,130
If we allow those pirates to infiltrate
with so many of us on guard,

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,420
it'll be an embarrassment
to Galley-La! Don't let them in!

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,140
Protect Iceberg-san!

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,640
Don't let the assassins get away with this!

31
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,510
What about the back door?

32
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,060
Back door? We're surrounding
the entire main office building!

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,310
There's no blind spot!

34
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,190
Bring it on! We'll take care
of all the Straw Hat Pirates!

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,310
Yeah!

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,740
How is it, Chopper? Does it look
like something is happening?

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,700
For now, nothing.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,910
But...

39
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,500
...they're all carrying weapons,
and they look strong.

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,830
I wouldn't be surprised.
The shipwrights here beat even pirates.

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,880
We should be careful and take
action when the time is right.

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,260
Yeah, if we carelessly plunge in,
we'll be in big trouble.

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Look who's talking! He jumped in
without any plan this afternoon.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,030
Chopper, we don't know what'll happen.
Don't miss even the slightest movement.

45
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,650
Yeah.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,150
If you see any movement,
let us know immediately.

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,700
Yep. Got it.

48
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,080
It's gonna be a long night,
but don't let your guard down.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,620
If we miss our chance tonight,

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,160
we'll have to say goodbye
without knowing what happened.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,380
Think that we won't have a way
to go after Robin anymore.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,000
This is where we find out what we're made of.

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,970
Yeah... We'll definitely capture Robin.

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,100
It's all right! Now let's move forward

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,600
with the sun always in our hearts

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,940
As power passes through our clasped hands

57
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,610
let's grab hold of our wishes

58
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:55,580
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

59
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,930
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

60
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,850
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,980
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,400
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,360
but what you cherish most will be right there

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,370
And if you get into a jam

65
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,450
I'll always be there to protect you

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,540
It's all right! Now let's move forward

67
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,130
with the sun always in our hearts

68
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,130
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

69
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,390
and gaze at the light beyond

70
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,350
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

71
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,600
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
So let's grab hold of our wishes

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,360
under the same flag-- together, we're one

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,030
One Piece

75
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:20,960
"Cannon Fire Is the Signal!
CP9 Goes into Action"

76
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,060
Kalifa...

77
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,850
Yes, Iceberg-san.

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,850
Sorry, but could you step outside for a while?

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,810
Okay.

80
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,320
Also...

81
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,280
...please send Paulie in here.

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,990
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,920
--Paulie...
--Hm?

84
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Iceberg-san says he has something
important to discuss with you.

85
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,590
With me?

86
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,930
Yes, just you.

87
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,060
I'll be in the secretary's office,
so if anything happens, just call me.

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,310
Yeah...

89
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,560
Taking the trouble to have a
talk alone at a time like this...

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,820
What on earth could it be about?

91
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,610
Beats me.

92
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,320
A will?!

93
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,320
She said it was something important.
Get in there and talk to him already.

94
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,540
Y-Yeah...

95
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,330
Shall we stay a little ways away from the door?

96
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,420
Yeah.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,340
I wonder what he needs to talk to Paulie about!

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,220
It's Iceberg-san we're talking about.
It must be very important.

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,970
More importantly, our current
problem is those pirates.

100
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah.

101
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,100
According to Kalifa's investigation,
there're seven of them. Coo coo!

102
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,440
The captain, Straw Hat Luffy.
Pirate hunter Zoro and Nico Robin...

103
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,730
In addition, the young woman who
came to Dock #1 this afternoon

104
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,570
and the round long-nosed guy.

105
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,700
Yeah. There're two others besides those.
That's everyone. Coo coo!

106
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,910
Their purpose is the least of our problems.

107
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,870
When they make their entry here,
that will be the end of them.

108
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,090
We'll bring them all down together. Coo coo!

109
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah!

110
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,760
Okay... understood.

111
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,100
This could be very risky.

112
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,310
I thought about it hard, but you're
the only one I can ask this.

113
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,640
Will you do it for me?

114
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,520
You're acting like I'm a stranger.
Please leave it to me.

115
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,490
You have my gratitude.

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,660
Well then, I'll get on it immediately.

117
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,360
Yeah.

118
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,580
Coo coo... Are you guys done talking?

119
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,370
Yeah.

120
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,340
Something came up. Sorry, but I
have to leave for a bit. Is it okay?

121
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,340
That's fine. The four of us
will be more than enough.

122
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,800
I see.

123
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,220
Watch over Iceberg-san.

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,230
Listen, Paulie.

125
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,200
Right underneath the desk
in the president's office...

126
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,910
If you lift up the carpet, you'll find...

127
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,160
...a safe buried there.

128
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,700
This must be it.

129
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,790
I'll give you the combination, so listen carefully.

130
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,380
First, turn it right to 6...

131
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,930
Click.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,680
Are you ready?

133
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
Yeah, we're ready.

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,230
Then I'll cause a disturbance.

135
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,440
The other four of you, please carry out
your own mission after the signal.

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,940
Understood. In the name of CP9...

137
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,070
Ready? Nico Robin?

138
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,070
Yes... anytime.

139
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,460
An explosion!

140
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,340
What was that explosion?!

141
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,130
Bring water, now!

142
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,220
Take the injured someplace safe!

143
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,300
Hurry! Put out the fire!

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,850
W-Was it cannon fire?

145
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,230
No, it didn't fly in!

146
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,310
It was set up to explode!

147
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,270
Put out the fire! Hurry up and put out the fire!

148
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,570
Someone! Give me a hand!

149
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,150
What a showy signal...

150
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,950
Let's go!

151
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,950
The explosion happened in the
north corner of the first floor!

152
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,960
Is everyone okay?!

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,630
At least half of you stay at your post!
We still haven't seen the enemy!

154
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,630
To prepare for an attack,
strengthen the defenses!

155
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,590
Don't let them come in the building!

156
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,550
Are you okay, Iceberg-san?!

157
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,390
Yeah... I was surprised.

158
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,980
I saw someone!

159
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,810
He's wearing a costume! Catch him!

160
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,310
Here they come!

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,980
Leave them to me!

162
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,440
I'll nail them!

163
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Hey! Wait!

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,610
Geez...

165
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,570
Coo... coo...

166
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,450
This way! Catch him!

167
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,620
Don't let him get away!

168
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,540
He's just by himself! Corner him!

169
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Come on! Assassin pirate!

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,730
He climbed to a higher floor using a whip!

171
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,070
You thought there'd be no one on the rooftop?

172
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,910
Don't underestimate Galley-La's craftsmen.

173
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,870
How dare you mock us by
attempting an assassination?!

174
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,870
Prepare yourself, pirate!

175
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,330
We're definitely not gonna
forgive you bastards!

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,090
You'd better not try anything.
You're no match for me.

177
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,220
There're two here!

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,970
They're headed to the back door!

179
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,730
Don't let them get away!
We'll attack from both sides!

180
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,270
Don't let them inside the building!

181
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,230
Follow them! Capture them immediately!

182
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,490
You have the blueprints of his residence
in your head, right, Nico Robin?

183
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,320
Yes.

184
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Ahh... The craftsmen are in a frenzy.

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,670
Yeah. It's gotten quite noisy.

186
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,380
What do we do? Shall we go in soon?

187
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,590
Hm? Where's Luffy?

188
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,300
Whaaat?!

189
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:34,140
Think thoroughly before you
take action! You dumbass captain!

190
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,980
Are you just realizing that?

191
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,420
The back door! They're headed
to the back door! Corner them!

192
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,500
Don't let them get away! Surround them!

193
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,510
How dare you show your faces
in front of all us guards?!

194
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,010
Don't make light of the craftsmen at Galley-La!

195
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,940
Your fate was already decided
when you hurt Iceberg-san!

196
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Just give up!

197
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,070
You can no longer escape, pirates!

198
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,320
Give up and show your faces!

199
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,780
We're gonna drag out the rest of the
group using you two! Damn assassins!

200
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,000
He's gonna do something!

201
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,590
Shoot them!

202
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,610
They disappeared... No way...!

203
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,820
What's going on?

204
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,700
Where'd they go?

205
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,450
Hey, are you okay?

206
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,380
He's strong... What's with that whip man?

207
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,540
He ran... in the air.

208
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,130
No way...

209
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,800
He ran in the air?

210
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,050
Seriously, you people never listen, do you?

211
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,770
He jumped off!

212
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,730
Moon Walk!

213
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,150
He's doing it again!
He jumped, in the empty air!

214
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,740
Thorny Road!

215
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,130
I told you not to, didn't I?

216
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,540
Ahh! He's coming!

217
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,090
The courtyard! He landed in
the courtyard! Go around behind him!

218
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,470
Hey! He went that way! Go ahead of
him and hem him in from both sides!

219
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,840
Okay!

220
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,390
This must be it.

221
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,430
I see...

222
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,560
So that's the thing
Mr. Iceberg's been hiding, huh?

223
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,020
Give it to us.

224
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,780
You can't appreciate its value.

225
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,290
Who the hell are you bastards?

226
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,870
Where'd you come from?

227
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,580
The darkness.

228
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,500
However, we're a group that carries out justice.

229
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,630
We are Cipher Pol No. 9,
an undercover intelligence agency.

230
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,680
No matter where you slipped in from,

231
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,010
you must've encountered
our craftsmen without fail.

232
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,100
Did we?

233
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,940
We might have... or we might not have...

234
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,940
I don't really remember the details.

235
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,370
This is no longer something as
simple as an assassination, is it?

236
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,660
Well, I don't recall us calling it that.

237
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,290
In any case, please give us that
valuable item of Mr. Iceberg's,

238
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,460
and... since you've learned
something about it...

239
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,970
...we'd like you to die.

240
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,470
In the name of justice...

241
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,140
Right here... right now...

242
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,020
Did you find those two who
disappeared by the back door?!

243
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,440
No! We can't find them anywhere!

244
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,190
What about inside the residence?!

245
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,360
There're guards at every window and door!

246
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,610
There's no way they could infiltrate!

247
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,030
Dammit, pirates! Where'd they go?!

248
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,030
They definitely must be hiding nearby!

249
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,490
Look carefully one more time!
Capture them for sure! Got that?!

250
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,410
Yeah!

251
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,710
He's behind this wall.

252
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,960
Okay. Now, push me.

253
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm shocked.

254
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,640
I knew you'd come sooner or later...

255
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,850
...but I never thought
you'd come through there.

256
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,810
Did you do the same last night?

257
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,570
I know there isn't any door there.

258
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,570
It's the power of the Door-Door Fruit.

259
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,910
No matter how hard the wall is,
the area I touch becomes a door.

260
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,540
As long as there's a wall,
I can go in and out anywhere.

261
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,790
What're you doing? We haven't
gotten the signal yet.

262
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,130
You can't call someone weakened
when he's got enough energy to talk.

263
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,590
Just like a good chef wouldn't neglect
to prepare the ingredients beforehand,

264
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:03,720
pros would be careful to restrain their victim

265
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,520
so that he wouldn't act unexpectedly
before the promised time.

266
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,570
So that's... CP9's way of doing things, huh?

267
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,740
You've got good insight... You're exactly right.

268
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,080
I did a bad turn to Straw Hat...

269
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,960
So, as I suspected, he had
nothing to do with this.

270
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,000
You don't have to feel bad, right?

271
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,050
You just told the truth
that you saw me last night.

272
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,140
That was also part of your plan?

273
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,480
That's right...

274
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,440
We kept you alive so that the crime
would be pinned on the pirates.

275
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,400
Besides, if we killed you suddenly,

276
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,530
we wouldn't know the whereabouts
of what we're after...

277
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,280
The blueprints of a certain ship.

278
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,410
It's something that has
been secretly passed down

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,120
from shipwright to disciple
shipwright for generations.

280
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,670
If you felt your life was in danger,

281
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,090
you'd try to entrust it with someone for sure.

282
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,550
And the one you chose was Paulie,
one of the foremen at Dock #1.

283
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Our fellow members are with him right now.

284
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,230
So everything is going... as you planned, huh?

285
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,030
Make sure things are carried out flawlessly.

286
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,480
Okay.

287
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,450
I'll go deal with the
shipwrights outside the door.

288
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,660
Nico Robin, you finish off this man.

289
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,410
Once those two get the blueprints
from Paulie, they'll contact you.

290
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,380
Kill Iceberg at that time.

291
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,510
Our mission is accomplished once we kill Paulie,

292
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,720
who's come to know the truth.

293
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,600
After that, this crime will be
pinned entirely on the Straw Hats.

294
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,730
Seriously... why can't he
listen to people's advice?!

295
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,740
But that's nothing new.

296
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,030
But... Robin might be in that commotion, right?

297
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,450
What are we gonna do?!
We have to act carefully!

298
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,790
But depending on how you
look at it, we've lucked out.

299
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,500
When Luffy marches into enemy territory,

300
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,710
do you think he'd go around
to the back or the side?!

301
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,920
--Not a chance.
--No chance.

302
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,470
I bet by now he's marched in from the
front by either jumping in or running,

303
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,600
and now he's getting chased around

304
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,680
with no idea where to go, although he made
it inside the residence, don't you think?!

305
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,930
Yeah, sure do.

306
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,940
Yeah, definitely.

307
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,020
Right? From the shipwrights' perspective,

308
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,570
Luffy is the ringleader of the culprit group.

309
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,490
Once he jumps in, I bet everyone's
attention will go to him!

310
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,030
In other words, there's no doubt

311
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,700
that the guard in front of the
residence has lightened up for now!

312
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
So we'll be able to go across that opening

313
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,910
and mix in with the crowd of
shipwrights who're in an uproar!

314
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,880
I see. So thanks to Luffy, the best
chance to infiltrate is right now, huh?

315
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,460
That's convincing! Then, it should
be okay to jump in, huh?

316
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,420
Looks like we can jump over that fence!

317
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,930
Are you guys ready?!

318
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,470
Okay, we're gonna go in!

319
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,640
Follow Luffy!

320
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,780
What part of this is light?!

321
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,580
Dammit... I can't get out.

322
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,160
I wanted to jump into
the building, fast and furious...

323
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,710
...but I'm stuck and can't move!

324
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,790
I can't get out...

325
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,960
I have to hurry...

326
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,090
Just wait... Robin!

327
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

328
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

329
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

330
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

331
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

332
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

333
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

334
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

335
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

336
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

337
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

338
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

339
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

340
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

341
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

342
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

343
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

344
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,670
Nico Robin... I was finally able to see you.

345
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,470
I wonder if we're connected by a thread of fate.

346
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,800
We're alike, so...

347
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,600
What do you mean?

348
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,230
My belongings and your existence
will destroy the world, so...

349
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,560
On the next episode of One Piece!

350
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,230
"CP9 Takes Off Their Masks!
Their Shocking True Faces"

351
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,900
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
