2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,880
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,600
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,280
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,400
In the right corner, hailing from East Blue!

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,320
The leader of a miniscule pirate band
with a 100 million-Berry bounty...

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,370
..."Straw Hat" Monkey D. Luffy!

26
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,630
Wow! The afroed Luffy is all
fired up in the right corner!

27
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,670
Lookin' sharp, Luffy!

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,220
Are you kidding me?

29
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,430
There's the starting bell!

30
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,010
--Let's do it!
--Yeah!

31
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,230
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

32
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,110
Only my fist is slow!

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,490
Nine-Tails Rush!

34
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh...! I wouldn't ride that one if I were you...

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,170
Oh, or that one.

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,800
Told you so!

37
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,240
Luffy...

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,490
Oh, no...!

39
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:57,290
"Full-Blast Slow-Slow Onslaught
vs. Invulnerable Luffy"

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,720
E-Explosions suddenly rock our ship...

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,260
...which just happens to be the battlefield...

42
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,850
Caused by Foxy Face Bombs that
also happened to be loaded...!

43
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,640
Making their ship the battlefield
is such a dirty trick!

44
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,810
--Hey! Luffy! What's going on?!
--Simmer down!

45
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,940
Using this to his advantage, our boss succeeded

46
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,820
in blowing up Straw Hat Luffy
with a cannon attack!

47
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,780
No way! Is Luffy...?!

48
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,000
Is it all over for him?! He's nowhere to be seen!

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
Whew, that was close!

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Indeed, it was a--!

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,130
What?!

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,130
Quit it! You're annoying!

53
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,720
Straw Hat Luffy is... alive!

54
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,680
--Y-You serious?!
--He's mind-boggling!

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,810
He somehow evaded the
close-range cannon barrage!

56
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,610
What speed! I-Is this the true power
of a man worth 100 million?!

57
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,360
--Of course it is!
--Just finish 'im already!

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,840
Oh! But it looks like our boss's
next attack is already underway!

59
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,230
From out of the resulting smoke screen
comes our boss's disturbing laughter!

60
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,390
But where exactly is he?!

61
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,690
What does "Silver Fox" Foxy
have up his sleeve this time?!

62
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,530
--Oh!
--There he is!

63
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,490
Okay, I hope you're ready!

64
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,700
You got blown up?!

65
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,210
I did not! Don't be stupid!

66
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,090
Liar!

67
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't assume for one minute
you'll leave this battlefield alive!

68
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,510
--Slow-Slow Beam--!
--Gum Hook!

69
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,800
No more beams for you!
I'm gonna smash your arms!

70
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,060
He disappeared into the smoke again!

71
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,230
Huh?! There you are!

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,780
--A board?!
--Slow-Slow Beam!

73
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,460
Now, then! Which one is me?
Where will the beam come from?!

74
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,050
Darn it! How should I know?!
They all look like stupid-heads!

75
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,130
Stupid-heads...

76
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,560
There!

77
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,020
And you call yourself a
warm-hearted individual?!

78
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,230
You're in for it now! Look up!

79
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,320
Huh?

80
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,490
Crap! A trap door!

81
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,910
That's what you get for being distracted!

82
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,370
You're the one who told me to look up!

83
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,790
You might wanna pay more attention!

84
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,340
Huh?

85
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,880
Wh-What the...?! Whoa! The floor's moving!

86
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,590
It's dragging me away!

87
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,260
--There's Luffy!
--Why'd he come out of there?!

88
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,270
Oh, no! He'll lose if he falls into the water!

89
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,690
I ain't gonna fall in...!

90
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,520
So close!

91
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,030
Nah, it'd be no fun if it ended so soon!

92
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,490
Hang in there, Straw Hat!

93
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,950
Geez! What's with this ship?!

94
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,950
Where'd you go, fox?!

95
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
What's this?!

96
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,880
A Foxy pin eerily taunts Straw Hat
Luffy after his narrow escape!

97
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,170
In there!

98
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,800
The inside of the ship is our boss's
playground! Will Luffy be lured in?!

99
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,260
No, Luffy! It's totally a trap!

100
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,140
He obviously has a bunch of booby traps set!

101
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,350
That jerk! I'm gonna beat his brains out!

102
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,070
Straw Hat Luffy rushes right in!

103
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,610
The battle has moved inside, but I
can't enter to give the play-by-play!

104
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,320
This is the true essence of this round:
a solitary battle between two combatants!

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,620
Get up! Get up, Luffy!
Remember your painful training!

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,750
Quit playin' around and sit down. I can't see.

107
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,040
Oh, a gun deck!

108
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,710
Man, it's big! I bet Usopp would love this!

109
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,800
Now where is he?!

110
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,550
There he is!

111
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,100
All right! He's coming after me...!

112
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,610
Now he'll bust through
the door at breakneck speed!

113
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,530
Little does he know...

114
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,320
...that this room is filled with spikes!

115
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,160
Now rush in and get--

116
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh. There he is.

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,260
Whoa, what's with that room?

118
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,760
Who fires cannons inside other
people's ships?! Seriously!

119
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,980
Oh. It's coming back.

120
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,440
You have some nerve!
Are you trying to kill me?!

121
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,900
Dammit!

122
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,860
I'll show you!

123
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,820
Oh! He's running away!

124
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,780
"Infirmary"

125
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,780
Get back here!

126
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,250
Does this brat have any common sense?!

127
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,670
That's it! Foxy Face Transformation!

128
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,880
Stop right there, fox!

129
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,340
--A person?
--Dear me!

130
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,050
Whatever's the matter? Do you feel sick?

131
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,220
Where are you sick? The head?
Are you sick in the head?

132
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,390
H-Huh?! Did anyone just come in here?

133
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,190
No, I didn't see anyone. But never mind that...

134
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,190
What's wrong with you? Your face?

135
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,860
That's weird... I'm sure I saw him--

136
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,530
Hold on! That woman looked like him!

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,120
Could it be?!

138
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,080
Hey, you! You're that guy's sister, aren't you?!

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,750
Counter Fox Blow!

140
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,710
Fool!

141
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,340
What is this thing?!

142
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,390
That's weird! He really was in this room!

143
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,400
Is he even trying to fight?!

144
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,020
Oh! The kitchen!

145
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,650
Fish, fish! Cut it up, sour it up! Carpaccio!

146
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,570
Grill up a sole, fa-mi-re-do!

147
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,410
Oh? Can I help you?

148
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,420
Have you seen a fox with its head split
in two who looks like a real moron?!

149
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,380
That's going too far...!

150
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,420
It's you!

151
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,050
I was the lady in the infirmary, too!

152
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,970
That thing, too?!

153
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,930
Slow-Slow Beam!

154
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,390
Oh... no...

155
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,350
Nine-Tails Rush!

156
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,270
Don't think I lured you
in here without a reason.

157
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,700
Go check out what's waiting
for you when you get sent flying!

158
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,660
It ain't a living creature.

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,080
That'd be against the rules, after all.

160
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,980
While a Slow-Slow Beam
is in effect, any impacts given

161
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,150
are stored up and then go off all at once.

162
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,070
Go on, now! Your life's final stop lies ahead!

163
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,790
30 seconds are up.

164
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,060
Huh? Where is he?

165
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,970
I'm... right here!

166
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,070
Feh-feh-feh-feh-feh!

167
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,240
And another feh!

168
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,790
What's with that outfit?!

169
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,210
I am Pilot Foxy! And...

170
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,840
...let me introduce you
to the Gorilla Puncher 13!

171
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,880
A gorilla-like punching machine

172
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,220
that's had every single flaw ironed
out through constant improvement!

173
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,840
Is the gorilla face really necessary?!

174
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,980
Excellent point!

175
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,650
I mean, shut up! Who asked you?!

176
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,150
Go, Gorilla Puncher 13!

177
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,490
How is it moving on its own?

178
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,120
It's a secret...!

179
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,160
You're sure sweatin' a lot...

180
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,960
Shut up!

181
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,050
You think you can dodge these
measly punches, don'tcha?

182
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,920
Slow-Slow Beam!

183
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,510
What? Where are you aiming--?

184
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,760
Take a look behind you!

185
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,430
Huh? Who's that?! A mirror?!

186
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,770
Yes! Mirrors reflect Slowmo Photons!

187
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,850
Got ya!

188
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,240
Ouch! Ouch!

189
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,330
Oh, that hurt? Too hot for you?

190
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,750
I forgot to mention that this
thing's punches are flaming hot!

191
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,120
Better watch out! Not even Sea Kings
can withstand a beating from this!

192
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,500
Mirror Racket!

193
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,570
We're just getting started!

194
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,780
Slowpoke Ball Demon Coach! A two-sided
attack with bouncing beams and punches!

195
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,500
Oh! So that's why the beams
didn't work on that fishman!

196
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,880
Man, this is irritating!
If I can just get close to him...!

197
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,970
Keep running! You'll end up squished
between the gorilla and the mirror!

198
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,680
That's it!

199
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,400
I never thought of that!

200
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,280
What?!

201
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,530
Gum-Gum Pistol!

202
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,410
Got him!

203
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,170
Slow-Slow Beam! Beam! Beam!

204
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,630
Fool!

205
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,010
Gorilla Punch Golden Hits!

206
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,910
Round #3 of this second Davy Back Fight--
the combat round-- is underway!

207
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,000
What's happening now is
anyone's guess, but there's no doubt

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,120
a truly epic battle is
taking place inside the ship!

209
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,040
Boss! Boss! Boss!...

210
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,050
Despite not being able to see him,
the crowd cheers for our boss!

211
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,420
He ain't gonna lose!

212
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,720
Of course not! He's Luffy! And he has a 'fro!

213
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,050
Being Luffy is more than enough.

214
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,600
That damn fox...

215
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,020
What's so special about an afro?
Does it power you up or something?!

216
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,150
This is taking longer than usual...

217
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,150
Well, the guy is made of rubber.

218
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,030
He's made of rubber and has a 'fro!

219
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,780
Seriously, what's that
have to do with anything?!

220
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,950
Luffy will win us back...!

221
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,740
Yes. He does have that afro and all.

222
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,210
Not you too, Robin...!

223
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,960
Oh, my! There's activity on the deck!

224
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,130
Who has the upper hand?!
Or could the fight be over now?!

225
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,140
I see two figures!

226
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,230
Our boss is the one still standing!

227
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,440
Boss!

228
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,950
Meanwhile, Straw Hat is charred black!

229
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,830
He seems to have taken some
seriously heavy punches!

230
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,540
Luffy!

231
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,670
That's impossible...

232
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,040
How could some simple punches
burn him?! What did he do?!

233
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,420
Luffy!

234
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,420
Look!

235
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,230
Straw Hat Luffy is up!

236
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,730
Just when it seemed he was down
for the count, he got back up!

237
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,160
Looks like you barely
pulled through, Straw Hat...

238
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,540
It's the brotherly soul! Afro power!

239
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,040
Kick his butt, Boss!

240
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,130
Take this!

241
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,850
This is the Slow-Slow Beam Sword!

242
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,730
I've restrained your arms and legs!
But feel free to move anything else!

243
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,360
Not that you can, though.

244
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,650
Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!

245
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,660
Rush! Rush!

246
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,120
Rush!

247
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Rush! Rush!

248
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,290
Rush!

249
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,050
Rush! Rush!

250
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,130
Rush!

251
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,970
30 seconds.

252
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,180
He's down for sure this time-- No, wait!

253
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,600
Luffy!

254
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,530
Straw Hat Luffy is up!

255
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,820
Whoa! Who is this guy?!

256
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,990
It's gotta be the 'fro! Is it the afro's wildness?!

257
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,460
Stubborn little...!

258
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,000
Take this! Slow-Slow Beam!

259
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,380
Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!

260
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,100
Dammit, that's not fair!
That beam's against the rules!

261
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,850
Usopp!

262
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,060
Whoa! This looks like the end...!

263
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,080
Dealing the punches ain't so easy, either!

264
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,040
He's beating him to death out there!

265
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,500
Oh?! Again...?!

266
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,050
A-Again...?!

267
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,470
Luffy...!

268
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,520
I won't...

269
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,310
...let you have...

270
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,820
...a single member of my crew...

271
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,700
...even if it costs me my life!

272
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,080
Luffy...

273
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,050
Straw... Straw Hat Luffy
is on his feet once again!

274
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

275
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

276
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,620
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

277
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

278
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

279
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

280
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

281
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,880
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

282
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

283
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

284
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

285
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

286
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

287
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

288
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

289
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

290
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,540
Eternally... Eternally...

291
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,340
He's unsteady and out of breath,
yet he stands with a glimmer in his eye!

292
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,350
Now this is a Davy Back Fight!
I'm so teary-eyed I can't see straight!

293
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,760
--Luffy!
--Luffy! Luffy!

294
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,480
Don't cheer on the enemy!

295
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,940
Boss! Boss!

296
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

297
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,190
"Epic, Heated Combat!
The Fateful Final Conclusion"

298
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,730
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
