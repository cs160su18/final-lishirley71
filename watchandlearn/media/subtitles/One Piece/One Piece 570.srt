00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320

One, two, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:07,420
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,810
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,290
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,000
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,990
where they instigated an all-out war
against the New Fish-Man Pirates,

78
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,410
who were holding a grudge against humans
and looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom.

79
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,250
Luffy finally defeated Hordy, the captain of
the New Fish-Man Pirates, in a fierce fight

80
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,630
and thwarted his plot.

81
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,930
2 years ago at a Sky Island,

82
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,970
I read a Poneglyph indicating where
one of the ancient weapons is.

83
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,050
The Mermaid Princess who lived
around the same time as Joy Boy...

84
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,310
...was known by a specific name, wasn't she?

85
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,500
The ancient weapon...

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,810
...Poseidon!

87
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,740
"The Straw Hats Stunned! The
New Fleet Admiral of the Navy!"

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,420
I do not know their purpose

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,640
but a long time ago, there were powerful
entities that could destroy the world.

90
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,790
They were 3 Ancient Weapons
given the names of gods.

91
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,400
Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon.

92
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,940
And she is one of them.

93
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,150
Indeed.

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,870
We can't let anyone know about this.

95
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,040
Every powerful group in the world would
want Princess Shirahoshi's power.

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,120
The Government--even pirates.

97
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,500
The Ancient Weapons?

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,820
They could destroy the world?!

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,510
I got all their treasure
and I was about to leave

100
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,640
but this is even bigger news!

101
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,620
I see. So that Mermaid Princess is...

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,950
Whew, I want seconds!

103
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,910
You already ate it all?!

104
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,120
It's so good--I could eat this forever!

105
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,210
Especially this candy!

106
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,920
It's as good as meat. I
want hundreds of them!

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,100
I-I'm afraid we are running out of that one.

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,390
We can bring other things if you want!

109
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,350
All right!

110
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,080
Let me ask you, Luffy.

111
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,780
What do you know about the
state of the world now?

112
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,770
Huh? What are you asking all of a sudden?

113
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,080
Looks like you know nothing. You're
out of the loop--that's not good.

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,370
Yeah?

115
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,290
Here's the food!

116
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,430
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

117
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,170
Okay. One sec.

118
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,210
I'll take a light snack.

119
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,890
Oh, you guys are here too!

120
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,690
I drank too much! I'm trying to sober up!

121
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,860
I ate too much!

122
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,210
Sanji Mermaid-ed too much.

123
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,130
It's like heaven! The Mermaid Island!

124
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,500
What?! Akainu and Aokiji had a big fight?!

125
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,860
That's what I thought.

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,530
You didn't even know about that, did you?

127
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,090
I didn't hear about anything
during my training.

128
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,130
Rayleigh is terrible.

129
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,210
I knew about it! I knew!

130
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,300
Are you serious?!

131
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:44,280
Right after the war 2 years ago,
Fleet Admiral Sengoku resigned.

132
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,300
Sengoku recommended Aokiji

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,910
to be his successor since he was
very popular among his own men

134
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,000
but a lot of people at the
highest level favored Akainu

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,280
and so he became a major contender.

136
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,840
Normally, Aokiji doesn't show his passion

137
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,260
but he hated the idea of Akainu
becoming a Fleet Admiral.

138
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,600
They stood against each other and the
first-ever feud between the Admirals...

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,220
...erupted into a battle
on an island somewhere.

140
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,570
Like the saying "Dead men tell no tales,"

141
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,770
whoever lost had to withdraw his candidacy.

142
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,570
The winner would lead the Navy.

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,160
As all the world now knows, their
deadly struggle lasted for 10 days.

144
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,410
They were comparable in their
strength but it came to an end.

145
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,920
Akainu won!

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,670
Sakazuki is the new Fleet Admiral.

147
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,010
Akainu!

148
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,650
I got you!

149
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,350
Did Aokiji die?

150
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,600
They were both severely wounded

151
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,160
and though Akainu is
pitiless, he showed mercy

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,190
to his former comrade
who couldn't even stand.

153
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,340
But Aokiji refused to work for Akainu

154
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,010
so he left the Navy.

155
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,050
He's not a Navy soldier now, is he?

156
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,080
No, he is not. I wonder where he
is and what he is thinking now.

157
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,460
It was a big loss for the Government, too.

158
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,940
Of course. The Admirals were
the Navy's greatest powers.

159
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,450
But what the Government
did to cover their loss...

160
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,270
...gave the Navy unexpected power.

161
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,140
Listen. You all need to know
the two biggest changes...

162
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,830
...which have occurred in the New World.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,770
First, the Navy Headquarters
led by Sakazuki...

164
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,220
...has become an even more
powerful force for justice.

165
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,420
And second,

166
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,720
the Blackbeard Pirates have advanced.

167
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,440
Blackbeard?

168
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,640
We met them in Mock Town.

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,620
They destroyed my hometown once.

170
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
The new era they're talking about is crap!

171
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,470
The era where pirates have dreams
will be over, they say?! Huh?!

172
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,200
What's going on?

173
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,830
People's dreams... have no end!!

174
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,830
Isn't that right?!

175
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,290
So you're...

176
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,070
...Blackbeard?!

177
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh yeah, I never gave you my name.

178
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,890
Long time no see, Straw Hat!

179
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,730
He was once a long-time member
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

180
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,350
He knows their territory very well

181
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,360
and he conquered it in an instant
after the good old man died.

182
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,850
Using the Tremor-Tremor Fruit power
that he got from the good old man.

183
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,080
The world already counts him among...

184
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,370
..."Red-Haired," Kaido,

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,940
and Big Mam,

186
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,840
and considers him as one
of the Four Emperors.

187
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,870
So he took Whitebeard's place successfully.

188
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,740
What a dirty rat!

189
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,720
Yes, he is annoying.

190
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,110
Rumor has it that they are  on
the hunt for Devil Fruit eaters.

191
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:56,190
They can somehow acquire a Devil Fruit
eater's power after killing them.

192
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,130
They keep looking for
stronger Devil Fruit powers.

193
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,570
Be careful!

194
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,980
They'll get me!

195
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,920
No one wants your Human-Human Fruit power.

196
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,980
What?!

197
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,960
Especially you, Luffy-kun.

198
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,340
There is a lot of bad blood between
you and Blackbeard--Teach.

199
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,710
So take extra care...

200
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,560
Luffy! Are you even listening?!

201
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,700
I thought you were the captain!

202
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,310
You have to know a little
bit of information at least!

203
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,920
Don't worry, Jimbei.

204
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,150
We were listening.

205
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,400
I thought captains normally
don't listen to other people!

206
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,910
Captains are responsible for their
crew's safety, aren't they, Luffy?!

207
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,090
Hey Jimbei, take it easy! I
like taking chances anyway!

208
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,570
It must be hard to work for him.

209
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,300
Yeah...

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,880
Luffy-chin!

211
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,010
There you are!

212
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,770
You shouldn't be here. You're
the life of the banquet.

213
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,270
Camie!

214
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,250
I haven't seen Yowahoshi.

215
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,180
Princess-sama said she's
tired and she wanted to rest

216
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,670
so she went to her room.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,450
Hey, Zoro!

218
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,840
Sanji!

219
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,540
I think there is a wild animal
or something in this palace.

220
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,300
You're right.

221
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,050
I feel it, too.

222
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,470
THE HARD SHELL TOWER

223
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:56,180
I did not know it's such fun
to party with everybody!

224
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,250
Help!

225
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,080
Shhh!

226
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,260
Please stop! Who are you?!

227
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,550
Somebody! Help!

228
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,940
Don't look so resentful, Princess-san!

229
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,270
Don't worry! I'm not gonna
hurt you or make you suffer!

230
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,240
I was content with taking the treasure.

231
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,860
It became a pain to sell those Mermaids

232
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,370
but you're an exception!

233
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,410
I just need you to be
unconscious for a while!

234
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,240
I just got word from my
brother and the others

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,430
they've arrived at a port on this island!

236
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,780
Come to the New World with us!

237
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,590
Hey.

238
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,560
Come on! Why don't you laugh?

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,470
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, boo!

240
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,100
Hey!

241
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,060
What do you want, Straw Hat?
I'm having fun here so go away!

242
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,990
Nyah, nyah!

243
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,700
Nyah, nyah, nyah! Nyah, nyah, nyah... Nya...

244
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,490
What?

245
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,280
Straw Hat?!

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,370
Luffy-sama!

247
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,670
I didn't know he was still around.

248
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,010
Luffy-sama!

249
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,100
It was scary!

250
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,050
You're so lucky, Luffy!
I should have kicked him!

251
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,520
He was the pirate that
we captured in the sea.

252
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,760
I haven't seen him since we
entered the Fish-Man Island.

253
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,780
I forgot about him.

254
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,150
That was close! Thank you again!

255
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,710
Don't mention it!

256
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,100
I can't believe the treasure
thief was still here.

257
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,690
We usually don't even let
a tiny fish into the palace

258
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,300
but the gate was left open in
the confusion of the battles.

259
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,150
Look! That tower on the right
has been sliced clean through.

260
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,770
I assume the thief did it
while we were not here.

261
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,650
No, this guy cut the tower.

262
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,560
When they escaped from the cage,
he cut bars, walls... everything!

263
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,380
Why did you have to tell him
that, you stupid starfish?!

264
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,440
What?! As they say, lying and
stealing are next-door neighbors!

265
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,940
Wait a minute, Minister of the Right-chan!

266
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,360
Chan?

267
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,400
Did you say "treasure thief"?

268
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Yes, he stole all the
treasures in the palace.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,490
What?! He did?!

270
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,160
I have a bad feeling!

271
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,920
Aren't they national treasures?
You're not gonna go after him?

272
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,650
After seeing my people's lives be
saved, treasures mean nothing to me.

273
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,710
No, they're worth something!

274
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,350
What if we get them back?!

275
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,920
You can keep them all.

276
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,060
It would be wonderful if people who
saved the country had them-jamon.

277
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,770
Are you sure?!

278
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,300
You fools! Why did you kick him out?!

279
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,430
Why didn't you just punch
him and tie him up here!

280
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,940
I love it even when you...

281
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,150
Go find him now!

282
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,950
K-King-sama!

283
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,910
Something wrong with Hordy and
the others! Their cuffs came off!

284
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,750
What?!

285
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,710
THE PRISON TOWER

286
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,260
Damn humans! Our grudge against
you will never go away...

287
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,930
Our time to avenge will come again...

288
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,890
Bring Straw Hat here! I'll kill him!

289
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,400
Am I drunk?

290
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,870
I feel pain in my joints!

291
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,130
I got old on purpose.

292
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,680
I'll get back at the Straw Hats-fosun...

293
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,060
We are the ones who will punish humans.

294
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,210
What is going on here?

295
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,900
Is that Hordy and his clan?

296
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:41,300
Don't think that you can keep me
in jail, you stupid royal family!

297
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,120
Th-These bars are nothing...

298
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,370
Captain Hordy!

299
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,590
What is going on here?!

300
00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,530
I knew it! The Energy Steroid
that you guys were taking...

301
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,300
...was the legendary pill that
was kept in the Tamate Box!

302
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,500
Tamate Box?

303
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,970
It was national treasure that had been
passed down for generations-jamon.

304
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,440
10 years ago, somebody stole
the contents of the Tamate Box.

305
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,720
We couldn't find who did it
and by the King's decision,

306
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,130
we closed the case before
it became a scandal.

307
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,700
Come to think of it, that was
when you left the army, Hordy.

308
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,020
That's right! I stole it!

309
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,840
You idiots!

310
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,760
The legendary pill had unclear effects.

311
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,690
One explanation says it
gives you tremendous power.

312
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,560
Another explanation says
it just makes you old.

313
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,950
It is an odd national treasure.

314
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,920
I assumed they guarded the power drug closely

315
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,900
in order to seal off its dangerous effect.

316
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,220
You folk opened the box
that should not be opened

317
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,500
and dreamed a foolish dream
of gaining some power-jamon.

318
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,800
Shut up, Neptune!

319
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,220
Seems like they no longer get their revenge.

320
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Shut up!

321
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,510
We're chosen avengers!

322
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,700
We will kill all humans...

323
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,480
...and you!!

324
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,700
I feel sorry for them now.

325
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,860
I will consider giving them clemency.

326
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,110
Wait, Neptune!

327
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,080
Fukaboshi, you're a dishonor to our race!

328
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,130
The Fish-Man Island will change.

329
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,050
You killed my mother but I will
not hold a grudge against you.

330
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,840
So please. Just shut your mouth!

331
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,900
I don't want the children
on the island to hear you.

332
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,390
Minister of the Left!

333
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,660
Mr. Pekoms and Baron Tamago
arrived at the Candy Factory!

334
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,910
They were sent by Big Mam.
This is not a good time!

335
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,880
Where are our sweets? Grr!

336
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,670
Mama is waiting for them-soir!

337
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,780
We don't have any sweets
to pay them for this month.

338
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,790
Hordy and the others destroyed the factory

339
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,510
and the undamaged sweets have

340
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,330
been sent to the banquet
since everybody wanted the

341
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,790
Straw Hats to have them!

342
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,350
I wonder if we can explain the situation.

343
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,830
She is like a monster who would
destroy a whole country for sweets!

344
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,990
One of the Four Emperors...

345
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Big Mam!

346
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,730
Luffy and the others are caught up trying
to reclaim the treasure of Fish-Man Island.

347
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,800
The crew of Big Mam, one of
the Four Emperors, shows up.

348
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,750
Just as Fish-Man Island faces
destruction yet again...

349
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,890
...at the hands of one of the
overwhelmingly powerful Four Emperors...

350
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,640
...Luffy takes a stand!

351
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,310
On the next episode of One Piece!

352
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,030
"She Loves Sweets! Big Mam
of the Four Emperors!"

353
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
