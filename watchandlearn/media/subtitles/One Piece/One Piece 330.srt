1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'll we save Luffy?!

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
Edited at https://subtitletools.com

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,450
Travel across the oceans of the world

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,830
Bellow a battle cry

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,630
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

6
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,350
We've left the established course

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,770
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,150
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,530
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,500
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

11
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,960
Travel across the oceans of the world

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,210
Bellow a battle cry

13
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,970
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

14
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,560
"That feeling" I get when embarking

15
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,060
Is something I hope to remember always

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,530
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,780
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

18
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,830
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,420
While laughing out loud

21
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,800
As we dash by like a noisy party

22
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,350
Make some waves...

23
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,560
Life is "Adventurous"

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,100
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

25
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,810
Who's gonna be "One of us"

26
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,440
And a trip goes on because

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

28
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,940
To the West, To the East

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,280
Gotta find my way, Sail away

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
All the way to "One piece"!!

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,570
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,910
And spread your wings

33
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,290
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

34
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,620
Let's press forward

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,670
Snatch up the treasure here and there

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,090
While laughing out loud

37
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,470
As we dash by like a noisy party

38
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,180
Make some waves...

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,850
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

41
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

42
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,300
The words he uttered just before his death

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,040
My treasure?

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,530
If you want it, you can have it!

46
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,670
Find it!

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,830
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

48
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,210
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,690
On their way to the New World,
the Straw Hat Pirates

51
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,450
were confronted by the
Accino Family bounty hunters.

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,010
Coup de...

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,990
...Burst!

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,460
The Straw Hat Crew dodged the Accino Family

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,890
and managed to get the Sunny
outside of the Arctic Path once,

56
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,250
only to lose their Jolly Roger,
the embodiment of their pirate souls.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,580
And the flapping Jolly...

58
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,120
It's gone!

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,460
Our Jolly Roger is gone?

60
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,250
The secret behind the
Arctic Path's moving icebergs

61
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,390
were the peculiar Savage Penguins.

62
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,750
D'oh!

63
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,980
Crap!

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Now that the Straw Hat Pirates
have been split up,

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,700
the Accino Family is swooping
in to claim their heads.

66
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,780
Let's play, Miss!

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,830
Your luck bites.

68
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,960
I am Blend-sama, the second
son in the Accino Family!

69
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,400
"Desperate Battles for the Straw Hat Crew!
Pinning Their Pirate Souls on the Flag"

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,770
"Lovely Land"?

71
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,720
Love...?

72
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,750
That's right!

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,880
Your flag is in Lovely Land!

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,160
The Accino Family's base of operations
is none other than Lovely Land!

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,410
Where do you see cuffed pirates smile
as they're handed to the Marines?

76
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,410
That's right!

77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,370
Lovely Land!

78
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,750
Whoa!

79
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't care about that!

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,340
I was still in the middle of my explanation.

81
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,760
Wait!

82
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,590
Luffy!

83
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,910
Oomph!

84
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,880
Oh, well.

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,460
You caught me off guard a second ago--whoa!

86
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,400
But that won't happen again.

87
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,600
Hey, raccoon!

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm not a raccoon!

89
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,860
Your captain isn't too bright, is he?

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,550
It's no wonder you lost
your precious Jolly Roger!

91
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,680
Hey, ex-pirates!

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,500
Get ready for the worst!

93
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,080
You're going to see Hell,
all because you covered

94
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,410
for that pathetic excuse of a captain.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,920
If you dilly-dally, who knows what
will happen to the flag we stole?

96
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,170
Gum-Gum...

97
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,930
Gatling!

98
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,790
Crap!

99
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,480
I figured I'd let him attack me until
he wore himself out and screwed up...

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,920
...but he isn't showing any openings!

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,690
In fact, his openings are getting smaller!

102
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,620
You have a cute ship!

103
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,820
What was the name?

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,450
It's the Thousand Sunny.

105
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,960
Thousand...?

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,380
No, I meant your name.

107
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,630
My name?

108
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,450
I am Robin.

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,630
Nico Robin.

110
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,460
Nico Robin?

111
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,070
Right.

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,130
Didn't I see you earlier?

113
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,450
You recognize me?

114
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,450
Of course!

115
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,510
I was surprised when you
showed up so suddenly.

116
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,310
Say, Lil, do you know where
the rest of the crew is?

117
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,860
The Thousand's crew?

118
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,980
I don't know!

119
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,080
I see...

120
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,890
But I know where your flag went!

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,070
Aren't you searching for it?

122
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,700
Yes.

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
Where is it?

124
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,100
Could you tell me?

125
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,300
Will you...

126
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,710
play with me?

127
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,390
Huh?

128
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,260
What was that?

129
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,570
Will you play with me?

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,990
I'll tell you if you do.

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,840
All right, I'll play.

132
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,590
Really?

133
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,350
Yay!

134
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,470
My big sister hasn't been
playing with me lately.

135
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,280
She's always playing with him.

136
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,040
She's always with that creepy guy.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,030
Nice!

138
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,390
This is really nice!

139
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,980
Yes, Salchow!

140
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,910
We're looking truly terrific!

141
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,400
What is with these two?

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,540
It's not like they're launching an attack!

143
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,540
They're just circling around us
over and over and over again!

144
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,000
All righty!

145
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,130
Jump and kick!

146
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,650
Arbell, the rink today...

147
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,620
is perfect for... skating on!

148
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,010
Darn him!

149
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,140
Jump and kick!

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,110
You're right, Salchow!

151
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,640
I think... we're going to
get... some good skating in!

152
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,860
They aren't gonna let us
up and leave, are they?

153
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,880
Hey, Sanji!

154
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,550
Yeah?

155
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,670
Don't we need to hurry back to the Sunny?

156
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,570
Yeah...

157
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,500
Then do something about these two!

158
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,990
La-la!

159
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,850
Arbell-chan, that's sexy!

160
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,950
So sexy!

161
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,940
That's right...

162
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,000
You're super easy on the eyes!

163
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,000
This is just how he is...

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,700
You're super sassy!

165
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,700
...all the time!

166
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,060
Darn it!

167
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,940
Hey, punks!

168
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,410
You're the ones who stole
our flag, aren't you?

169
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,800
Arbell, you're nice even on the rink!

170
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,390
Where did you put that flag?!

171
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,810
Really nice!

172
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,810
Listen to me!

173
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,660
La la-la la!

174
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,940
What is with this couple?

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,820
I bet Papa-san would be tickled pink

176
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,590
if we finished these two off
and brought back their heads.

177
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,110
Definitely, Salchow!

178
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,430
I'm sure he would be!

179
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,570
I'd say that was enough for our warm-ups.

180
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,270
O-Our heads?!

181
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,200
S-So they really are...

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,910
It's show time!

183
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,660
Love Throw!

184
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,410
Arbe--

185
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,970
Damn it!

186
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,260
Once more!

187
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,930
Love Throw!

188
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,550
The lady is flying into my chest!

189
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,230
D... Damn it...!

190
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,640
I can't believe he sent a lady flying...!

191
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,610
What a vile thing to do!

192
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,510
It's the guy from earlier...

193
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,270
Yeah.

194
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,960
You're the guy who stole
our Jolly Roger, aren't you?

195
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,950
Huh?

196
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,460
Your Jolly Roger got stolen?

197
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,070
Who coulda done that?

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,140
It wasn't you?

199
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,570
Then let's go!

200
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,750
We're wasting our time.

201
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,420
Yeah.

202
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,740
I swear, this place is too cold!

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,450
W-Wait!

204
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,440
Timeout!

205
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,210
Don't quit the game!

206
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,500
Y-You were right!

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,870
M-My Family stole your flag.

208
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,020
Where is it?

209
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,260
The location?

210
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,130
Where, indeed?

211
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,360
If you don't know, we're leaving!

212
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,510
W-W-Wait!

213
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,900
Timeout!

214
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,970
Don't go!

215
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,270
Don't go just yet!

216
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,400
I actually do know where your flag is.

217
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,200
Then where is it?!

218
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,660
Er, where was it again?

219
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,870
We're gettin' nowhere fast!

220
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,430
Timeout!

221
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:50,730
Timeout!

222
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,770
Timeout!

223
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,630
I didn't know you had projectiles!

224
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,400
That isn't how real men fight!

225
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,490
You shoulda played nice and told me
you packed that stuff from the start!

226
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,130
It's too cold for this!

227
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,360
Please send him flying already!

228
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,220
Sure thing!

229
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,060
Let the game begin!

230
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,900
If it's my projectiles versus yours,
I'm not gonna lose!

231
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,140
Tch!

232
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,360
This defeats the point of my winter outfit!

233
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,240
Damn it!

234
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,410
Crap!

235
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,620
I'm starting to lose visibility.

236
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,080
I thought he was just goofing off,

237
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,780
but I'll never get anywhere if
I can't see where I'm shooting!

238
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,210
And the cold is starting to numb my movement.

239
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,720
I need to finish this fast!

240
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,460
It looks like you're struggling!

241
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,130
You're wasting your time if
you can't see your target!

242
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,930
Now eat this!

243
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,690
You can't see me!

244
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
Tsk!

245
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,350
I don't have time to play with an idiot!

246
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,610
Y-You found me...?

247
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,680
Yeah!

248
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120
Long time no see.

249
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,730
Now, which hand is the coin in?

250
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,090
Hmm, give me a second.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,660
This one!

252
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,930
Hmph!

253
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,020
Say, Lil?

254
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,090
What?

255
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,140
Where is our flag?

256
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,850
I don't know!

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,150
Please!

258
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,350
Won't you tell me?

259
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,000
But I don't know!

260
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,080
Okay, okay!

261
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,510
I'll tell you!

262
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,850
I'll tell you where it is!

263
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,530
Really?

264
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,120
Really!

265
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,140
Honest!

266
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,010
All of our flags are in Papa's room.

267
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,930
Your Papa?

268
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,820
Right!

269
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,970
He has a whole bunch!

270
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,170
His room is covered with Jolly Rogers!

271
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,100
It's filled with them?

272
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,580
Today is his birthday, so everyone
came to pick up a birthday present!

273
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,930
Was the flag the present?

274
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,970
Boo!

275
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,850
Bad guess!

276
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,430
These are the presents.

277
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,100
This person has a 300-million-Berry bounty.

278
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,760
This one has a 120-million-Berry bounty.

279
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,340
This one has a 44-million-Berry bounty.

280
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,070
And then...

281
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,870
...you have an 80-million-Berry
bounty, right?

282
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,580
Gum-Gum...

283
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,700
Pistol!

284
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

285
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,960
Is your flag all that important?

286
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,680
Of course it is!

287
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,500
That flag represents our pride!

288
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,880
It's more important than anything else!

289
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,910
Gum-Gum...

290
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,300
Battle Axe!

291
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,130
Careful there!

292
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,890
That means nothing to a raccoon like you.

293
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,350
We're talking pirate talk right now.

294
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,390
Shut up!

295
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,830
I am a pirate!

296
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,050
Don't think you'll get off lightly for this!

297
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,330
What could a raccoon possibly hope to do?

298
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,150
Shut up!

299
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,570
Whoa!

300
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,910
Aren't you the feisty one?

301
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,020
What was that?!

302
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,830
I don't mind if you take me down,
but what will you do about your flag?

303
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,710
If you take me out, who will
guide you to Lovely Land?

304
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:27,970
Luffy!

305
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,640
No worries there!

306
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,370
I'll ask for directions after I whack you!

307
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,120
I suppose a 300-million-Berry bounty
won't go down without a fight...

308
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,170
It'd be safest if I threw in the towel for now
and finished them off at Lovely Land.

309
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,690
All right!

310
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,970
You win!

311
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,840
Just give me a--

312
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,050
Give back my Jolly Roger!

313
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,890
You bastard!

314
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,260
W-Wait!

315
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,790
I give!

316
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,850
I surrender!

317
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,170
I'm raising the white flag!

318
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,690
Actually, I have your flag right here.

319
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,490
I'll hand it over now...!

320
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,200
Luffy!

321
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,910
Give our Jolly Roger back!

322
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,070
Ah, crap!

323
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,730
Luffy!

324
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,770
I can't believe you fell for it!

325
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,130
I dare you to come after me
if you want the real flag back!

326
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,040
As for you ex-pirates!

327
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,730
You'd better prepare yourselves!

328
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,380
Puzzle-san?

329
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,270
Puzzle!

330
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,510
Luffy!

331
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,910
Love Throw!

332
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,620
They're the ones who stole our Jolly Roger.

333
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,750
I'm sure of it!

334
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,790
You've incurred the wrath of the almighty
Usopp-sama, you stupid doting couple!

335
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,010
Special Attack: Flame Star!

336
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,300
Bull's eye!

337
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,090
Arbell!

338
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,100
Arbell!

339
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, Arbell!

340
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,900
This is what happens to the fools
who damage a pirate's pride!

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,730
Arbell!

342
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,820
How dare you hurt my partner?!

343
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,620
We were really in the groove!

344
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm gonna break your nose!

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,290
I'm sorry!

346
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,310
L-Luffy!

347
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,250
Luffy fell into the ocean!

348
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,250
Was it all for their Jolly Roger...?

349
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,370
Why would he do that if he couldn't swim...?

350
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:11,960
Luffy!

351
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,940
No, you don't!

352
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,260
Doctor, you can't swim either!

353
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,720
Now that you mention it...!

354
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,920
S-Stupid!

355
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,650
How are we supposed to set
sail without the Jolly Roger?

356
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,570
Everyone, go look for it!

357
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,940
Yeah!

358
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,550
Hey, it's about time you put that back.

359
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,160
They're in an uproar, claiming that
the Jolly Roger "went missing."

360
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,430
Yeah!

361
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,990
I'm going to become the King of the
Pirates under this Jolly Roger!

362
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm tired of hearing that,
but I have to agree.

363
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,960
That's what makes you the captain!

364
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,420
I don't think anyone can defeat us!

365
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,990
I-It's the Phoenix's Jolly Roger!

366
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,080
Dang, that was pathetic!

367
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,570
If you're gonna run from a fight,
you should give up being pirates!

368
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,210
Don't be so harsh.

369
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,190
It just goes to show how powerful
this Jolly Roger has grown.

370
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah!

371
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,230
Luffy!

372
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,290
Thank goodness!

373
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,290
Luffy-san...

374
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,110
Luffy!

375
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,830
I'm so glad you're okay!

376
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,040
It's great!

377
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm so happy!

378
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,370
Here you are.

379
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,530
You still haven't caught them?

380
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,150
How is the Straw Hats' flag coming?

381
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,930
It should be here soon, Papa.

382
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,900
Please calm down.

383
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,800
Huh?

384
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,680
I am calm!

385
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,480
Really?

386
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,740
I'm glad to hear it.

387
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,260
Well, they say that you enjoy things more
if you have to wait for them, Papa.

388
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,850
Huh?

389
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,640
Did someone pass by just now?

390
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,920
No, I didn't notice anyone.

391
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,440
Have you had too much to drink?

392
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,190
I don't know...

393
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,000
At any rate, hurry up with the flag!

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,760
Uh-huh.

395
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll see how it's coming along.

396
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,240
Hey!

397
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,620
Yes?

398
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,780
Also check on Straw Hat.

399
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,810
Certainly, Papa.

400
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,710
Where am I?

401
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,170
The best part of a game is the brawl!

402
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,270
A brawl?

403
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,020
I'm good at those, too.

404
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,770
Coup de Vent!

405
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,410
Game set...!

406
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,160
Super!

407
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,040
Oh?

408
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,880
And right when I ran outta cola!

409
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,580
What's with this place?

410
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,840
It's too cold!

411
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,380
It's kinda cramped in here, huh?

412
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,480
Sorry.

413
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,130
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

414
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,120
I wanted to lend you a hand
and tried pressing some buttons,

415
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,100
but nothing would turn on and it's cold...

416
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,850
What's wrong with it?

417
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,420
Jeez!

418
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,770
That pounding won't stop and
the temperature keeps dropping!

419
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,490
This isn't funny!

420
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,610
Pounding?

421
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,620
Uh-huh!

422
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,990
It couldn't be...!

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,670
I caught them alive!

424
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,580
Never let your guard down!

425
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,760
Click.

426
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
Huh?

427
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,990
What was that?

428
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,690
Uh-huh.

429
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,180
Uh-huh.

430
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,350
Two?

431
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,580
Oh, is that right?

432
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,450
Uh-huh.

433
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,240
Okay.

434
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,140
You got it.

435
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,250
Go, my kites, Uo!

436
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,680
Now then, let's resume our game.

437
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,780
What happened?

438
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,050
My third oldest brother
caught two of the bounties.

439
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,940
It was her and him.

440
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,280
C'mon, c'mon!

441
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,380
Hurry!

442
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,590
Let's play!

443
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,720
R-Right.

444
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,350
Why don't we play some more at your house?

445
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,520
Huh?

446
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,380
You'll come to my house to play?

447
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,960
Will you invite me over?

448
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,820
Sure!

449
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,980
Damn it!

450
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,020
Wh-What's going on?!

451
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,540
Why are there two of the same guy?

452
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,660
Wow!

453
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,260
Is he a Devil Fruit power holder?!

454
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
It's a clone technique!

455
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,970
That's so cool!

456
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,890
Hey, Chopper!

457
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,970
Let's give it a try.

458
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,770
Sure!

459
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,100
I've got no objections!

460
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,260
But how do we do it?

461
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

462
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,940
"Stifling to the Max!
The Twins' Magnetic Power Looms"

463
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
