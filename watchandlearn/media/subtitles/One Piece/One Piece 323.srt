00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,930
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,770
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,230
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,390
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,360
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,560
Ah! Zoro! Sanji!

35
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,560
We've got trouble!

36
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,110
Your grandpa is back, Luffy!

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,560
They're at the opposite seashore.

38
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,270
They're looking for us now!
They're going to attack us!

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,240
What?! Why?! I thought he said
he wasn't gonna capture us.

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,110
How would we know?!
Hurry up and get ready to set sail!

41
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,790
I'm giving this back!

42
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,460
Now, come on board, Franky...

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,840
Board my ship.

44
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,890
Don't be so cocky!

45
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,220
You guys are total amateurs who
could only manage makeshift repairs!

46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,850
It'd be a pity for such a magnificent ship
not to have a shipwright on board.

47
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,980
I guess I don't have much choice
but to help you guys out!

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,240
I, Franky, will be the shipwright on your ship!

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,620
"Departing the City of Water!
Usopp Mans Up and Brings Closure to the Duel!"

50
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,070
Vice Admiral Garp!

51
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,830
Hm?

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,080
We've found the Straw Hats!

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,550
They're on the scrap heap island at
the southeast seashore, about to set sail!

54
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,580
We're gonna head there right away!
Get on board immediately!

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,510
Yes, sir!

56
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,980
"Navy"

57
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,230
Vice Admiral Garp! We lightheartedly
parted with Luffy-san and the others.

58
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,070
This is quite embarrassing!

59
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,700
If you wanna complain, talk to Sengoku!

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,160
He's the one who chewed me out
and made me come back here!

61
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,120
How bossy of him.

62
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,620
That's because you said,

63
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,870
"It's my grandson, so..."
on the transponder snail.

64
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,840
Shut up! Mind your own
business, you greenhorn.

65
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,280
A-Admiral, what about you?
Is it okay for you to be here?

66
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,800
It's a lot of work going back by bike.
Well, don't worry. I won't do anything.

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,980
Er... I think that also can be a
problem when facing our enemy.

68
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,720
Set sail!

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,900
Bro! Take good care of yourself!

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,910
The Franky Family will live on forever!

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,370
Straw Hats! You guys take care, too!

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,140
Hey, Luffy!

73
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,580
Luffy!

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,040
Are you really sure you don't have to
wait for one more person, Straw Hat?

75
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,510
I did wait. Ever since I heard what Sanji told us,

76
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,450
I tried so that our room at
Galley-La wouldn't be empty.

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,390
What? Usopp is coming back?!

78
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah. He was by himself rehearsing
how he'd rejoin us at the seashore.

79
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,030
Really?! So he really wants to come back.

80
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,440
Then let's go get him right away!

81
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,710
Yeah!

82
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,790
He's always gotta do things the hard way.

83
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,000
Usopp is coming back!

84
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,000
Hold it, you guys!

85
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,380
I won't allow any of us to go get him.

86
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,720
What? Why?

87
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,640
Whatever you do, don't assume a
subservient attitude towards him, Luffy.

88
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,810
Zoro...

89
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm not gonna accept him
until he apologizes first.

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,400
--Zoro! Why?!
--Hey! Who are you to decide...

91
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,270
Shut up!

92
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,850
No matter what feelings were involved
in Luffy and Usopp's first argument,

93
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,280
or no matter who the right one is...

94
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,330
...once a man decides to fight a duel,

95
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,160
the outcome of the duel decides that argument.

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,200
It's true that the ship
belongs to you, the captain.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,590
So fight me...

98
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,690
If I win, I'll take the Merry.

99
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,100
Monkey D. Luffy!

100
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,100
Fight a duel with me!

101
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,060
He lost...

102
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,400
...and walked out on us on his own.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,320
Now, listen, you guys. He might be
an idiot, but he's still our captain.

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,880
If Usopp can't treat him with
respect when things are critical,

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,030
we're better off not having him in our gang.

106
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,540
If a captain stops commanding respect,
his gang will fall apart without fail.

107
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,800
Listen! I don't care if you
want to act happy-go-lucky,

108
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,260
but if you, the man who is above me,
ever shows weakness,

109
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,220
next time, the one leaving the gang will be me!

110
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,470
What?!

111
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,430
Hey, that won't solve anything!

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,400
It's good that that idiot
now wants to come back.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
But...

114
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,740
...if he tries to fudge on this issue
without taking any responsibility,

115
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,700
I won't accept that no matter what!

116
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,350
If that happens, we'll leave him on this island.

117
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,910
What?

118
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,020
Hold on, Zoro. It's true that
his actions weren't appropriate,

119
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,830
but we can give him a good
talking-to once he comes ba...

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,840
Is leaving the gang such a trivial matter?!

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,510
No.

122
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,710
But...

123
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,350
Nami-san.

124
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,250
Unfortunately, this time,
what he's saying is correct.

125
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,010
There's no way we can trust a man
who'd do such a thing on impulse.

126
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,830
Here is what it boils down to.

127
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,410
If the first words coming from Usopp are
a sincere apology, then we're all good.

128
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,620
Otherwise, there's no place
here for him to come back to.

129
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,580
We're not little kids playing pirates.

130
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,760
Do what you want with the Merry.

131
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,810
We'll get a new ship and
move on to the seas ahead!

132
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,240
Well then, bye, Usopp...

133
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,260
It's been fun.

134
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,240
You're right.

135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,130
We went our separate ways.

136
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,840
We still have several days before the
ship gets completed and we set sail.

137
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,250
Let's just stay here and wait for him.

138
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,690
I waited for him there all this time,
but he didn't come.

139
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,550
That's his answer.

140
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
Straw Hat...

141
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm sure... he'll have a fun life, too.

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,150
He probably won't quit being a pirate,
so I hope I'll see him some day on the sea!

143
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,530
All right! I'm gonna go back to my friends!

144
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,500
We've got a magnificent ship!
They're all waiting for me!

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,240
The question is, how will I rejoin them naturally?

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,840
Well, no matter how they act,
I've got 100 strategies!

147
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,300
The strong candidate for my first
words has to be these, after all.

148
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,450
"If you're begging me so
much that you're in tears,

149
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,210
I suppose I can come back if
you make me Vice Captain."

150
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,810
"Thank you, Vice Captain Usopp! Yay!"

151
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,020
"We'll do whatever you tell us, so please
come back." They might say that!

152
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm so good!

153
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,990
I'm the very example of a man who
turns even his mistakes to good use!

154
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,450
In this adverse situation, I'll further
endear myself to them and live happily.

155
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,410
Okay! I'd better hurry up!

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,750
I'd love to stay, but goodbye,
Water Seven, the City of Water!

157
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,980
Usopp...

158
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,680
Luffy, let's wait a little longer.
We're not in a rush or anything.

159
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,760
Hey, Luffy!

160
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,810
What was that?!

161
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,610
Dammit! They found us! It's the Navy!

162
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,370
Grandpa?!

163
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,890
It's Vice Admiral Garp's battleship!

164
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,040
Bro! Straw Hat! Get out of here!

165
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,920
Hey, Luffy! Can you hear me?!

166
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,380
This is Grandpa! This is Grandpa!
If you can hear me, say something!

167
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,780
Hey, Grandpa! What're you doing?!

168
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,840
You said you weren't gonna capture us here!

169
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,950
Well, the thing is, a lot
has happened since then.

170
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,310
Sorry, but I'm gonna send you
to the bottom of the sea!

171
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,140
What?!

172
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,220
Well, I'm not doing this as an
apology for that or anything,

173
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,220
but I'll fight your gang all by myself!

174
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,480
Give me a cannonball.

175
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,440
H-Here you go, sir.

176
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,860
What's he trying to do?

177
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,330
Meteor... Fist!

178
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,640
Whoa! H-He fired a cannonball
with his bare hand!

179
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,600
That came flying at us with more
power than the ones fired by cannon!

180
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,220
It's not like he was just throwing a baseball!

181
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,850
My power's been declining lately.

182
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,030
We have no choice!
We're getting out of here for now!

183
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,690
Or our new ship will be blasted to bits!

184
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,880
Bring 1,000 cannonballs to me!

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes, sir!

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,740
Hurry!

187
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,500
This isn't good! A whole bunch of those
things are about to come flying at us!

188
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,350
Meteor Fist Shower!

189
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,600
Oh, boy... Against that,
no ship would stand a chance.

190
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,020
Now, let's get started, shall we, lads?

191
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,980
Don't think that you can
run from me! Be prepared!

192
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,000
Full speed ahead!
We'll take care of the cannonballs!

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,650
Got it!

194
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,990
Dammit! Is he really not coming?

195
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,020
What's he doing?

196
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,840
He's here!

197
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,420
Usopp's here!

198
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,290
Hey, everyone! Usopp's here!

199
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,430
Really?

200
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,680
Yep!

201
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,260
Out of my way! Out of my way!

202
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,470
S-Sorry! L-Let me through!

203
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,930
Hey, nose guy! What're you doing here?!

204
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,720
What?

205
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,450
Wh-What's going on?

206
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,570
Why are they setting sail
just because the Navy's here?

207
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,320
I just assumed that you were on the ship.

208
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,490
What're you guys doing?! I'm still right here!

209
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,520
Why? Why? Why?!

210
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,970
When we fought together
even after our argument?!

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,980
Sogeking.

212
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,830
Hm?

213
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,250
Shoot through that flag.

214
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,630
Roger.

215
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,800
This is my new weapon,
a huge slingshot... named Kabuto!

216
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,760
Have a good look at its power!

217
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,180
Special Attack... Firebird Star!

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,060
--Hm?
--That's...

219
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,790
Snap!

220
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,080
You are a sword!

221
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,110
Someone get me a lawyer!

222
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,670
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

223
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,630
I'm the one who fought outstandingly
as that king of snipers, Sogeking!

224
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,140
You gave up on me because I disappeared?!

225
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,390
Wait!

226
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,520
Hey! The stairs are broken! Be careful!

227
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,230
What's wrong?! Hey!

228
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey! Guys! No more worries!

229
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm back for you guys!

230
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,940
You jerks...

231
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,510
Stop...!

232
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,350
Gum-Gum... Balloon!

233
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,830
Usopp's coming, Luffy! Usopp's coming!

234
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,910
Protect the ship!

235
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,460
Hey! Rejoice! It's me!

236
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,370
Chopper! It's a fine day today! Let's go fishing!

237
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,220
Well, I guess this is no time for that, huh?!

238
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,890
Oh, yeah, I've got good news!

239
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,980
Believe it or not, when I'm back,

240
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,440
I don't mind becoming your Vice Captain!
What do you think? Well?!

241
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,220
Hey, Luffy! Guys!

242
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,440
I know!

243
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,950
You guys're crying with joy over there, right?!

244
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,660
Hey, you are, aren't you?!

245
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,670
Luffy! I can't go along with you anymore.

246
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,920
Sorry to cause you trouble until the end.

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,340
Don't tell me you actually
believed that joke I made!

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,300
We've been friends for so long!

249
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,480
There's no way I'd say
something like that seriously!

250
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,810
Although we said all sorts of things
to each other, we're friends!

251
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,310
I'll let these little things go!

252
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,640
Now, hey!

253
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,350
Say something!

254
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,740
Enough already, you jerks!

255
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,090
Luffy! Usopp's talking to us!

256
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,130
I can't hear it.

257
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,600
Zoro!

258
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
I can't hear anything!

259
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,430
That's a lie! I know you can hear it!

260
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,280
Stop... joking.

261
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,490
So that's how it is.

262
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,270
So you really are trying to part with me?

263
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,700
I see... Fine, then.

264
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,460
Listen, Luffy! It's not like everyone
can live looking ahead like you do!

265
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,880
I can't just leave our wounded friend
here and move on to the seas ahead!

266
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,760
Go ahead and cut off useless friends
one after another and move on.

267
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,720
I've been thinking about this for a while.

268
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,770
To be honest,

269
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,030
I've been thinking that I can't keep
up with your monstrous strength.

270
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,180
You don't need weak friends, right?

271
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,000
Luffy... you're the man
who'll be king of the pirates.

272
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,620
But I don't have to go that high up.

273
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,540
Thinking back, when I was about to sail out,
you guys asked me to join you.

274
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,010
That's all that's tying us together.

275
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,990
We don't have to travel together
when we have a difference of opinion!

276
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,700
If that's what you want...

277
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,320
...let me say one last thing. You guys...

278
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,270
Where I'm going is my own business.

279
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,850
It has nothing to do with you guys anymore.

280
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm...

281
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,330
...leaving the gang.

282
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm sorry!

283
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,820
I'm sorry for being bullheaded!

284
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,600
I was wrong!

285
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,360
Usopp!

286
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,320
I know I'm being pathetic.
I know I said I was leaving the gang.

287
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,790
But... is there any chance
that I can take that back?!

288
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,100
Can I?!

289
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Please!

290
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,100
Please let me...

291
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,840
...stay with you!

292
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,350
One more time...

293
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,020
...let me join you guys!

294
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,030
Luffy...

295
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,400
You idiot! Grab my hand already!

296
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,680
You're the one who's an idiot!

297
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,640
You guys are so lame!

298
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,860
Everyone's finally on board!

299
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,550
We're gonna hurry up and get
through this cannonball attack

300
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,720
so that we can get on with our adventure, guys!

301
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,750
Yeah!

302
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,670
Say, Chopper. We finally have a bounty, too.

303
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Like I said, I can't accept that!

304
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,990
50...? 50...?

305
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,020
Nojiko, Gen-san, and everyone
in Cocoyashi Village...

306
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,690
I wonder how they'll feel when they see this...

307
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,880
On the next episode of One Piece!

308
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,820
"Wanted Posters Make It Around the World!
Celebration in Their Hometowns

309
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,940
as the Ship Moves Forward!"

310
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,590
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
