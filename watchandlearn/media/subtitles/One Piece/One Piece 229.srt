2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,920
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,670
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,950
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:10,090
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,190
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,700
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,410
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,710
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,090
One Piece

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
A-A frog is doing the front crawl!

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
What?!

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,440
It went to your side, so take a look at it!

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,200
--Is that true?
--Hey, Luffy...

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,490
Are you taking what that
stupid Admiral said seriously?

28
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,580
To start with, there's no way a frog
would do the front cra... Hey, it is!

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,080
A-A frog is doing the front crawl!

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,250
We'll follow it, guys!

31
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,130
Yeah!

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,590
Why is there a lighthouse in a place
like that? I wonder if someone's there...

33
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,850
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!...

34
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,310
It flew!

35
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,220
All right! The frog stopped. Corner it at once!

36
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,230
We ran ashore on something!

37
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,730
What's this sound?

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,250
Ow, ow, ow...

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,920
Go back! Go back! Turn 180 degrees!

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,890
"The Dashing Sea Train and
the City of Water, Water Seven"

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,930
What the hell is that?!

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,480
Just turn around! Now!

43
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,590
What the hell is this?!

44
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,180
Wh-Wh-What the hell is this lump of iron?!

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
A ship?

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,970
No! Something shaped like
this can't travel on the sea!

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,980
Hey, frog! Run! What're you doing?!

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
Ahhh! It got run over!

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,930
The ship was puffing out smoke!

50
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,950
Pirates...?

51
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,740
Grandma! Grandma! Pirates are here!

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,290
What?! Is that true, Chimney?!

53
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,710
Okay then, bring the Transponder Snail to me!

54
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,370
Okay!

55
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,540
This is a problem.
Someone came out of the building.

56
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,460
They're gonna call for help.

57
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,340
Here it is, Grandma!

58
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,630
Err... Hello?

59
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,890
Let's see... What was it? I forget.

60
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,890
So she's drunk?!

61
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,780
Oh? Paille, huh? It goes good with alcohol.

62
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,780
Whoa! This is good!

63
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,860
I'm Chimney. This is our cat, Gonbe...

64
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,320
...and Grandma Kokoro.

65
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,240
You guys aren't train robbers, are you?

66
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm Luffy. I'm the man
who'll be King of the Pirates.

67
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,370
--Really?!
--Yeah.

68
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,340
What a funny guy.

69
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,170
Say, Chimney, that thing is a steamship, right?

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,970
But with a shape like that,
it can't go on a voyage.

71
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,840
You've never seen something
like that, have you?

72
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,100
Even if you look all over the world,
this is the only place you can find it.

73
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,890
It's a sea train called the "Puffing Tom."

74
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,270
Puffing Tom?

75
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,560
It turns paddlewheels using a steam
engine and runs on the sea railway.

76
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,360
Railway?

77
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,030
That's right. It runs a little
below the surface of the sea.

78
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,410
The train travels the same route every day,

79
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,620
taking passengers from one island to another.

80
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,500
It carries ships and the mail as well.

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
She's right. There really is a railway.

82
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Then we ran ashore on that, huh?

83
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,130
That's right! There's both
a signal and a partition.

84
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,710
It's dangerous to come inside like that!

85
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,470
But the signal should face the other way.
Otherwise, how do we see it?!

86
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,720
Even if it's dangerous, that guy
wouldn't understand, right?

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,180
It wasn't nice to send him flying.
We were after him, you know.

88
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,980
What? "That guy"? Are you
talking about Yokozuna?

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Yep, that front crawl frog.

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,190
Yokozuna wouldn't die from that.

91
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,360
He's the source of all our
headaches at this shift station.

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,030
He loves strength contests and
always tries to defeat the sea train.

93
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,450
He'll show up again.

94
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Strength contests? Oh...
That's why he didn't run, huh?

95
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,040
He's sure got guts.

96
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,460
Give me a break! We're having problems!

97
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,500
The rail guard was broken many times, too!

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,010
Every time he shows up, it causes
the passengers a lot of trouble!

99
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,220
I see...

100
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,010
Okay, then! I'm not gonna eat him!

101
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,970
I'm not gonna eat a fighter!

102
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,520
You shouldn't have thought about
eating a frog in the first place!

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,140
So where do you guys wanna go?

104
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,060
If you're gonna take the sea train from here...

105
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,490
The town of the Spring Queen, St. Poplar...
The gourmet town, Pucci...

106
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,200
The Carnival town, San Faldo...
They're all fun places.

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,910
If you work for the Government,
there's a separate, special train.

108
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,250
The gourmet town, Pucci?

109
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,960
Oh, I see...

110
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,590
That's the place the guys we met on the
uninhabited island were talking about.

111
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,630
Oh... Come to think of it...

112
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,260
Then, we'll pick the gourmet town.

113
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,310
Obviously not!

114
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,060
Since we've got our own ship,
we won't take the train.

115
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,270
We'll just follow the log.

116
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,400
Oh...? Where is it pointing?

117
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,150
East of here.

118
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,240
I see. Then it must be Water Seven.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,070
The train you saw earlier came
from that island's Blue Station.

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,370
It's called the "City of Water." It's a nice place.

121
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,450
Water Seven?

122
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,670
Above all, it's a city that made
a name for itself with its shipyard.

123
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,710
Their technology is No. 1 in the world!

124
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,840
The ships they build are the World
Government's favorites! Isn't that amazing?!

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,680
I see... Then there's gotta be
some amazing shipwrights, right?!

126
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,810
Not just "some"! It's a hangout
for the world's best shipwrights!

127
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,930
Usopp!

128
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,980
Yeah!

129
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,640
All right! I've decided!

130
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,770
We're gonna go there and get a
shipwright to join our crew for sure!

131
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,730
Oh, is that right? Then hold on a sec.

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,440
Oof.

133
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,530
--What's that about?
--Beats me.

134
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,910
Well, then... Here's a simple map
of the island and a reference letter.

135
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,210
Give this to a guy named Iceberg
and ask him to fix your ship good.

136
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,290
Water Seven is a big place. Don't get lost.

137
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,260
--Whoa!
--Kokoro-san! You have a big heart!
What a nice person you are!

138
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,510
We're gonna go back to Water Seven soon, too.

139
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,940
Yeah. If I see you guys again, I'll treat
you to a drink at my favorite bar.

140
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,480
Okay. I hope we'll see you guys again!

141
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,490
It'll take about a week for the log to
be stored in Water Seven. Take it easy.

142
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,870
Yeah! Thanks!

143
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,750
All right, guys! Get ready to set sail!

144
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,790
--Yeah!
--Well then, we'll get going!

145
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,920
Thanks for all your help, Kokoro-san! Chimney!

146
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,510
Be careful!

147
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,350
Watch out for the Government people!

148
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,270
Yahoo! Let's go! To the city of meat! Yahoo!

149
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,980
Were you even listening?

150
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,460
Hmm... What a nice wind!

151
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,960
We may be able to get to the city
of water sooner than expected.

152
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,050
I hope so.

153
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,640
Luffy, leave the shipwright search to me.
I'll find an incredibly pretty woman.

154
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,600
Are you an idiot?! It's a
shipwright we're talking about!

155
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,100
It's gotta be a big guy like
a mountain! Five meters tall!

156
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,730
But if he's too big, we don't know
if he could live okay on this ship.

157
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,480
All that matters is that he's skilled, right?

158
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,530
More importantly, the question
is if we could find someone

159
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,690
crazy enough to want to be on a pirate ship.

160
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm looking forward to it.
We're gonna have another new friend!

161
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,540
We were lucky to stop at the station first,
since they drew a map for us.

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,370
If we go to the place on the map
and visit the Iceberg guy...

163
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,580
"Around here" "Water Seven"

164
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,580
I see...

165
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,210
Ha! Too simple to figure out!

166
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,710
Whoa! This is like Luffy's drawing.

167
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,920
"Shipwright
5 meters"

168
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,920
So, we're gonna all look for a guy like this.

169
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,550
If there was a guy like that, I'd run.

170
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,050
Yeah, me, too. If I had a boat,
I'd escape to the sea.

171
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,010
But this guy seems to be related to octopuses.

172
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,600
He might follow me to the sea.

173
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
What the hell are you guys running on about?!

174
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,150
Well then, guys, come here!

175
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,060
I'll give you some allowance for
the week we're gonna stay there.

176
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,610
Seriously?! Yaay! I'm first!

177
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,480
Whoa! That's generous!

178
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,150
Hey! Stand in line!

179
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,910
Allowance! Allowance! Allowance!

180
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,000
What's the matter, Usopp?

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,970
This tinplate patchwork brings back
memories of battles and adventure.

182
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm filled with deep emotions when I
think that she will be repaired soon.

183
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,850
--I do understand that, but...
--Hm...?

184
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,020
...especially since we entered the Grand Line, our journey has taken quite a toll on the Merry.

185
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,650
The deck squeaks and the leakage at
the bottom of the ship is bad as well.

186
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,150
If we don't do anything, both we
and the ship will be in danger.

187
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,450
Yeah, but we've got tons of money now.

188
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,660
We can have her repaired perfectly.
We can power her up, too!

189
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,240
All right! Let's get more cannons!

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,500
Then, let's get a bronze statue on board, too!

191
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,330
Hey, isn't that the one?

192
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,960
Hm?

193
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,130
The island! We can see the island!

194
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,550
Okay, guys! Paddle!

195
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,180
We've got enough wind.
Don't make us waste our energy!

196
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,110
How wonderful...

197
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,940
Amazing...!

198
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,280
What the hell is this?!

199
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,000
What a huge fountain!

200
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,170
Amazing! This is indeed an industrial city!

201
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,630
It's no surprise that this
place would have a sea train.

202
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,220
Wow... This is a lot of water!

203
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,140
Where is that water springing out from?

204
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,520
How interesting... It looks like
the water comes from the fountain,

205
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,980
goes through the canals and falls into the sea.

206
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,360
Hey, do you wanna race on those water slides?

207
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,530
Race?

208
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,620
No! There's no way I'm doing that!

209
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,330
Dream on, you idiot. You can't even swim.

210
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,420
Oh, yeah...

211
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,210
More importantly,
what do those numbers mean?

212
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,920
Huh...?

213
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,840
--Don't know.
--Are they walls? Or...

214
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,680
"Shipwright
5 meters"

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,720
I bet those are the entrances
for the five-meter shipwrights.

216
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,680
There's a bunch of them?!

217
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,930
The one up front must be the station.

218
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,730
It says Blue Station.

219
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,060
I wonder where the harbor is.

220
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,270
It must be in the town.

221
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,530
--Hey, you guys!
--Hm?

222
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,240
It's not good for you pirates
to be openly sailing in the front!

223
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Go around to the backstreets over there!

224
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,540
Okay! Thanks!

225
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,050
Whoa, this is amazing! A city on the water?!

226
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,920
Wow! This place is cool! What a beautiful city!

227
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,230
But the city is flooded.
The houses are submerged in the sea.

228
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,690
That's not it. The city was designed
with the base being submerged.

229
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,650
--Huh?
--Look at the foundation
underneath the buildings.

230
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,860
You're right! The pillars are built higher!

231
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,490
I see... That's why it's called
the city of water, huh?

232
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,450
Hey, hurry up and dock the ship!

233
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,330
Hm?

234
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,250
Hey, hey, you guys!
Pirate ships shouldn't come in here!

235
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
What'd you come here for?! To plunder?!

236
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,630
No! We wanna get our ship repaired!

237
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,720
Would people normally ask
if we're here to plunder?

238
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,970
Then, there's a cape ahead of here,
so anchor your ship there for now!

239
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,310
Okay!

240
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,060
Thanks!

241
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,480
Again?

242
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,310
It can't be helped, right? We're pirates, after all.

243
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,320
This area should be okay, don't you think?

244
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,780
In any case, what a dull place this is.

245
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,530
All right, then! Furl the sail!

246
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,500
What're you doing?!

247
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,630
Nothing! I just pulled the rope!

248
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,300
Holy crap! The Going Merry
has gotten this rickety?

249
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,140
By the way, why aren't the people
on this island scared of pirates?

250
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,640
Probably because pirates are just
another customer to their shipyard.

251
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,900
Stop talking and fix it already!

252
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,280
Maybe because they have
bodyguards strong enough

253
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,360
to deal with pirates who cause a ruckus?

254
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,570
They probably do...
considering the size of the city.

255
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,530
Really?! Hey, what're we gonna do? This is bad.

256
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,750
Why would it be bad? We're customers.

257
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,910
Y-You think so?

258
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,660
Okay, then! See you later!

259
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,040
Wait, Luffy! Usopp!

260
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,420
You guys, come with me.

261
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,170
Hm?

262
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,090
To where?

263
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,180
First, we'll take the reference
letter from Kokoro-san

264
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,760
and go find the man named Iceberg.

265
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,720
We'll ask him to help us
arrange the ship's repair.

266
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,850
We also have to find a place
where we can cash in our gold.

267
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:31,690
I see... All right, then! Anyway,
let's go! To the city of water!

268
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,740
You're forgetting the gold.

269
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Ah...

270
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,370
Zoro! Make sure you fix it good!

271
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,910
Be careful, Nami-san!

272
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,040
Ahh... I somehow missed
the chance to go with them.

273
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,540
Let's go out together later.

274
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,420
Really?! I wonder if they have a bookstore.

275
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm sure they do.

276
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,680
Why don't we go to the
money-changing shop first?

277
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,550
Why? Let's go to the shipyard.

278
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,770
But we can't walk around the island
with this much gold. I get nervous.

279
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,230
Even after changing it to money,
the value is the same.

280
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,150
It's true, but it being this big will
attract people's attention, right?

281
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,780
What if we run into bad thieves?

282
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,440
We're the thieves!

283
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,820
He's got a point. If we change it
to bills, we can all carry them.

284
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,910
Hm? Your remark had a sting to it.

285
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,330
It sounds like me carrying it is a problem!

286
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,790
Yeah. You might drop it somewhere or lose it.

287
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,750
Yeah, he would. It's Luffy we're talking about.

288
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,960
What?! You guys! Don't you trust me?!

289
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,460
--Nope!
--Ah... Ahh... Ahh... That really hurt!

290
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,260
I may not be able to recover from thi-- Hm?

291
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,560
Is this the only entrance to the city?

292
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,390
A rental bull shop?

293
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,180
What's that?

294
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
What do they rent out?

295
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,060
What's "bull"?

296
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,770
Beats me. Bulldogs?

297
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,020
Can't be, right?

298
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,650
Excuse me! Please let us rent bulls!

299
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,280
Ask what they are first!

300
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,450
Welcome! You wanna rent bulls, right?
How many are you?

301
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,580
Three!

302
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,910
What kind of bulls would you like?

303
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,410
There're three ranks.
"Yagara," "Rabuka," and "King."

304
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,670
Well, for the three of you,
two Yagaras would probably do.

305
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,590
Okay! Please roast them nice and tasty!

306
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,050
Weird! That conversation is weird!

307
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,550
Oh? You followed logs to get here?

308
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,800
--Yep.
--That's quite an achievement, you guys.

309
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,760
Then you had no idea what bulls were, did you?

310
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,470
--Right.
--Well, to make a long
story short, those are bulls.

311
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,020
They're Yagara bulls.
They're everywhere in town.

312
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
In this area, there's a fish called
Yagara that swims with its head out.

313
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,030
This is the city of water.
There're more canals than walkways.

314
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,610
So bulls are a means of transportation
necessary to the residents here.

315
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,830
It's the same when you go
sightseeing on this island.

316
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,080
That fish is pulling a boat?

317
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,040
Rather than pulling, they're letting
people ride on their back.

318
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,710
Well, it's like horseback riding
or riding in a carriage on land...

319
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,670
Oof.

320
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,720
You see the fish pen there?
Well, try and ride on it. It's comfortable.

321
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,600
It'll be 2,000 Berries for two
two-passenger Yagara bulls.

322
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,800
Wow, they're cute!

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,140
It's a fish that looks like a horse.

324
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,560
You jerk! What'd you do that for?!

325
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,900
Oh? He must like you. Let's get him for you.

326
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,820
Can he carry heavy stuff okay?

327
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,330
Their power is incredible!
You can even use them for moving.

328
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,410
That bag, huh? What's inside?

329
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,420
Gold.

330
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,290
You're funny. Whatever it is, it'll be fine.

331
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,260
--See?
--Whoa! Give me some!

332
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,340
No way!

333
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,090
What an awfully honest old guy...

334
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,050
You too! Don't show it to others so lightly!

335
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,050
Why? It wouldn't hurt, would it?

336
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,810
My, my... What a surprise...

337
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,850
Well, then... it'll be a million
Berries for two Yagara bulls.

338
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,810
Hey, the price went up, pops.

339
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,940
Sorry. It'll be five million Berries.

340
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,900
It went up even more!

341
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,990
You noticed?

342
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,780
Geez... We can't be too careful.

343
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,410
Here, 2,000 Berries.

344
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,280
Thanks.

345
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,030
By the way, are there any
money-changing shops around here?

346
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah, there are, but with that amount of gold,

347
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,370
the shops around here probably
wouldn't have enough money.

348
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,580
You should go to the downtown
area of the shipbuilding island.

349
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,420
The downtown area of the
shipbuilding island? Where is it?

350
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,970
It's over there. Take this with you.

351
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,970
A map?

352
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,140
This'll be helpful! Thanks!

353
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,270
Pops, is the shipyard there, too?

354
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,770
Yeah. The world's No. 1 shipyard!

355
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,650
That's perfect. Once we get the money,
we can go to the shipyard right away.

356
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,440
Yeah. We can finally have
the Going Merry repaired!

357
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,240
And we'll find a shipwright, too!
I'm getting excited!

358
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,160
--Well, then...
--Shall we...?

359
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,080
All right! Go! Yagara!

360
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,330
Thanks for your business! Be careful!

361
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,790
Dash to the shipyard!

362
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,170
Yahoo!

363
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

364
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

365
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

366
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

367
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

368
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

369
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

370
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,090
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

371
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

372
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

373
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

374
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

375
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

376
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

377
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

378
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

379
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,120
Eternally... Eternally...

380
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,090
Whoa! This is fun!

381
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,800
It's amazing that such a
convenient creature exists!

382
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,760
It doesn't rock much. It's comfortable!

383
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,720
Whoa! The canals even go above the rooftops!

384
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,390
I've never seen such a huge town before!

385
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,720
Yeah. This is a town built around canals!

386
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,310
Water Seven is getting me fired up!

387
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

388
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,570
"Adventure in the City on the Water!
Head to the Mammoth Shipbuilding Plant"

389
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
