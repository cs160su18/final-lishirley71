2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,360
Luffy was depressed after losing his
brother Ace in the war against the Navy.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,570
The King of the Pirates?!

61
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,790
I'm too weak!!

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,010
But at this time, he realized
the importance of friendship.

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,090
And he went back to Marineford
at Dark King Rayleigh's suggestion.

64
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,380
The rest of the Straw Hats got a message

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,180
through the news about
Luffy's mysterious behavior

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,680
and each starting taking
initiatives on their own.

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,500
Luffy wants to become
the King of the Pirates.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,360
I have to improve myself as a navigator!

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,750
Hey, Luffy. The Thousand Sunny
still has some life in her.

70
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,550
You're the only captain who can
make it "the ship of dreams."

71
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,730
Luffy, if I can see you again...

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,810
I'll give you the greatest
support in the world as a cook

73
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,010
so you can become the King of the Pirates!

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,520
"I Will Get Much, Much Stronger!
Zoro's Pledge to His Captain!"

75
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,160
On the Sword Mountain Island -

76
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,070
GRAND LINE SWORD MOUNTAIN
ISLAND - TEHNA GEHNA KINGDOM

77
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,070
Tehna Gehna Kingdom in the Grand Line...

78
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,530
Come one! Come all!

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,040
So many people are here!
What is there to see?!

80
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,710
I heard that they found a weird creature.

81
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,960
Now, come and see it! A
mysterious creature show!

82
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,880
No chest! No flesh!

83
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,840
No eyeballs!

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,800
It looks almost like a real skeleton!

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,660
And it only has one joint in its arms!

86
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,810
I wonder if there is a
creature rarer than this!

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,150
Hey, stop lying, you!

88
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,400
Huh? What's wrong with this?

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,060
It's not moving at all!

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,320
It's just a doll, isn't it?

91
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,220
Luffy-san has made up his mind.

92
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,900
Well, then I have to do something, too.

93
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,830
Hey, skeleton, don't mess with us!

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,510
I have to do something!

95
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,680
Oh, now you realize it,
huh? That's right. Move!

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,390
We have to show them something!

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,280
What can I do to help...

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,850
He just told you! It's enough
if you just move! Just move!

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,940
What's going on?!

100
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,080
When he saw me for the first time,
he didn't get scared at all and...

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,910
...asked me if I wanted to join them.

102
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,830
Putting that aside, you,

103
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,290
join my crew!

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah, okay.

105
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,430
For 50 years,

106
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,420
I was just drifting about on the dark water.

107
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,220
Words can't express how
happy I was to hear that.

108
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,310
This man stole my shadow.

109
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,140
Don't act like such a stranger!

110
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,030
If you need your shadow,
I'll take it back for you!

111
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,390
I'm so happy to be alive!

112
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,890
I bet you are!

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,480
--Can I join your crew?
--Yes, you can.

114
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,730
What?! So easily...

115
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,490
...He joined!

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,030
What?!

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,710
I can't explain how bright
you looked to me...

118
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,040
Because 50 years of waiting for a
miracle paid off at that moment.

119
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,500
--We want our money back!
--That's right!

120
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,550
Jeez! I thought he could be
profitable. We have no choice.

121
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,970
We should just force him to...

122
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,010
--What happened?
--Huh?

123
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,100
I-It's moving...

124
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,050
40 degrees!

125
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,480
What?!

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Oh, it's so hard!

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,070
It's really talking and moving!

128
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,700
--So creepy!
--What is that thing?!

129
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,710
If I try to go further than 45
degrees, I slip, just as I thought!

130
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,630
But when I overcome that...

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Maybe I can help Luffy-san more.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,720
No, maybe I have to look for another way...

133
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,770
--He holds a guitar!
--What is he gonna do?!

134
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,030
What is it this time?!

135
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,610
You don't have to do anything!
It's enough that you're a freak!

136
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,900
Alright, a freak! Call me whatever you like!

137
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,030
"Loneliness" is no longer
a part of my vocabulary!

138
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,660
But, everybody, isn't it boring to just look?

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,290
--What's this rhythm?
--It makes my heart skip a beat!

140
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,500
Check out my latest single -

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,560
Bone to be Wild!

142
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,400
Meanwhile, near the giant
bridge in the East Blue...

143
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,070
EAST BLUE - GIANT BRIDGE

144
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,370
What made you change your mind?

145
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,530
Now you agree to go to Baltigo with us.

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,400
Well, we're really glad anyway.

147
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,040
Dragon-san has always longed to meet you.

148
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,350
I didn't know there are people like you.

149
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,670
I wish that you guys had
come to see me earlier.

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,680
I-I'm sorry!

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,610
We didn't know that you
were allied with Crocodile.

152
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,680
Just kidding. I'm just teasing you.

153
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,170
No offense but I'm glad that
things turned out this way.

154
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,520
Let's go! Let's head for Baltigo!

155
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,030
Go and meet your friends

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,570
who must be waiting for you
somewhere out there, Robin!

157
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,220
--A bounty of 79 million berries?!
--For an 8 year old girl?!

158
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,300
She's a survivor of the demons of Ohara,

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,440
who attempted to destroy the world.

160
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
That Ohara?!

161
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,980
I don't know how she did it,

162
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,340
but they said she sank 6 Navy ships.

163
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,110
That's why the price is so high...

164
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,040
She shouldn't be alive!
She's the child of a demon!

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,710
Alright, wait there!

166
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,790
Why did you come to help?!

167
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,160
When did I ask you to do that?!

168
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,630
I want to die already!

169
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,030
I understand Robin's enemy very well.

170
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,980
Shoot that flag.

171
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,620
No way!

172
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,330
Are you guys insane?!

173
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,750
You think you can live when the
whole world is your enemy?!

174
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,830
I'm looking forward to it!!

175
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,090
Robin!

176
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,630
I need to hear you saying it!

177
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,100
Say that you wanna live!!

178
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:44,780
If you allow me to say what I
want, even a little bit, I...

179
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,990
...wanna live!!

180
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,450
Take me out to sea with you!!

181
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,510
Robin-san, come inside. It's cold out here.

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,220
I'll stay here. I'm a pirate and
you people are Revolutionaries.

183
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,320
I can't trust you so easily.

184
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,650
I can't just go into a
cabin that has no exits.

185
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,610
Please! We don't bear any
hostility toward you!

186
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,740
Let me stay here. This is how I
got through when I was on my own.

187
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm sorry. I understand.

188
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,060
Hey, bring as many blankets as you can!

189
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,750
And something hot to drink and eat, too!

190
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,080
But it's all prepared inside...

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,910
--Hurry up! And a wind guard and a sofa, too!
--Yes, sir!

192
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,550
Luffy, do you think I can get stronger

193
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,140
by swimming with the flow of the times...

194
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,510
...under your father?

195
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,140
I never thought that I'd
want to get stronger...

196
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,370
...for somebody else.

197
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,110
Meanwhile, on Bowin Islands
in the Grand Line...

198
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,420
GRAND LINE - BOWIN ISLANDS

199
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,800
What is it this time'n, Usopp'n?

200
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,890
First, I'll lose weight!
Then, improve my strength!

201
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, you better do that!

202
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,180
And get stronger!

203
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,140
Yeah, that's the only way
to get off of the island'n!

204
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,900
And get much stronger!

205
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,980
Yeah, that's good, too'n!

206
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,400
And get much, much stronger!

207
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,580
Oh? Th-That much'n?!

208
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,190
Much, much, much, much, much, much stronger!

209
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,820
Wow, you've become so serious'n!

210
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,520
You suddenly got with it...

211
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,750
What was it in that newspaper'n?

212
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
I received a message from our captain.

213
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,630
A message?

214
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,760
What're you talkin' about? Get on already.

215
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,890
Eh?!

216
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,930
We're friends now, aren't we?

217
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,110
Luffy!

218
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,370
U-Usopp...? You... You came here, too?

219
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,460
Beat him! And we'll all
go back together, Luffy!

220
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,790
Of course!!

221
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,050
I thought...

222
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:59,540
...that Luffy could become the King
of the Pirates without my help.

223
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,940
We made it here finally!

224
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,480
We'll see this wall again when
we go half way around the world!

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,900
And by that time, I'll be
the King of the Pirates!

226
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,720
But I was wrong.

227
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,780
There are a lot of
enemies who are beyond his power.

228
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,070
Luffy could lose.

229
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,670
He's pushing himself and crying out for help!

230
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,210
That's why...

231
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,200
...he needs my support!

232
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,760
Heracles'n, I wanna get stronger!

233
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,020
I wanna get much, much, much stronger and...

234
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,110
Hey, Master Heracles'n...

235
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,770
What? M-Master'n?

236
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,700
I've been curious about your weapons.

237
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,910
You're strong enough to live
on such a dangerous island.

238
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,320
I wanna learn a lot from you!

239
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,790
Strong? Am I a strong master'n?

240
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,790
Yes, you are a strong master!

241
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,000
And... my name is...

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,290
...Heracles'n!

243
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,420
What a cool name!

244
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,470
A-Alright, why don't you sit down, Usopp'n?

245
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,140
Yes, master!

246
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,800
Listen, my pupil Usopp'n!

247
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
There are many plants in this forest

248
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,400
called Pop Green, which
grow hostile instantly.

249
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,900
And these are the seeds'n.

250
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,820
Pop Green?

251
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,490
Each of them has an effective usage'n.

252
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,240
Usage'n, huh?

253
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,290
Wait for me, Luffy!

254
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,830
Run, Usopp'n! This forest
will make you stronger!

255
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,840
To make you the King of the Pirates,

256
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,760
I'll
become the real King of the Snipers!

257
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,690
Meanwhile, on the Gloom
Island in the Grand Line...

258
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,650
GRAND LINE GLOOM ISLAND -
THE RUINS OF MUGGY KINGDOM

259
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,840
the ruins of Muggy Kingdom.

260
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,110
Please!

261
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,870
Train me as a swordsman!

262
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm disappointed in you, Roronoa!

263
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you asking your enemy for instruction?

264
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,080
Shame on you.

265
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Get out of here. I have
no time for a boring man.

266
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,510
I think I was overestimating you.

267
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,520
What are you doing? That's just embarrassing.

268
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I wanna get stronger!

269
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,810
You were beaten by the baboons

270
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,470
and you couldn't get to
sea, so you came back here.

271
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,990
I have nothing to teach someone like that.

272
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,910
I beat the baboons.

273
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,700
He beat them?

274
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,660
You're the only one left to beat here!

275
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,090
But I'm not so stupid as to think
that I'm good enough to beat you!

276
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,120
I don't understand.

277
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,950
You still see me as an enemy.

278
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,100
Then why are you bowing to me
and asking for my guidance?

279
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,850
What's the purpose?

280
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,930
I wanna beat you!

281
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,610
You're asking me to train a
swordsman who wants to kill me?

282
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,660
You're weird. And what
you're asking is nonsense.

283
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,580
Even so, what you're doing
is still embarrassing.

284
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,130
Seems like you found something
more important than your ambition.

285
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,670
Hey, ghost girl, treat him.

286
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,470
Hey, don't tell me what to do!

287
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,970
The training will begin
when you're recovered.

288
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,480
Dammit! Everybody keeps
demanding so much of me!

289
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,040
Come on, move it now!

290
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,520
What a clumsy fool.

291
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,360
When a man like you swallows his pride,

292
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,450
it's always for someone else.

293
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,080
"3D" is crossed out and "2Y" is written?

294
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh yeah! There is a tattoo on his right arm!

295
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,480
We made a promise to meet again
at a certain place 3 days later.

296
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,340
But we couldn't make it.

297
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,500
So "3D" means "3 days"!

298
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,730
But "3D" is crossed out and "2Y"...?

299
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,770
--2 years!
--2 years!

300
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,980
The meeting will be 2 years
later instead of 3 days later.

301
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,400
And everything else was done
just to get all the publicity.

302
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,530
This is a message exclusively
to us. Luffy made a decision.

303
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,240
Even if we rush now, we're not good
enough to get far in the New World.

304
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,900
We have to stop once and get stronger.

305
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,710
And meet again no matter what!

306
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Hey, I told you to rest!

307
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,280
What are you...?!

308
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,240
That doesn't work!

309
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,700
W-Who the hell are you?!

310
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

311
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,620
The man who's gonna be King of the Pirates!

312
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,830
Until the day I defeat him and
become a master swordsman...

313
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll never... be defeated!
Got any problems with that...

314
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,760
...King of the Pirates?!

315
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,180
Nope!

316
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,230
There isn't enough time
for everything anyway.

317
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,140
So let's do it.

318
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,610
You said you beat the baboons.

319
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,990
They acquired their swordsmanship
by copying humans.

320
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,450
There are ranks among them
and there is a master.

321
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,330
He is the leader that rules all
the baboons on this island.

322
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,750
That sword is...

323
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,210
He mastered it by copying what I do.

324
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,340
He's different from the
baboons that you fought.

325
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,880
Sounds like fun!

326
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,390
I'm gonna get much, much stronger!

327
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,950
See you at Sabaody Archipelago in 2 years!

328
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,260
The Straw Hats have decided to become
stronger and reunite in 2 years.

329
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,760
Luffy arrives on the
uninhabited island Ruskaina,

330
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,850
where he begins training in a new power

331
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,290
in order to face new enemies and adventures

332
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,100
awaiting him in the New World!

333
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

334
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,120
"Luffy's Training Begins! To the
Place We Promised in 2 Years!"

335
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
