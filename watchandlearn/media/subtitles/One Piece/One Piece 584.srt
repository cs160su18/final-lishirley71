00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,520
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,250
If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

25

32

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,480
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,580
The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

62
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,580

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

66
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,180
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

74
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,570
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,150
After surviving a fierce battle,

78
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,610
the Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,--

79
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,250
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

80
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,030
Then help us!

81
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,030
What does he mean?

82
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,340
You have to help us! Please!

83
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,700
Please!

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,990
After being taken to a

85
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,430
mysterious facility by an
unknown group of people,

86
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,870
Nami and the others encountered
strange children.

87
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,130
Let's help these children!

88
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,420
What are you saying, Nami-san?!

89
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,420
We don't know for sure they need saving!

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,710
We just met them and we don't
know what's going on here!

91
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,680
It's not our job to help every single person!

92
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,730
I understand what you're saying but...

93
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,150
...you can't turn your back
on a child crying for help!

94
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,780
All right! Let's go!

95
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,540
I won't let you get away! Wait, you bastards!

96
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,170
Oh no!

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,210
That centaur again!

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,420
Boss!

99
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,410
The intruders are going that
way! Please finish them off!

100
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,180
Is that the Boss?

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,800
I see a man with swords.

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,330
So is that the samurai who cut our people?

103
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,360
Snow! Snow! I love playing with snow!

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,530
Ta-dah! Snowmen!

105
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,070
It looks like me!

106
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,990
Oh?

107
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,200
Hey! Hey!

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,290
Who the hell...

109
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,210
What?

110
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,420
Whaaat?!

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,170
"A Swordplay Showdown! Brook vs.
the Mysterious Torso Samurai!"

112
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,340
No matter how far we go, all
we see is a wall of ice.

113
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,340
There is no point in protecting ourselves
from the gas if we can't land.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,640
Don't give up yet. Keep searching.

115
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,170
It's no use.

116
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,010
An eruption?!

117
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,850
Around here, it feels like...

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,560
...we are being watched by Akainu and Aokiji.

119
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,030
--Oh, that's scary!
--Let's go back!

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,040
Stop the ship.

121
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,790
What happened?

122
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,550
There.

123
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,820
What?

124
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,090
Prepare to fire!

125
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,840
Fire!

126
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,740
Breaking the surface won't help...

127
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,440
There's a river!

128
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,010
Hey hey, that was amazing, Smo-yan!

129
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,040
I can't believe it!

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,440
How did you know there was a
river behind there, Smo-yan?

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,740
--Yeah, Smo-yan?!
--I didn't notice it at all, Smo-yan!

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,380
You can tell by looking at the sea current!

133
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
You have to pay attention!

134
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,420
You ought to check your own behavior too.

135
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,300
But it's strange.

136
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,150
Yeah.

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,800
The important thing is not the
fact that there was a river.

138
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,730
It is whether the ice that
was blocking the river mouth

139
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,020
was natural or man-made.

140
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,940
Do you mean  somebody was
hiding the river on purpose?

141
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,230
Who would wanna live on such an
island filled with the poison gas?

142
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,370
That's ridiculous! No one
wants to live with a mask on!

143
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,040
But the man on the Snail
mentioned the island.

144
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,740
You probably misheard it, Tashigi-chan!

145
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,360
Not even a Transponder
Snail could survive here!

146
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,240
That's right!

147
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,470
If you have time for laughing,
break up more ice!

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,640
--What the hell?!
--A wall of ice?!

149
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,190
If we collide into it,  even
this warship would sink!

150
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,730
--Oh no!
--We gotta destroy it!

151
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,150
Shoot!

152
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,660
PUNK HAZARD ISLAND - THE
MIDDLE LAKE LUFFY'S GROUP

153
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,290
They are...

154
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,670
Boss! Please take care of them!

155
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,450
Be ready!

156
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,300
I, Brownbeard-sama,

157
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:49,400
THE BOSS – BROWNBEARD - AN ALLIGATOR CENTAUR
(A FORMER PIRATE,  BOUNTY: 80 MILLION 60 THOUSAND BERRIES)

158
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,480
will kick your asses all the way to hell!

159
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,110
They're all centaurs!

160
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,050
I wonder if they wanna join us too!

161
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,240
I'm sure they don't!

162
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,200
They're obviously prepared to fight us!

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,290
They're colleagues of the man who sent
out the emergency signal, aren't they?

164
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,160
Yeah, they must be!

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,810
We have to clear the air
before they start to fight!

166
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,960
Hey!

167
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,130
We're here to help you
people! Let's talk first!

168
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,930
You're lying through your teeth!

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,900
You're with the samurai!

170
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,020
So there's no doubt that you're intruders!

171
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,230
Samurai?

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,730
He's talking about you!

173
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,920
No, he's not a samurai - he's a swordsman!

174
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,700
He's a dumb meathead who picks fights
without thinking sometimes but...

175
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,240
...he's not the one who attacked your people!

176
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,870
Who did you call "dumb"?!

177
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,250
Help! He's gonna kill me!

178
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,210
--I'm not gonna kill you! Stop saying that!
--They're having a falling out.

179
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,750
What a pathetic ploy!

180
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,080
We can't let them go any further! Shoot them!

181
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,970
Understood!

182
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,520
THE ICE LANDS - INSIDE OF THE
MYSTERIOUS FACILITY NAMI'S GROUP

183
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,400
This way, kids! Run if you wanna get away!

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,780
You're on fire, Chopper!

185
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,980
Of course!

186
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,350
Sanji entrusted me with
the important mission of

187
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,960
protecting the kids and
getting them out of here!

188
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,580
I'll do it!

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,980
I'll carry it through!

190
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,010
Why are those kids running?!

191
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm a man! Leave it up to me!

192
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,370
You're amazing, racoon bro!

193
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,250
I'm not a raccoon - I'm a reindeer! Hi-ya!

194
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,450
But where should we go?

195
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,620
That's something you need
to figure out. Wachaa!

196
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,120
Boy...

197
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,540
Sis, are we going to be okay?

198
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,590
Of course! We've been though
situations like this lots of times!

199
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,020
So just relax and follow us!

200
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,010
Uh-huh!

201
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,250
THE MYSTERIOUS FACILITY -
BISCUIT ROOM SANJI'S GROUP

202
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,270
Weapons Left!

203
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,910
Super!

204
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,870
He has weapons all over his body!

205
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,750
He's the one who broke the door!

206
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,690
Oh? You guys wanna know more about me?

207
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,220
Okay! I'll spend as much
time with you as you want!

208
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,800
Load the poison gas canisters!
There are no kids in here!

209
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,890
Fire at will!

210
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Why don't you take off your mask
and smoke some poison gas with us.

211
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,270
You bastard!

212
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,360
Don't get so mad.

213
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,410
--He ripped off our masks!
--He broke our air tanks too!

214
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,290
Don't use gas canisters!

215
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,710
What are they?!

216
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,550
Sheep?

217
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,750
What are you doing?

218
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,440
This one is different from the others!

219
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,310
Who is he? He's proving an able opponent!

220
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,770
Again, what are you talking about?

221
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,700
Well, that's what's going on with my torso!

222
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,030
IN FRONT OF THE MYSTERIOUS FACILITY BROOK

223
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,710
Hey! What's going on?!

224
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,500
Wh-Wh-Who are you?!

225
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,550
Where is your head and legs?!

226
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,060
You're scaring me! Please say something!

227
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,060
Shoot! Shoot!

228
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,460
We'll reach the end of the river soon.

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,840
I wonder what will be there!

230
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,460
I think I know.

231
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,120
Are you a ghost, by any chance?!

232
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,250
If so, you gotta obey the rules!

233
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Don't come out during the day!

234
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,730
I didn't do anything wrong!

235
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,170
I just set foot on the
island to make snowmen!

236
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,900
Oh, would you like to join
me and make one, too?

237
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,310
We can make a snow sculpture as well...

238
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,390
I was just kidding!

239
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,460
What's wrong with him?!

240
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,340
How can he attack me with such precision?!

241
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,010
He doesn't have eyes!

242
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,260
Oh yeah! I don't have eyes, either!

243
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,920
Scary! He's strong! Scary!

244
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,070
What do you want?!

245
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,630
Can't you just tell me
why you wanna fight me?!

246
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,760
Aubade Coup Droit!

247
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,790
Two-Sword Style?!

248
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,780
Enough already!

249
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,500
Scary! Scary! Gross!

250
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,600
Master!

251
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,680
Did you catch the escapees?

252
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,760
No, I have news about G-5.

253
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,060
Oh, them!

254
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,910
The poison gas didn't work.

255
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,490
Currently, they are breaking
through ice floes with a cannon

256
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,210
and slowly forcing their way into the island.

257
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,390
They'll reach the laboratory in time!

258
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,320
Why?

259
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,620
Why do they want to come
into the island so badly?

260
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,150
Do they know something?

261
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,560
Who is in charge?

262
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,520
Vice Admiral Smoker.

263
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,990
Smoker?

264
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,030
Of all others, that pain in the neck?

265
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,040
Conceal all the ships moored at the front.

266
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,910
Who's gonna deal with them?

267
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,830
No one's allowed to be here.

268
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,850
Don't let them find you at any cost.

269
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,340
Then you'll deal with them?

270
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,970
Don't be ridiculous! I can't
just show myself like that!

271
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,790
But there is no one else who can stop them!

272
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,680
Do you want me to do it?

273
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,980
We finally made it!

274
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,210
I thought I was gonna die!

275
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,030
We've only just landed on the island. Get up!

276
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,150
Don't be so harsh!

277
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,840
We did our best so be kind to us!

278
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,810
Don't be such a baby!

279
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,810
Smoker-san?

280
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,860
Calm down.

281
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,080
I thought so.

282
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,260
--There is no gas.
--What?

283
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,600
It's hard to believe but she's right.

284
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,770
Then why was there poison gas earlier?

285
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,760
Somebody who doesn't want to
welcome us released it probably.

286
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,230
Do you really think so?

287
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,290
Let's find out.

288
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,920
Is that...

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,660
Yes, Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory.

290
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,950
Former laboratory, I mean.

291
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,700
It should be abandoned and empty.

292
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,960
There is still power.

293
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,630
Who is living here?

294
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,470
Hey! Come on out!

295
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,460
What's taking you so long?!
Are you afraid of us?!

296
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,950
We don't have to ring a doorbell and wait!

297
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,720
We can just break the door with
the cannon of the ship, Smo-yan...

298
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,650
Smoker-san...

299
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,030
--Hey! Answer!
--Just open it!

300
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,090
You hear me?

301
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,660
No one is allowed to be here on this island!

302
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,010
Whoever you are, you're under arrest, fool!

303
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,340
Come on out now!

304
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,040
Ignoring us? Okay, bring the cannon here!

305
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,000
--Let's put a big hole in it!
--Hey!

306
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,630
It opened!

307
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,010
Now you're giving up? We're the Navy!

308
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,370
What brought you here - to my vacation home?

309
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,530
White Chase-ya!

310
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,050
No way!

311
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,870
He is...

312
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,290
He used to be a rookie with a 440
million berry bounty and now,

313
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,840
he is among them...

314
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,910
..."Hawk-Eye" Mihawk, Pirate
Empress Boa Hancock,

315
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,220
and Don Quixote Doflamingo.

316
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,000
Pirates backed by the World Government -

317
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
the Seven Warlords!

318
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,090
Trafalgar Law!

319
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,570
Let's go back, Smoker-san!

320
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,200
I don't want anything to do with him!

321
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,520
You know what he did!

322
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,750
To become a member of the Warlords...

323
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,330
...he delivered the hearts of one
hundred pirates to the headquarters!

324
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,060
He's crazy!

325
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,430
What a creep!

326
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,360
Why are you here?

327
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,610
No one, not even pirates
or Government allies,

328
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,570
is allowed to be here on this island, Law!

329
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,440
That means you people
are not allowed, either!

330
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,210
Law stands in Smoker's way,

331
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,280
and neither will yield a single step.

332
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,720
As the situation reaches its boiling point,

333
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,360
the Straw Hat Pirates suddenly
appear with the children in tow.

334
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,480
It was then that Law does something that causes

335
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,890
the situation to move immediately!

336
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

337
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,520
"A Swordplay Showdown! Brook vs.
the Mysterious Torso Samurai!"

338
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
