00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860

Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,660

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830
It’s important not to wake up

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,300
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,190
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,780
where they instigated an all-out war
against the New Fish-Man Pirates.

78
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,540
Luffy finally defeated
Hordy in a fierce fight

79
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,000
and thwarted his plot.

80
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,000
There's the Sunny!

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
Franky's there!

82
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,380
Looks like he's ready to go!

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,770
Here we go finally!

84
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,930
"Finally Time to Go!
Goodbye, Fish-Man Island!"

85
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,280
THE FISH-MAN ISLAND--CORAL
HILL "MERMAID CAFE"

86
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,680
Madam Sharley,

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,280
Luffy-chin and his friends
are leaving the island.

88
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,630
Oh yeah? Why don't you go and send them off?

89
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,920
Okay!

90
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,490
Madam! Can we go, too?!

91
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,750
What? We'd need to close the cafe then.

92
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,920
Tourists will start coming back
since that stupid Hordy is gone.

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,940
So I need you to give your best
for the cafe like before, girls.

94
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,930
You can count on us, Madam!

95
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,020
What? The crystal ball?

96
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,790
Don't worry. I won't need it again.

97
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,530
I will never again try to see the future.

98
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,030
Straw Hat destroying the Fish-Man Island...

99
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,870
I never wanted to see such a horrible future.

100
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,880
I'll be so happy if my prevision
is not accurate this time.

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,590
She is more afraid than anybody because
she knows it was always accurate.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,050
The future she saw may not happen soon.

103
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,970
It could be a year from now or more.

104
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,740
There is no reason to
believe it wasn't accurate.

105
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,060
But, Madam, Luffy-chin and his
friends would never do such...

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,940
Camie!

107
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,220
Forgive me for suspecting your friends.

108
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,400
I know what you want to say. I can
trust the Straw Hat boy, right?

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,680
Uh-huh!

110
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,390
These are some gifts! Take them!

111
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,530
Yeah, thanks!

112
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,230
Luffy-sama and everybody, are
you really going to leave now?!

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,100
We just became friends! Stay
here at least one more day!

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,570
No! A week!

115
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,330
No! Just one more year!

116
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,490
You've been crying since the
first time we met, Yowahoshi!

117
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,870
I-I am sorry!

118
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,070
I will stop being a crybaby!

119
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,950
I never thought the day like this would come!

120
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,800
The Mermaid Princess of the Fish-Man Island

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,470
who I've dreamed about is
crying as we're leaving!

122
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,680
Sanji-kun!

123
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,220
I wanna live here for a year or two!

124
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes, me too!

125
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,060
I sing about a dream life on the
Fish-Man Island on my latest single!

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,860
When you wake up in the morning you
say "Good mor-ningyo (mermaid)!"

127
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,160
--In the cafe at the night, you say "Good eve-ningyo!"
--Oh, my Mermaids!

128
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,910
That's a good idea!

129
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,670
Why don't you stay here, Nosebleed-kun?

130
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,570
What did you just call me, Moss Head?!

131
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,750
Who are you calling Moss Head, you fool?!

132
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,090
Your Majesty.

133
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,840
We have to tell them.

134
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,680
About the Tamate Box that
they gave to Big Mam.

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,730
When someone opens it, there
will be a huge explosion!

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,520
But, look at that!

137
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,910
We're doomed! One of the Four
Emperors wants to kill us!

138
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,770
We're gonna go to the New World just to die!

139
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,120
Do you think she'll forgive us

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,630
if we send all the treasures
that we get from now on?!

141
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,800
We cannot tell them that they
already sent her a bomb!

142
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,210
But those explosives are 10 years old.

143
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,090
Maybe they won't explode,
Minister of the Right.

144
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,350
Your Majesty, you are so positive!

145
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,810
Yes, the Ryugu Palace is very humid

146
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,070
and we don't even know if Big
Mam is going to open it herself!

147
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,740
Then let's just hope for their safety!

148
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,360
What are you two whispering about?

149
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,870
What is this?

150
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,400
It's a Log Pose for the New
World. Take it with you.

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,000
I cannot believe you were going to
go there with a single-needle one!

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh, what's that?

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,470
A new Log Pose? Wow, that's cool!

154
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,180
There are 3 needles. Why?

155
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,310
Look at the Log Pose that
you have been using.

156
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,320
It's still moving a little bit! I thought
it gathered enough logs already.

157
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,760
It did. And from now on, it would
take only half a day to record logs.

158
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,940
On the first half of the Grand Line,

159
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,330
you let the Log Pose record the
magnetic waves of the next island

160
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,250
and navigated your ship as it told you.

161
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,170
But on the second half of

162
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,650
the Grand Line, on top of the
sea current and the climate,

163
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,040
there are some islands that change their

164
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,360
magnetic waves, the only thing
you can normally count on.

165
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,540
And for some islands, the
magnetic waves just disappear.

166
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,820
What?! Then we can't reach those islands!

167
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,940
If you only have one
needle, you will get lost.

168
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,770
But what if you have 3 needles?

169
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,580
One of them is moving just
like the old one but...

170
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,070
…the other two look settled.

171
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,660
They each record the magnetic
waves from different islands.

172
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,370
That means you can choose whichever
your gut tells you and advance.

173
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,130
Whether you live or die hangs on that point.

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,210
A good navigator can tell

175
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,170
which way is safer to go

176
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,860
by looking at slight
movements of the needles.

177
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,640
What it basically tells you is
the wilder the needle moves,

178
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,350
the more dangerous the island is!

179
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,600
Something is happening on the island

180
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,460
that is causing the change
in its magnetic waves.

181
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,450
What?! I don't like this! I'd
rather not know about it!

182
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,130
You'll see if it's dangerous?!

183
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,000
No way! Break that Log Pose!

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,160
Why? You have to navigate
safely in order to stay alive.

185
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,490
Let's see.

186
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,680
D-Dammit!

187
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,390
No!

188
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:07,180
The one in the middle is wobbling a
lot! That must be where the party is!

189
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,190
H-H-He was listening!

190
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,330
Luffy! You stay quiet!

191
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,460
I'll choose which way to go from now on!

192
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,130
No way! I'm the captain!

193
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,240
Please Captain! Listen to what
the navigator has to say!

194
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,270
Nami-san's so cute when she gets frightened!

195
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,850
So cute! So cute...

196
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,880
The B-side of the single
is "The Requiem for Us"!

197
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,420
All right, guys!

198
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,170
We're ready to go!

199
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,260
Den-san taught me how to ascend too!

200
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,190
Shall we go?

201
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,890
Okay!

202
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,380
Let's go!

203
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,440
Luffy-chin!

204
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,300
Straw!

205
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I'm gonna help with repairing the factory!
Are you gonna be okay without a guide?

206
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,970
We're fine! We had a lot
of fun on our way here!

207
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,720
Yeah, he's right! We don't need a guide!

208
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,650
Man's journey always ends up in hell!

209
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,290
Yeah, yeah! We want a war, you bastard!

210
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,340
How desperate.

211
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,600
Everybody! Come visit someday!

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,510
I'll come back!

213
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,460
You're the "All Blue" of my heart!

214
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,850
What a cheap dream.

215
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,450
All I want to say is "Thank you"!

216
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,780
I will pray for your safe trip!

217
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,650
Uh-huh!

218
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,060
Next time we see you, we will lead
the strongest army on the seafloor!

219
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,090
Ooh mambo!

220
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,420
He's right!

221
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,480
We will become greater than the
Great Knight Neptune-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do!

222
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,420
Can't wait!

223
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,480
Um, where is he?

224
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,680
There you are!

225
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,390
Jimbei!

226
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,880
All right! Spread the sail!

227
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
Let's set sail!

228
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,200
Straw Hat!

229
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,750
See you, Fish-Man Island!

230
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,670
Alright, here we go!

231
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,310
Thank you, Straw Hat!

232
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,380
Come to eat sweets and meat anytime!

233
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,690
I like humans now!

234
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,690
Racoons and robots too!

235
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,650
Like I give a damn, you jerk!

236
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,530
Huh? Oh? What about bones?

237
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,410
Take care, Luffy-chin and everybody!

238
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,620
Come to eat octopus balls again!

239
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,040
You guys! I love you all!

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,270
1, 2, 3!

241
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,550
We like bones too!

242
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,060
Thank you for your concern!

243
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,570
Princess-sama!

244
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,390
Luffy-sama!

245
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,940
Yowahoshi!

246
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,040
Shirahoshi-chan!

247
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,010
If I can see you again someday,

248
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,850
I promise I won't be a crybaby!

249
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,940
Take me out for a fun stroll again!

250
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,810
A stroll? Do you wanna go to
your mother's grave again?

251
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,530
No. I want to go somewhere further next time!

252
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,790
I want to go to a real forest above ground!

253
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,210
Oh yeah, you've never been
out of the sea, have you?

254
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,380
Okay, fine!

255
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,740
I'll take you there next time!

256
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,940
Will you promise?

257
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,450
Yeah, trust me!

258
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,820
I promise!

259
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,020
Hey, Luffy! We have to help
you keep that promise.

260
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,490
Luffy-san, a promise is something
you have to keep at any cost.

261
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,490
Then, Shirahoshi, I promise you too!

262
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
Nami-chin-sama!

263
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,260
Me too!

264
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,830
Okay, me too!

265
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,970
Me too!

266
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,140
Me too!

267
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,050
Me too, of course!

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,340
We all promise her so...

269
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,380
...We won't let her down!

270
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,940
We promise!

271
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,900
E-Everybody!

272
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,230
So don't cry anymore!

273
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,040
Okay!

274
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,000
Do not ever forget their kindness.

275
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,540
Of course!

276
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,590
Hey, Dad, Dad!

277
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,390
Buy me a straw hat! I wanna
pretend I'm the hero!

278
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,710
What? They only sell it above ground!

279
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,480
Buy one above ground then!

280
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,750
No way!

281
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,480
There are horrible humans
who hate Fish-Men above...

282
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,200
What?

283
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,810
Oh, I mean, I heard some
of them are like that...

284
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,340
Of course, there are good and
strong humans like Straw Hat, too.

285
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,920
Oh, Boss Jimbei! You came at the right time!

286
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,340
I heard what you were talking about.

287
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,560
I will tell a merchant to get
his hands on some of those.

288
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,760
Really?!

289
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,980
Yes, what you want is that hero's hat, right?

290
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,060
Uh-huh!

291
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,030
I had a wonderful time!

292
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,850
The Mermaid Paradise!

293
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,720
Now everybody, pull yourself together!

294
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,370
There is no safe place once we sail out!

295
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,020
We have to pass though the dark water again.

296
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,670
What is that, Franky?

297
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm gonna make the ship float with
buoyant square logs of hollow Banyan.

298
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,780
I can adjust the speed by how many I put out.

299
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,290
What's the matter, Luffy?

300
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,500
If we ascend here,

301
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,100
we'll be at the sea where Shanks is!

302
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,550
I wanna see him!

303
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,270
In that case...

304
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,440
...I'll leave this hat with you.

305
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,380
It's dear to me.

306
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,060
Come bring it back to me someday!

307
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,930
Once you've become a great pirate!

308
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,380
There is one thing that makes me wanna stay.

309
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,340
That is my desire to see
you fulfill your dream.

310
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,160
But I'm sure that you can do it!

311
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,430
Because you're my brother!

312
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,020
Don't just think about the ones you've lost!

313
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,500
You can't get back what you've lost!

314
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,860
What is it that you still have?!

315
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,900
Rise to the top!

316
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,540
Luffy-san! Do you know what they call
the second half of the Grand Line?

317
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:02,800
People call the final sea beyond
the Red Line by another name.

318
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,670
"The New World."

319
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,550
"The New World."

320
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,140
It's the sea where pirates who will open
the way to the next generation gather.

321
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,470
The pirate who conquers the sea will
become the King of the Pirates!

322
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,280
Once we pass through this deep sea,

323
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,200
we'll get to the ultimate sea!

324
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Finally! I'll cut everything away!

325
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,830
Wait for me, Laboon! One more half to go!

326
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,640
Count on me! I'll navigate
you anywhere you want!

327
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,090
That's right! The Sunny can do it!

328
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,710
I'll heal you no matter how wounded you are!

329
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,670
You'll never go hungry while I'm here!

330
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,090
You've got the warrior of the sea here too!

331
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,770
Let's go!

332
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,310
Guys!

333
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,580
To the New World!

334
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,010
Yeah!

335
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,240
The Straw Hats depart Fish-Man Island
and rise up out of the sea.

336
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,840
But it's the harshest
ocean of the Grand Line.

337
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,810
On the voyage up to the New World...

338
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,640
...they come across hardship after hardship.

339
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,450
As the crew is tossed about...

340
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,620
...by a killer underwater whirlpool...

341
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,440
...an unimaginable sight appears before them.

342
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,940
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,680
"To the New World! Heading for the Ultimate Sea!"

344
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
