00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,310
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,550
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,340
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,600
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,230
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,760
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,810
Everyone! Hold on tight
to the ship or get inside!

20
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,290
The ship's going up!

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,740
--Spread the sails! Right away!
--Eh?

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,620
If we're dealing with wind
and sea, I can navigate it!

23
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,040
Who's this ship's navigator?!

24
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,080
You are, Nami-san!

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Awesome! The ship is flying!

26
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,510
What could be up there?!

27
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,620
Let's plunge through
the cumuloregalis clouds!

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,730
"Sail the White Sea! The Sky Knight
and the Gate in the Clouds"

29
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,210
Can't breathe...!

30
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,800
Drat! They got away!

31
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,240
They're lucky...

32
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,370
You're pretty carefree, after our
prey just got away from us!

33
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,320
Do something, Captain! Let's go
after 'em and take 'em down!

34
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,650
Don't fret, Burgess!
They haven't left this world!

35
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,570
We'll run into 'em soon enough!
As long as we're on the Grand Line!

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,410
Exactly.

37
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,580
All things in this world are cogs
that move in tune to strong desires.

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,090
--See?!
--You're so right!

39
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,320
Damn... What happened?! Is everyone here?!

40
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,910
Hey, guys! Look outside the ship!

41
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,410
What is this place?!

42
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,080
It's pure white!

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,790
--Clouds?!
--We're in the clouds?!
How are we staying on them?!

44
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,950
Of course you can stay on them! They're clouds!

45
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,250
No, you can't!

46
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,370
Oh, no! Usopp isn't breathing!

47
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,170
What?! Do something! CPR!

48
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,730
Okay! I'll give Nami-san CPR!

49
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,050
--Moron...
--Usopp! Say something!

50
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,830
Usopp!

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,560
Clouds... What?!

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,530
These are clouds! No, there's
too many! What is this?!

53
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,370
Basically, this is an ocean in the sky?

54
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,360
An ocean... in the sky?!

55
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,960
But look! The Log Pose is still pointing upward!

56
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,020
It seems we're in the middle section
of the cumuloregalis clouds.

57
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,490
We need to go even higher? How?

58
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,170
That, I don't know...

59
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,320
--Did you call me a moron?!
--I forget.

60
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,010
An ocean...!

61
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,480
In Swimming Lane #1, Captain Usopp!

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,720
--You can do it! Good luck!
--Yay!

63
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,730
Hey, now! Don't be reckless!
This ocean's still a mystery!

64
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,330
An ocean's an ocean!

65
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,690
--Awesome!
--He's so brave!

66
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,580
There's so little resistance...
But it's hard to see anything at all...

67
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,620
Oh! I'm going deeper and deeper! So easily...!

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,750
Usopp's so lucky! If only I could swim, too!

69
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,050
I bet it's so fun...

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,220
Hey.

71
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,740
He's... not coming back up.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,460
I was just wondering... Do you
think this ocean has a bottom?

73
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,610
--You don't mean...!
--Did that bastard fall from the clouds?!

74
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,030
Usopp!

75
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,030
That moron! I tried to tell him!

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,120
Stretch your arm as far as you can!

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,250
--But I can't see down there!
--It's all right. Leave it to me!

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,670
Ojos Fleur!

79
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,350
--There he is!
--Eh?! Where?!

80
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,150
Veinte Fleurs!

81
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,200
Okay! Pull him up!

82
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,010
You got him?! Okay!

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
Is he heavy?!

84
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,460
--He shouldn't be.
--Luffy! You can do it!

85
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,130
You can do it!

86
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,600
Yes! He's back up!

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,250
Things came with him!

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
They wanna eat Usopp!

89
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,690
It's nothing to be that afraid of!

90
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,730
Huh?!

91
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,510
But it sure is hard to breathe here...

92
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,810
This is one strange creature...
I'm not even sure if it's a fish...

93
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,570
That octopus was like a balloon!

94
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,920
It's definitely an animal. It was moving.

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,880
I can't believe things live in clouds...!

96
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,320
Perhaps we should think of this
as an ocean rather than clouds.

97
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,020
What's this flat snake?

98
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,820
A flounder! Because it's flat!

99
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,530
So this is a flounder?!

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,830
Dammit! What is it this time, Usopp?!

101
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,360
My pants! There was something in 'em!

102
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,420
Usopp!

103
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,990
Sky island scary, sky island scary...

104
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,530
What an unlucky day.

105
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,480
These are skyfish! The odd fish
described in Noland's logbook.

106
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,360
They must have evolved to survive
in this bottomless sky ocean...

107
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,970
So they turned all
balloon-like and flat and stuff?

108
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,630
To be even lighter...

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,670
The buoyancy here is weaker
than in the oceans below.

110
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,080
They have scales like feathers,
and weird carnivore-like mouths!

111
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,210
I tried sautéing it.

112
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,130
--This is good!
--We're still investigating it!

113
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,080
What're you guys thinking?!

114
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,010
Oh! It really is good! What is this?!
I've never had anything like it!

115
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,960
Is it to your liking, Nami-san?!

116
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,710
Let's eat that big one, too!

117
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,100
That one looks like it'd be a lot of work...

118
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Where is the sky island?

119
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,810
Oh! A ship...

120
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,270
A ship! Hey, guys! A ship... and a person?

121
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,240
Eh?

122
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,900
Eh?!

123
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,900
Hey. What's wrong, Chopper?

124
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,720
Is there a ship out there, Chopper?

125
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,560
No, uhh, there was, but not anymore...!

126
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,980
Huh?

127
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,120
--And there's a bull, and it's
running straight here, it's on...
--You're not making sense! Calm down!

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,030
What's wrong with you?

129
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,340
It's a person! Someone's coming!

130
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,130
He's running on the clouds!

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,470
Hey, stop! What do you want?!

132
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,510
To eliminate you!

133
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,050
--Looks like he wants to fight!
--Fine by me!

134
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,470
What's going on?!

135
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,480
H-Hey! What's with you three?!

136
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,560
He's gonna shoot us!

137
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,700
Sky island scary, sky island scary...

138
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,160
That is far enough!

139
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,550
What?! Who's this now?!

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,800
I am the Sky Knight.

141
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,270
He's gone...

142
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,960
What the heck's going on?! Who was that?!

143
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,300
And what's with you guys?! You're
pathetic, losing three against one!

144
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,610
Thank you for saving us!

145
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,520
I have no choice. This one is on the house.

146
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,350
Man... Talk about being worthless...

147
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,610
I can't move well... for some reason...

148
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,280
--It must be because of the thin air.
--Yeah, now that you mention it...

149
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,110
Are you Blue Sea people?

150
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,540
Blue Sea people? What's that?
Oh, yeah! Who are you?!

151
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,640
I am the Sky Knight.

152
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,130
"Blue Sea people" is the term for
those who live beneath the clouds.

153
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,280
The Sky Knight...

154
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,130
In other words, did you come
up here from the blue seas?

155
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,490
Yeah! That's right!

156
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,640
Then that explains it. This is the
White Sea, 7,000 meters in the air.

157
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,220
The White-White Sea even further
above reaches 10,000 meters high.

158
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,930
Ordinary Blue Sea people
can't possibly endure it here.

159
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,240
Alright! I've gotten used to it!

160
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,560
Yeah. I feel much better now.

161
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,140
No, no, no! That is not possible!

162
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,700
Anyway, why was that guy
speeding on top of the clouds?!

163
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,580
Now, now. Hold on.

164
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm sure you have many questions,
but let's talk business first.

165
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,400
Business?

166
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,630
I am a freelance soldier-for-hire.
These seas are fraught with danger.

167
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,120
If you don't know how to fight
in the sky, guerrillas like that one

168
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
will come after you and turn
you into food for the skyfish.

169
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,010
For a 5,000,000 Extol One Whistle,
I will help you.

170
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,140
What're you talking about, old guy?

171
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,040
What?! That is quite cheap!
I won't lower it a single Extol more!

172
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,070
I need to earn a living too, you know!

173
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,610
What in the world is "Extol"?
And what's this "whistle" or whatever?

174
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,320
You came here via the summit
of High-West, did you not?

175
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,700
Then you must've passed an island or two.

176
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,150
Again, what're you talking about, old guy?

177
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,050
Wait! You mean there are other
ways of coming to this sky ocean?!

178
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,750
And "an island or two"? Does that
mean there are lots of sky islands?!

179
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Don't tell me you came here via the...

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,740
We rode the Knock-Up Stream.

181
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,720
My word! That monstrous current?!

182
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,720
So there still are people
gutsy enough for that...

183
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,720
It wasn't a normal route, after all...!

184
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,600
We could've died, you know!

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,460
We could've done it more safely if
we had gathered more information!

186
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,940
What does it matter now? We're already here.

187
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,190
Sky islands scary, sky islands scary...

188
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,850
Did you lose any of your crew?

189
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,070
No, we're all here.

190
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,820
That wouldn't have been
the case with any other route.

191
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,300
100 people head into the sky,
a few arrive, and someone survives.

192
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
That is the gamble.

193
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,480
But with the Knock-Up Stream,
everyone dies or everyone arrives.

194
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,540
That's it.

195
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,210
Not many can make that all-or-nothing bet,

196
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,860
especially these days.

197
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,510
I now see that you are capable
navigators with courage and skill.

198
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,840
Yes, I must admit it was
only because I was here!

199
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,080
While these guys were on their
knees crying and giving up on life,

200
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,730
--I told them, "I will navigate us--"
--Hold on!

201
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,940
One blow of this One Whistle...

202
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,870
...and I shall come to your aid!

203
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,220
Normally, I would charge five million Extol,

204
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,830
but I will give you the
One Whistle as a present!

205
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,750
Wait! We still don't know your name!

206
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,030
I am Gan Fall, the Sky Knight!
And this is my partner, Pierre!

207
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,800
I forgot to mention it, but my partner Pierre...

208
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,850
...is a bird that ate a Horse-Horse
Fruit and gained its powers.

209
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,230
A bird?!

210
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,840
In short, he becomes a horse with wings!

211
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,370
Namely...

212
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,400
No way! Wow! A Pegasus?!

213
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,290
Yes! A Pegasus!

214
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,330
How... unexciting.

215
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,360
May luck be with you, warriors!

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,150
That was a weird thing it turned into...

217
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,400
Was there even a reason for it to transform?

218
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,170
Good question...

219
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,210
In the end, he didn't tell us anything.

220
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,690
You're right! Nothing at all!

221
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,640
Now we're back to square one.

222
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,050
How do we get up there?!

223
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,140
I know! Let's call that old guy and ask!

224
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:09,130
H-H-Hold on, Luffy! This is only
supposed to be used in emergencies!

225
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,260
What if that weird masked
guy shows up again?!

226
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,020
For now, let's take our ship somewhere.

227
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,950
Hey, look over there!

228
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,220
--What could that be?
--Isn't that a weird cloud?

229
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,120
It also looks like a waterfall...

230
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,720
Alright! It's decided! Let's check it out!

231
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Wait! Stop! Stop!

232
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,580
There are huge clouds in the way...

233
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,740
What do we do?

234
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,370
They're floating in the sky ocean,
so they can't be ocean, too...

235
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,830
Then what kind of clouds are they?

236
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,030
If they were ordinary clouds,
they'd keep moving forward...

237
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,130
Let's touch one and find out!

238
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,000
Gum-Gum Pistol!

239
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,580
It bounced off!

240
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,020
Look! I'm on it! I'm not sinking!
It's all fluffy, like cotton!

241
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,170
What is this?! What is this?! It's too fun!

242
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,640
Wow!

243
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,750
--Now how does this work?!
--It's mysterious...

244
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,150
Me too! I'm coming, too!

245
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,310
Me too!

246
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,840
This feels great! It's warm and
makes me wanna sleep right here!

247
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,280
It's even better than a freshly-aired futon!

248
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,620
But this means the ship can't go
through places filled with these...

249
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,750
Hey! Find a route that the ship can take!

250
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,210
Right! Okay!

251
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,800
Hey, Luffy! There's something over here!

252
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,890
--What is it?! What is it?!
--Hey! Where are you going?!
Quit playing around!

253
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,120
--What is that?
--A gate?

254
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah! There's a big gate
under that waterfall thingy!

255
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,720
There are manmade objects
in a place like this?

256
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,180
There could be anything in this ocean
and it wouldn't be surprising...

257
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,720
We'll find out what it is
after we get through here!

258
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,840
--Left next!
--No, right!

259
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,800
--It's to our left!
--No, our right!

260
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
Let's call the old armor guy!

261
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,270
Stop that!

262
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,790
Alright! Looks like we're through!

263
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,850
It's a gate, all right...

264
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,610
And look, that waterfall-like
cloud really was a waterfall!

265
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,470
It's flowing over those
different clouds from earlier!

266
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,780
What's this now? "Heaven's Gate"...?!

267
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,480
That's unlucky! It sounds
like we're on our way to die!

268
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,530
Y'know, maybe we already are dead.

269
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,400
Ah! That would explain this weird world...

270
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,300
Eep! We're dead?!

271
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,160
Heaven, huh? This is gonna be great!
I finally get to go there!

272
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,820
Get real!

273
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,020
What was that for?!

274
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,000
Your jokes aren't funny!

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,810
Why did I get hit, too...?

276
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,300
Look! Over there! Someone's coming out!

277
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,070
Look! She has wings on her back!

278
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,690
It's an angel! Is that what angels are like?!

279
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,020
She's like a pickled plum!

280
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
U-Umm...

281
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,440
I am Amazon, the Heaven's Gate inspector.

282
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,120
Sightseeing? Or perhaps war?

283
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,880
I-I guess it's kind of like sightseeing...

284
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,670
We wanna go to the sky islands!
They're past this gate, right?

285
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,790
What do you mean by "war"?

286
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,100
It doesn't matter either way.

287
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,860
If you're going to the upper area,

288
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,520
pay the entrance fee of
one billion Extol per person.

289
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,720
That is the law.

290
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,710
O-One billion?!

291
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,060
There's that "Extol" stuff again...

292
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,440
How much is one billion Extol in Berries?

293
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,430
Whatever it is, one billion
sounds really expensive!

294
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,110
One billion per person...
Seven billion for seven people...

295
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,000
It's just to enter the country!

296
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,120
Do countries usually charge
that much just to enter?!

297
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,910
This old lady's trying to scam--

298
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,080
U-Umm, about the money...
What if we kinda don't have it...?

299
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,790
--You can pass.
--Are you serious?!

300
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,310
Or you don't have to pass.

301
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,760
I am neither a gatekeeper nor a guard.
I simply ask your intentions.

302
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,790
Then let's go! To the sky islands!

303
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,920
We don't got money,
but we're going through, old lady!

304
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,810
I see. The seven of you, then?

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah. But how do we get to the sky islands--

306
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,740
--Eh?!
--What the...?! Something's here!

307
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,200
The White Sea's famous Express Lobster...

308
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,620
It's moving!

309
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
It's a huge lobster!

310
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,380
Is it planning to go up the waterfall?!

311
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,580
--Hold on tight!
--What speed!

312
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,570
It's still a ways to the top!

313
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,570
This is Heaven's Gate Inspector Amazon!

314
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,880
Attention, almighty God and His priests...

315
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,950
Seven illegal entrants
into God's Land, Skypiea...

316
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,950
Give unto them Heaven's Judgment!

317
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,350
Give unto them Heaven's Judgment!

318
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,770
Ah, beyond the never-ending sky

319
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:27,990
The future that I once saw
is now starting to take shape

320
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:43,710
There are days where I almost lose to myself

321
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,750
When that happened, there was
someplace warm I could go

322
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,290
The friends I took pride in
always, without fail,

323
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:08,300
pushed me onwards, didn't they?

324
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:17,570
Ah, the stars are pouring
down underneath the sky

325
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,930
This unique moment...

326
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,930
Heaven is this terrifying of a place?!
It's not supposed to be like this!

327
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,180
This isn't Heaven!

328
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,890
Look! An angel's coming this way!

329
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,580
She's probably all wrinkly like the last one...

330
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,600
No... It's the real deal this time!

331
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

332
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,170
"Godland, Skypiea!
Angels on a Beach of Clouds"

333
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
