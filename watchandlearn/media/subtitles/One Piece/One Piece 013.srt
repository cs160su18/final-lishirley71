2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,710
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,110
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,350
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,700
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,320
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,200
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,450
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,060
Indeed, tomorrow is a
day to commemorate.

25
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,890
I refuse to let them enter the village!

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,180
Straight north! Straight north!

27
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,280
They're in big trouble
if they touch my treasure!

28
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,600
Dammit! What do I do?!
I can't climb up!

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,100
Outta the damn way!

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,380
I can't let you get past this slope...

31
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,150
Because I only lied, like I always do...

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,250
So the village is going to have
just another ordinary day!

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,230
So I absolutely won't let you go!

34
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,400
They're late...

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,790
They all know full well what happens...

36
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,830
...to those who upset my plans...

37
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,710
I'll slaughter them all!

38
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,230
"The Terrifying Duo!
Meowban Brothers vs. Zoro"

39
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,330
About time...

40
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,660
Y-You guys are that strong?!

41
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,670
Yeah!

42
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,590
What took you guys so long?!

43
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,630
You're the one who
got me stuck back there!

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,450
That was an accident!
It couldn't be helped!

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,630
It's better for one person to be saved

46
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,550
than for two to stay down there...

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,350
Then you should've stayed!

48
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,740
Seriously! How am I supposed to
know which way north is and isn't?!

49
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,570
What?! You're the one who ran
off first, all full of confidence!

50
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,500
That was just because.

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,640
Night is long gone now...

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,250
He-- Captain Kuro--
has a short temper...

53
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,750
Hey, men! Don't tell me those
two brats did you all in?!

54
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,840
Listen! We don't have time
to be dilly-dallying here!

55
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,810
If our enemy is strong,
we just need to be stronger!

56
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,850
Now watch this ring closely!

57
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,690
On "one, two, Jango,"
you guys'll grow strong.

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,860
Your wounds will be completely healed,

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,430
and you will grow
stronger and stronger!

60
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,140
What're they doing?

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,960
It's hypnosis!

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,460
He's trying to convince
them to be stronger!

63
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,530
How ridiculous!

64
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,780
Stronger... Stronger!

65
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,640
One! Two!

66
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,970
Jango!

67
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,670
No way!

68
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,430
H-He gouged out the cliff!

69
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,820
What power!

70
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,250
They really did get hypnotized!

71
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,730
With that many people that strong...

72
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,660
Go! Crush anyone who gets in the way!

73
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,130
You guys get back!

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,900
We'll handle this!

75
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,490
Hey, Luffy!

76
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,880
Luffy?!

77
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,280
You got hypnotized too?!

78
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,210
W-What a simple-minded person!

79
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,330
Gum-Gum...

80
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,670
...Gatling!

81
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,080
Damn you, Captain Kuro...

82
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,280
You were completely wrong
to think he'd have no effect!

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
These guys are no ordinary brats!

84
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,010
Where is he going?!

85
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,390
Wha--?

86
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,920
What's he planning to do?!

87
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,560
Go! Luffy!

88
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,270
He's gonna destroy the ship!

89
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,870
No, he's not!

90
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,280
He's gonna crush us with that!

91
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,910
Please do something, Captain!

92
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,510
Crap! Crap! This was
no time to be gawking!

93
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,310
On "one, two, Jango",
you'll get sleepy!

94
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,620
One!

95
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,900
Two!

96
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,000
Jango!

97
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,610
Eh?! Klahadore the butler
went to the shore?!

98
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,800
Yeah! And he had a
scary look on his face!

99
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,820
Is Kaya-san okay?!

100
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,550
Alright! Let's move out, Usopp Pirates!

101
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,400
Hey! Quit sleeping!

102
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,290
But I should still be in bed...

103
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,240
This is no time to be sleeping!

104
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,630
We could be in trouble!

105
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,990
Eh?

106
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,260
I think pirates really
are going to attack us.

107
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,490
Our captain said he was lying,
but I think that was a lie!

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,330
I think so, too!

109
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,300
Me, too! Something just wasn't
right about our captain yesterday!

110
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,880
You don't think...

111
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,980
But our captain used
to go through here!

112
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,400
No good! It's closed up|

113
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,590
Let's look for another one!

114
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,030
You! How dare you make a fool of me,

115
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,650
insulting me for having
the blood of a pirate?!

116
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,550
Stop, Usopp-san!

117
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,800
Klahadore...

118
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,680
Are you there, Klahadore?

119
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,010
Klahadore?

120
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,710
M-Merry!

121
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,610
Merry!

122
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,690
What's wrong?! What happened?!

123
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
Open your eyes, Merry!

124
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
Please don't die!

125
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,820
M-Miss...

126
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,510
Thank goodness, you're all right...

127
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,960
Merry!

128
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,950
Merry? W-who did this?!

129
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,590
Klahadore! He... attacked me!

130
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,050
He... he was a pirate all along!

131
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,560
W-What are you talking about?

132
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:14,080
He got close to you so he
could get your fortune...

133
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,600
No... That's absurd!

134
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,910
It's the truth!

135
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,190
Then, what Usopp-san
said yesterday was...

136
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes. Now that I think about it,

137
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,970
he tried his hardest to help us
when he learned the truth!

138
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,230
Yet, not a single one of us
even tried to hear him out!

139
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,650
You gotta run, Kaya!
They're gonna kill you!

140
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,070
You gotta escape for now!

141
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,210
We protected a real villain
and drove off that brave lad,

142
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,170
who ran about with desperate resolve,

143
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,460
all for the villagers' sake!

144
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,120
S-Someone help! Merry is--!

145
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,970
It's no use, Miss!

146
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,570
The staff has been on
leave since yesterday.

147
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,120
What?! Then I'll...

148
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,060
You mustn't get flustered!

149
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,610
The incident hasn't happened yet!

150
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,900
You must think calmly about
what you need to do now!

151
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,840
If Klahadore's goal is
your fortune and mansion,

152
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,390
then just let him have it all!

153
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,510
They're not worth
protecting with your life!

154
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,950
You're right.

155
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,080
Cruel as it may be,

156
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,920
you are the only one who
can stop Klahadore now.

157
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,310
Can you do it?

158
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,260
This isn't your responsibility, but...

159
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,350
Even I know this isn't a
situation I can run from...

160
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,970
I understand that fully!

161
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,060
I'll talk things over with Klahadore!

162
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,340
What're you doing?!

163
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,000
Hold on tight!

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,840
But these bars are slippery!

165
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Climb over anyways!

166
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,480
Aren't you worried about Kaya-san?!

167
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,080
Oh, no! Someone's coming out!

168
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
Hide!

169
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,000
It's Kaya-san!

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,340
She's alright!

171
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,350
It looks like something has her worried!

172
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,660
Kaya-san, walking
outside all by herself...

173
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,680
Something's up!
Something's gotta be up!

174
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,230
Looks like they're just about wiped out!

175
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,330
I guess so.

176
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,670
Hey! Never mind that,
Luffy's trapped under there!

177
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,000
He won't die.

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,960
Worry about your own
injuries or somethin'.

179
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,450
Damn that brat!

180
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,710
Now the plan's really screwed up!

181
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,350
If Captain Kuro caught sight of this,

182
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,620
he'd slaughter all of us, too!

183
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,480
Hey, Butchie! Come look!
This is bad stuff!

184
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,950
What the hell?!

185
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,150
We still have a trump card!

186
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,460
Come forth, Meowban Brothers!

187
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,140
You called, Captain Jango?

188
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,370
You called?

189
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,950
Siam...

190
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,990
...and Butchie!

191
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,820
Together, we are the
Meowban Brothers!

192
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,900
Butchie! Siam! We absolutely
must get past this hill,

193
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,020
but as you can see,
an obstacle is in the way!

194
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,970
Get rid of it.

195
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,800
W-We can't possibly do that!

196
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,240
Right, Butchie?!

197
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,870
Yeah, he looks strong!

198
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,250
Huh?

199
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,010
And besides, we're just
supposed to guard the ship!

200
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,880
Yeah! This isn't really
our place to fight...

201
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,380
W-What? They're not
their trump card?!

202
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,490
Siam! Get going already!

203
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,360
Eh?! M-Me?!

204
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,390
Hurry!

205
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,770
O-Okay, okay! I'll go!

206
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,770
He's in tears! What's he trying to do?!

207
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,070
Why's he making him fight?

208
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,640
Hey, you! Get ready!

209
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm gonna scratch you
good with these claws!

210
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,780
What am I supposed to do?!

211
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,570
Hey, you! Stop or I'll kill you!

212
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,120
If you can!

213
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,840
What?!

214
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,920
What the hell?!

215
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,840
You!

216
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,870
You just underestimated
me, didn't you?!

217
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,590
I'm impressed you could block that,
after my innocent cat act!

218
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,270
You seem to have a little skill,

219
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,410
but I wouldn't underestimate
Siam of the Meowban Brothers!

220
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,580
Missing something?
Don't look at me, though...

221
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,430
There it is...

222
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,740
"Cat Burglar"...

223
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,320
Give those swords back!

224
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,400
Give them back?
But you already have a sword.

225
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,860
These are just in the way.

226
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,000
Alright! Now I'm much lighter!

227
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,680
You're supposed to take good
care of other people's things!

228
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,480
Bastard!

229
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,320
What?!

230
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,310
What did you cut?!

231
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,310
I can bend like a cat!

232
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,690
You're up, Butchie! Get 'im!

233
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,570
Right, Siam!

234
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,580
Cat...

235
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,710
...astrophe!

236
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,210
Damn! He got away!

237
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,950
Hey! Hold him down, Siam!

238
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,450
My bad!

239
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,370
The bastard's way
stronger than I thought!

240
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,750
What the hell?!

241
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,530
One hit from that'd turn every
bone in my body to powder!

242
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,140
He's not getting away this time!

243
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,480
'As right!

244
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,110
I'm not that great at the
One-Sword Style, but...

245
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,770
Let's go, Butchie!

246
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,570
Okay! Let's do it, Siam!

247
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,010
--Pussy Willow March!
--Pussy Willow March!

248
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh, no! They got
Zoro on the defensive!

249
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,990
What're you doing?!

250
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,160
He's not gonna get anywhere just
blocking those two guys' attacks!

251
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,570
I'm gonna help him out!

252
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,170
Take this!

253
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,430
Lead Star!

254
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,290
Gotcha!

255
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,780
Why're you attacking
a guy on our side?!

256
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,030
No, it's not like that!

257
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,630
It seemed like he let
it hit him on purpose...

258
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,460
Eh?! On purpose?!

259
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,260
Usopp, you dumbass!

260
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,710
Do you want to die?!

261
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,390
You don't suppose...

262
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,580
...we're the ones who just got saved?

263
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,680
Had you hit them with that slingshot,

264
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,180
those two probably would've
come after us instead!

265
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,940
He...

266
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,700
But this is no time for that!

267
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,830
Damn it! If I just had another sword!

268
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,930
I'm gonna get his swords!

269
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,100
If I give 'em back to Zoro,
he'll win for sure!

270
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,250
In that case, I'll do it!

271
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,590
Don't push yourself!
You can barely even stand!

272
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,310
Nami!

273
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,540
Nami!

274
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,090
What do you need swords for?

275
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,320
No! Uhh! I-I can explain!

276
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,070
Night is long gone now,

277
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,560
so it seemed odd that the plan
wasn't making any progress...

278
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,770
C-Captain Kuro!

279
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,280
W-We're dead!

280
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,200
This can't get any worse!

281
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,230
What is all this?!

282
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

283
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

284
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

285
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

286
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

287
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

288
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

289
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,410
What the--?! Did they
have a falling out?!

290
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,410
He's handling those two
like they're nothing!

291
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,280
I can't sense where damn Kuro is!

292
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,600
Kaya-san! Look out!

293
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,590
What's she doing here?!

294
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,550
Hey, where's Luffy?!

295
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,250
Still asleep! Urgh!

296
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,220
--Get up already!
--Get up already!

297
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,420
I'll protect the meat shop...

298
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,590
On the next episode of One Piece!

299
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,200
"Luffy, Back in Action!
Miss Kaya's Desperate Resistance"

300
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,020
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
