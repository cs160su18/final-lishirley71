Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,320
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,870
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,140
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,750
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,550
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,870
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,080
Meanwhile, to reach Yuba,
where the rebel army is,

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Luffy's group set into the desert...

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,040
...where numerous, unimaginable
hardships fell upon them!

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,060
"Enter the Desert Pirates!
The Men Who Live Freely"

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,150
So hot... Water...

32
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,320
Thanks, Zoro. This heat
is too much for me...

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,220
Don't act polite. It's stifling.

34
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,360
Nami-san! How far did you go?!

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,850
That side of you is wonderful too!

36
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,700
Huh?

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,430
What's the matter, Luffy?

38
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,870
This is much easier
thanks to you, Lashes!

39
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,000
But will the others be all right?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,050
They'll just follow the footprints!

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,780
Tsunami!

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,060
What now?

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,310
--A tsunami's coming!
--What's going on, Luffy?!

44
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,800
Maybe it wasn't such
a good idea after all?

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,290
What wasn't a good idea?

46
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,190
I told him not to, but he said he
was so thirsty he couldn't stand it,

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,640
so he chomped down on some
cactus growing back there.

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
Cactus?

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,830
Yeah. Over there.

50
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,840
Those round things.

51
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,080
Eh?! Those are bad!

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,010
Those are mezcal cacti! They're
used to make hallucination drugs!

53
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,110
What?!

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,850
Oh no!

55
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,390
We're gonna drown!

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
Alright! Bring it on, if you dare!

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,520
I'll beat all of you up!

58
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,480
This is bad!

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,770
Gum-Gum...

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,560
Tranquilizer!

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,950
Way to go, Chopper!

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,150
Well? Do you see Nami's group?

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,410
L-Luffy?

64
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,430
What?!

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,940
Damn. We're completely
separated from them now.

66
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,020
And their footprints are disappearing.

67
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,130
Come to think of it, I haven't
seen Ace for a while, either.

68
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,720
When did he disappear?

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,140
I bet he got separated from us.

70
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,270
Sheesh! What a troublesome big brother!

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,290
We're the ones who got separated!

72
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,280
--All because of you!
--Quit acting so carefree!

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,130
What is it, Usopp?

74
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,110
Do you hear something?

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,860
A pirate ship?!

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,490
Aah! It's--!

77
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,080
Nami and Vivi've been caught!
Oh, and the camel.

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,200
What?!

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,210
--Hey! Luffy!
--Don't be rash!

80
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,330
Damn! Let's go, too!

81
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,170
Yeah!

82
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,670
Gum-Gum...

83
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,930
...Give-Me-Water!

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,890
Water?!

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,390
I'm out of strength...

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,850
Did I just hear something?

87
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,440
I wouldn't if I were you.

88
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,460
Oh, my bad!

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,930
I'm so thirsty I misjudged...

90
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,220
By the way, do you have any water?

91
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,420
You mean you didn't come to save us?!

92
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,610
I only came to get water.

93
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,100
Help, Luffy-san!
Lashes is about to be eaten!

94
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,440
That thing's edible?

95
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,660
We, the Barbar Sand Pirates, have a saying.

96
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,370
Saying?

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,330
Aside from friends, nothing alive
in the desert can't be eaten!

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,840
I'll even eat stuff off the ground!

99
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,010
That'll make you sick.

100
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,970
Then I'll be careful!

101
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,390
What a funny pipsqueak!

102
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,350
You're funny too! Well, let's eat!

103
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,500
Why?!

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,110
I'm Barbarossa, captain of
the Barbar Sand Pirates!

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Luffy, was it? I'm sorry for our
rough treatment of your friends.

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,080
It's just that we're all so hungry...

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,090
No, I don't mind!

108
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,910
That's not for you to say!

109
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:10,810
But, Captain! We don't have any
wood at all to repair our main mast!

110
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,630
Without a main mast,
we won't have enough thrust!

111
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,050
Yeah! Yeah! What're we gonna do?!

112
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,090
If we don't do something,

113
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,890
we're going to die like dogs
in the middle of this desert!

114
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,600
--We're gonna die like dogs!
--Huh?! What?!

115
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,660
--The Barbar Sand Pirates are gonna die!
--Huh?

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,780
We sand pirates are born
in sand pirate ships,

117
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,870
and we'll die in sand pirate ships!

118
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,880
Abandoning our ship is unthinkable!

119
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah! That's right! We'll die in our ship!

120
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,100
We'll die like dogs in our ship!

121
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,710
What is this?

122
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,910
That was fate, this was fate!

123
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,880
We sand pirates will never do
anything to defy the flow of sand!

124
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,890
Can't say I didn't warn you.

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,530
But there is timber at the Meriyasu Oasis.

126
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,620
Where is it?! I'll rush there real quick!

127
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,320
But the sands've changed lately.
It's dangerous for outsiders.

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm responsible for it! I'll do it!

129
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,380
Yeah?! You will?!

130
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,050
Bring back wood with this sand-sled.

131
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,020
I'd say this is more of
a canoe than a sled...

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,480
Zaba and Rasa will show you
to the Meriyasu Oasis.

133
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,630
--Rasa?
--Yes.

134
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,570
Rasa is our ship's finest sand-sledder.

135
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,010
A sand-sled can carry two people.
What'll you do?

136
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,450
I'll be fine on my own!

137
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,500
Come on, now! Quit saying
baseless things like that!

138
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,410
It'll probably be demanding work.
Want me to go with you?

139
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,770
Oh! That was cool, Rasa!

140
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,690
The others seem to be outsiders...
but you're from here.

141
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,860
Wow! How could she tell?

142
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,260
You must have some
experience with a sand-sled.

143
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,570
You'll come along.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,360
Vivi-chan can't do
anything that dangerous!

145
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,220
Yeah! That's crazy!

146
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,790
All right. I'll come with you.

147
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,320
Oh? So these go on top of
the sand? How does it work?

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,380
I'll pilot the sled.
I did this once long ago.

149
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,590
It's not too different from a ship.
This goes like this, right?

150
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,680
I-I'm back!

151
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,230
Don't waste your strength
doing stupid things!

152
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,840
You can rest there, Luffy-san.

153
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,160
Now, let's see. I believe
this goes like this and...

154
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,200
Ugh. Let's go, Zaba!

155
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,960
Yeah, Rasa!

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,610
Yahoo!

157
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,480
This feels great!

158
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,200
If we borrow this,
can't we reach Yuba right away?

159
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,550
It's hard to control sand-sleds.
It's not something easily mastered.

160
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,680
Then how come you can control it?

161
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,890
I used to practice with a sand-sled
I received when I was little.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,690
But what should we do while we wait?

163
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,720
Want to eat the camel?!

164
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,460
Yay! Yay! Yay!

165
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,730
All for it!

166
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,440
Just joking!

167
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,200
Doesn't sound like a joke to me...

168
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,280
Hey, you! What's the big idea?!

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,340
Hey, Rasa! That's--!

170
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,480
Hey, Vivi! We're getting
pulled in more and more!

171
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,890
It's quicksand! If we get
swallowed into the sand,

172
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,020
we'll never come back out!

173
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,620
Rasa. Wasn't that going too far?

174
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,130
If luck's on her side,
she'll make it through alive.

175
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,910
Huh? You know that girl?

176
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,070
Yeah. As if I'd ever forget!

177
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,000
You alright, Vivi?!

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,770
We're in trouble if we don't do something!

179
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,820
We're done for!

180
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,440
Vivi! Duck!

181
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,380
Gum-Gum...

182
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,040
Despite how he seems, you can
always count on Luffy in a pinch!

183
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,940
Yeah. But what concerns me
more is the desert's fickleness.

184
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,750
The desert's fickleness?

185
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,140
Yeah. The desert is honest.

186
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,800
A slight change in weather or
people's hearts will change it greatly.

187
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,120
A change in people's hearts?

188
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,060
What's that?

189
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,380
Boss! It's them!

190
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,600
They're coming!

191
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,060
--Turn to starboard! Hurry!
--Battle stations!

192
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,860
You wanna get in my way, too?

193
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,480
--There are so many of them!
--Who are they?

194
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,340
Desert bandits! Pests who're
always desperately fighting us!

195
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,300
Conflict seems imminent these days!
That has them on edge, too!

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,810
Looks like you can't move!
You're finally ours today!

197
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,480
Men! Don't let a single
one of them leave alive!

198
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,950
Our pleasure! Our pleasure!

199
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,900
What is this, a pub?

200
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,320
The desert has pit us together!

201
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,180
Will the desert choose us,
the Barbar Pirates, or you?!

202
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,750
Let's let the desert
decide our fate in battle!

203
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,500
Fool! Fool! The desert'd never choose you!

204
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,010
What's that?

205
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,680
--Grand Dung Beetle!
--There's a Grand Dung Beetle!

206
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,960
--Grand Dung Beetle?
--Say what now?!

207
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,180
Desert bugs that haul giant balls of dung!

208
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,150
No less than 100 people a year
are squished by their rolling dung!

209
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,480
Eh?!

210
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,000
Boss! It's headed right for our ship!

211
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,250
Leave it to me!

212
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,410
Thanks, guests...

213
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,730
We'll let you off easy this time!
Your lives are spared for now!

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,590
That deserves a
warm shower of applause.

215
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,990
Rasa! Don't you think
you went a little too far?!

216
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,040
--They're not following!
--That's fine!

217
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,860
If she won't come
however much we wait,

218
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,310
that's just the level of a person she is!

219
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,000
We caught up!

220
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,330
Yay!

221
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,180
This oasis is completely buried in sand.

222
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,140
It was once a flourishing city, but...

223
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,560
You've been here before?

224
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,150
The people of this city gave me
a small sand-sled as a memento.

225
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,730
That was a very long time ago, though.

226
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,090
I stopped by here once with my father

227
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,070
when he was traveling around the country.

228
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,690
I've been waiting all this time.

229
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,840
Back then, the king told us,

230
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,780
"If anything happens to this oasis,
I will come rushing to help.

231
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,740
The kingdom won't ignore any voice,
no matter how small."

232
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,690
So you were that girl!

233
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,860
Eventually, this oasis was
buried in sand and abandoned.

234
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,620
Every last person in town left.

235
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,550
Even so, I stayed behind
and waited for you.

236
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,790
I believed in you...

237
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,700
But the king never came. Nor you, of course.

238
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,930
That's because similar incidents
were happening all over the country

239
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,460
and the king was busy every
day trying to combat it!

240
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,810
I don't want to hear your excuses!

241
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,960
I waited all alone in the
middle of this vast desert!

242
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,720
Eventually, I couldn't
differentiate between dawn and dusk.

243
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,460
By the time Barbarossa took me in,
I couldn't feel anything,

244
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,660
not even the midday scorching heat
or the freezing cold after sunset.

245
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,290
The fact that I was even alive baffled me.

246
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,080
But, inside my head,
the king's words continue to ring.

247
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,060
Even now, I don't understand it.

248
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,230
Things were so difficult,
so what exactly was I waiting for?

249
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,850
Just what kept me going?

250
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,830
Hate? Anger? Or inexistent hope?

251
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,820
What was it?!

252
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,060
Someone tell me...

253
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,590
I'm sorry...

254
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,730
I'm so sorry for making you wait...

255
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm so sorry!

256
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,440
They sure ran off in a hurry!

257
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,690
Though it's too bad we didn't get
to swipe any of their food or water.

258
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,740
Sand pirates sure have it tough, too...

259
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,080
Everything living in this
desert has it the same.

260
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,370
Long ago, I used to feel this
desert belonged to everyone.

261
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,220
But when I think about it now,
I feel like that's a bit conceited.

262
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,510
Lately, I've come to think that
it might not belong to anyone.

263
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:36,690
That we're able to live freely
because it belongs to no one.

264
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,040
Do you think the sea is the same way?

265
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,690
Good question.

266
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,060
That's something you'll have
to find out for yourselves.

267
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,120
There it is! We made it!

268
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,050
Luffy! Where are you?!

269
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,020
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

270
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,070
I continue on to the ends of emotion

271
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,200
I scoop up my hands,

272
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,710
and the sand and time
that spills from them

273
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is
what I was born to do

274
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:56,640
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

275
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:08,570
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

276
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,240
no one knows about

277
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,170
--Say, Luffy. Where's your brother?
--Dunno.

278
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,090
He's worse at directions
than this guy?!

279
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,140
Huh?! Who're you
talking about, Pervy Cook?!

280
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,400
Who else is there besides you?

281
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,930
Hey! I got food and water!

282
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,520
--Big brother! How?!
--Got it from the rebel army!

283
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,760
Come again?!

284
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

285
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,650
"False Fortitude!
Camu, Rebel Soldier at Heart!"

286
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
