00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,940
"The Gold and Waver Recovery Operations!"

18
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,030
All right, then! Here we go, guys! Ready?!

19
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,020
Yeah!

20
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,240
Wait, wait! Wait, you guys!

21
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,950
What's wrong, Usopp?

22
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,780
Geez, you guys! Are you just gonna go
without thinking this over?!

23
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,080
This doesn't bode well at all.

24
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,170
Seven people running around will
stand out way too much!

25
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,630
That's true, come to think of it.

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,600
And even though it is disguised,I'm
worried about Merry!

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah, given this level of quality.

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,710
They'll notice, even though it's so perfect?!

29
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,960
There's such a thing as worrying too much.

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,940
No one's gonna take this junky--

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,920
Don't call it junk! Besides,that
isn't the issue here!

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,480
Honestly! I'm the only onewho
considers the unexpected!

33
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,950
There's no doubt it's gonna getsunk
the next time it's spotted!

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,660
Plus... Nami!

35
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,320
Huh? Me?!

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,500
What happened to the Waver?!

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,430
Oh, no! I left it hidden in some grass!

38
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,130
See what I mean!

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,200
My bad!

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,910
Forgetful Nami-san is lovely, too!

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,870
Well, stupidity aside...

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,270
All right, men. I'll now
explainthe plan. So listen good!

43
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,480
Tadah!

44
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,940
Okay, gentlemen!

45
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,860
I'll now explain the plan!First,
the gold recovery team!

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,230
This will consist of Luffy, Zoro,Robin,
and me, Captain Usopp-sama!

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,470
And the Waver recovery team
willconsist of Nami and one other!

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,770
Sanji!

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,490
Nice plan, Usopp!

50
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,710
Let's work hard, okay?!

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,860
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,660
Dumbass eyebrows.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
What was that?!

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,260
Hey, Usopp! Are you leaving
mealone with the ship again?!

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,210
Don't worry!

56
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,160
Merry's completely disguised,so
you can almost rest easy!

57
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,220
Almost?!

58
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,570
Plus, who's gonna tend to
ourinjuries if something happens?!

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,690
Super Doctor!

60
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,580
You dummy! Praising mewon't
help you, you jerk!

61
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,440
Listen. Here's where we are now.

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,440
The gold recovery teamwill
avoid all regular routes

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,580
and take the shortest path alongthe
coast to the storage vault.

64
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,540
Nami. Do you rememberwhere you hid the Waver?

65
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,060
Yes. By the bay on theeastern
side of the island.

66
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,400
At the base of the rim... Right around here.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,720
Almost the exact opposite side...

68
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,770
It'll take too long to go by land...

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,770
Yes! Right there!

70
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,880
Nami! You two rush across
the bay in that boat!

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,830
And we'll all meet back
here,at the Going Merry!

72
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,720
Right!

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,170
Huh? You're still there? You can leave now...

74
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,430
The head chef has ordered me to stand watch

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,310
until you've eaten everything on your plate!

76
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,980
Even if you dine in yourprivate
quarters, rules are rules!

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,120
You must eat every last bite!

78
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,390
That lousy Jessica...

79
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,770
You too, General!

80
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,850
Eh?!

81
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,980
We've prepared plenty for you!

82
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,400
Please eat up!

83
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,240
You don't like broccoli either, General?

84
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,030
No, for me, it's tomatoes and carrots...

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,570
Oh! Lieutenant Commander!

86
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,390
Oh, are you eating? I'll
come back later, then.

87
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,140
No, no! This is an exception!You
came at just the right time!

88
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,630
Sir?

89
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,650
I was just about to call for you!

90
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,150
O-Oh...

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,760
Commander! I apologize for letting theStraw
Hats escape three separate times!

92
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,470
Oh, that doesn't matter right
now!Say, have you eaten yet?

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,520
--No...--That's not good! Not good at all!

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,340
You can't fight on an empty stomach!

95
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,850
In fact, it's your duty as
ahigh-ranking officer to eat first!

96
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,020
It's harder for lower-rankingpeople
to eat otherwise!

97
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,820
Right...

98
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,190
There's no need to act
reserved! Eat right up!

99
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,600
Tell her it was exceptionally delicious!

100
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,670
Understood.

101
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,080
I'll crush you fools and
this hedgehog in no time flat!

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,780
Look forward to it, you damn commander!

103
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,040
"Justice"

104
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,650
It's almost time...

105
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,520
Looks like we'll need
to reorganize our units.

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,810
So the plan is to hurry aheadof
them and block their path?

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,790
Yes. General, contact each unit immediately.

108
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,420
Yes, sir!

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,870
Attention, all warshipson
standby! Urgent orders!

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Monitor the area aroundthe
Sea Gate and the bay!

111
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,240
What about my unit?

112
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,080
Send your men to the Sea Gateas
soon as they've finished eating.

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,140
Understood!

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,250
You!

115
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,190
Why, hello there, Condoriano-- Oh, pardon me.

116
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,060
I mean, Special Inspector Major Shepherd!

117
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,420
Commander Jonathan. I hear youlet
the Straw Hat pirates escape.

118
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,870
Not at all. They are likely
stillhiding inside this fortress.

119
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,570
Oh? And you can eat a leisurelymeal
knowing that, huh?!

120
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,840
You must not have a care in the world!

121
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,770
It's no wonder they secretly
callyou a peace-addict hedgehog.

122
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,400
No, think nothing of it.

124
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,470
So, I assume you know whatthey're
sneaking around for?

125
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,090
For the most part.

126
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,160
I believe they'll come back toretrieve
some gold they forgot about.

127
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,880
Gold, huh?

128
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,700
Still, we've certainly declinedfrom
our former dauntless selves.

129
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,120
Major. If you have anysage
advice, might I ask for it?

130
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,950
I could put you in charge of anespecially
skilled unit if you'd like...

131
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,960
Don't be absurd.

132
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,190
You know you're the most worthyto
command this "skilled unit."

133
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,630
Incidentally, where are the menwho
mistook me for a Straw Hat?

134
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,660
Why do you want to know that?

135
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,780
So I can court martial them, naturally.

136
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,540
It was I who gave the orders tocapture
all suspicious people on sight.

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,230
All they did was follow those orders.

138
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,830
Am I a suspicious person?

139
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,700
Under
those circumstances.

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,660
We seem to have a conflict of views.

141
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,850
I've just remembered something I need to do.

142
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,790
I'll return here once I'm done.

143
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,550
Commander. Will you be all right?!

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,330
He's a proud HQ inspector whoinsists
that G8 is wholly unnecessary.

145
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,660
He would never takecommand
of this branch base.

146
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,340
That wasn't what I meant!

147
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,020
Now, then.

148
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,680
Prepare to dispatch the
mostpowerful squad in all of G8!

149
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,020
Not more of your jokes...

150
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,980
I am serious.

151
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,490
Those damn fools...

152
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,330
Hey!

153
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,830
The Stan Marey entered portthis
morning-- where's its captain?!

154
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,670
Sir! He's been in the
infirmary this entire time!

155
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,800
The infirmary?! What's he doing there?!

156
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,290
Apparently, many of his crew were injured,

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,340
so he's probably there
out of concern for them.

158
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,840
Call him here! Right now!

159
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,680
Yes, sir!

160
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,840
He said they're after gold...

161
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,250
And there's only one placein
this fortress that could be!

162
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,890
Just you watch, you worthless commander!

163
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,950
I'll catch that Straw Hat myselfand
crush this entire fortress!

164
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,720
I hope everyone is all right...

165
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,140
I'm so lonely!

166
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,010
The stars! The moon!

167
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,760
And I'm all alone with Nami-san in
a boat beneath them!

168
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,320
What a wonderful situation!I
feel like I'm dreaming!

169
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,780
The warships in the bay are moving!

170
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,020
What are they doing? I havea
bad feeling about this!

171
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,720
Sanji-kun! Go faster!

172
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,310
Yes! As you wish!

173
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,320
Oh, but row quietly!

174
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,860
You got it!

175
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,570
All clear on the left and right...

176
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,410
There's no telling wherethere
could be soldiers,

177
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,250
so we gotta move around unnoticed!

178
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,200
It'll be a miracle if we don't get noticed!

179
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,310
Long-nose! We'll be fine for a while.

180
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,210
Why couldn't you say so sooner?!

181
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,340
What are you sleeping for?!

182
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,540
Get your act together, will ya?!

183
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,890
He has no sense of tension at all...

184
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,550
Commander.

185
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,850
Placing units all along the bay
willleave the base itself undermanned.

186
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,690
It can't be helped.

187
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,650
Against this adversary,cautiousness
amounts to nothing.

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,490
But having them prance around as
ifthey own the place is a bit much.

189
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,770
What do you say we mobilize the new recruits?

190
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,450
No. It's too dangerous for them.

191
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,060
I thought you might say that,so
I kept it quiet until now,

192
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,960
but many have actuallyalready
volunteered to do it.

193
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,800
They are already members of our forces,

194
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,320
and have the same feelings offondness
for this fortress as we do!

195
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,560
Is that so?

196
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,660
In that case, order themto
observe and report only--

197
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,530
no getting involved.

198
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,190
Yes, sir! I'm sure they'll be delighted!

199
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,190
By the by. I have one otherrequest
for you, General...

200
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,120
Yes?

201
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,790
What?! That's insane!

202
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,290
The Stan Marey is crippled andstill
being repaired as we speak!

203
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,050
That doesn't mean every ship inyour
fleet is out of commission.

204
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,670
That's true, but there are
soldierswho still can't even walk

205
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,280
after the storm we ran into on our way here!

206
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,800
Captain. Are you arguing with me,

207
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,760
a special inspector dispatched from HQ?

208
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,280
N-No, it's not like that... But...

209
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,770
Then gather all your men!

210
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
Half will stay with me;

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,660
the rest will board the
Pinepeakand wait for my orders!

212
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm gonna show this useless
fortress'fools the power of Navy HQ!

213
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,440
Hey! Zoro! You keepin' up?!

214
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,430
Just shut up, will ya?!

215
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,930
Robin! Are we almost there yet?

216
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,730
Just a little more.

217
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,020
Is it really there?!

218
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,540
There's only a door!

219
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,160
Yes, assuming the map is correct.

220
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,140
Then the vault is behind there?!

221
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes. Breaking in through thereshould
be the shortest route!

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,520
Then it's decided!We've
got no choice but to go!

223
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:33,000
All right! Let's do this
thing! Usopp Aa-aa-aa!

224
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,430
All right!

225
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,170
All right!

226
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,470
Let's go, Usopp!

227
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,030
Eh?!

228
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,970
"Aaahhhhhh!"

229
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,120
W-We're gonna crash!

230
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,590
Usopp. Don't get left behind.

231
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,860
Say, wanna do that again?!

232
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,710
Screw that! I'm never doing that again!

233
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,870
All right! No marines!

234
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,910
Pardon the intrusion!

235
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,250
Nami-san. Watch your step.

236
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,120
Thanks.

237
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,190
We can't afford to cause an uproar.

238
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,120
Looks like our only choiceis
to go along the coast now.

239
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,380
There's no time for us
tobe dealing with marines!

240
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,780
Sanji-kun! Let's hurry!

241
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,170
Okay!

242
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,440
We're almost there, men! Push forward!

243
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,380
I see it!

244
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,430
It's right down there!

245
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,800
The vault is at the end here!

246
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,720
All right! I'm coming for you, gold!

247
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,470
We made it here so
easily.Something's not right...

248
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,840
All right!

249
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,770
P-Pirates!

250
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,180
Y-You're not going any further!

251
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,620
Knock it off. We're notplannin'
to do anything crazy,

252
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,100
like destroy the fortress or slaughter you.

253
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,270
Quiet! As disrupters of
peace,you have to be punished!

254
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,140
We just told you, we're
not gonna do anything!

255
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,530
Like I can really believe some pirates!

256
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,830
We are proud to protect these
waters,together with our commander!

257
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,120
In other words, you're trying to
say you'll risk your life?

258
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,700
Obviously!

259
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,860
Then go eat a lot and train some damn more!

260
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,440
What is this?! Awesome!

261
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,510
That's quite heavy security.

262
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,600
Yeah, this is definitely
theperfect place to hide gold!

263
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,200
I bet there's lots of other goodstuff
in there besides our gold!

264
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,970
So, what do we do?

265
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,120
Gum-Gum Pistol!

266
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,760
Sorry, Zoro.

267
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,060
Hey!

268
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,090
Sorry...

269
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,170
Brute strength won't open it!

270
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,170
With this vault, you turn these
dials,and when the numbers match,

271
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,900
the gears above turn, the boltscome
undone, and the door opens!

272
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Got that, lady and gentlemen?!

273
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,690
That's far enough!

274
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,130
So they were waiting for us.

275
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,620
It would seem so.

276
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,410
You're trapped like rats!Give
yourselves up quietly!

277
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,220
Do so now and--

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,490
What proud, great pirates would ever give up

279
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,770
when there's treasure right in front of 'em?!

280
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,020
They're all yours now!

281
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,090
Hey!

282
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,640
Damn you pirates!

283
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,190
How dare you?! Fire!

284
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,980
Usopp! Take care of the vault!

285
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,820
Consider it taken care of!

286
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,150
Well, Long-nose? Can you handle it?

287
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,060
This is really Nami's specialty,

288
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,350
but a lock of this levelis
a piece of cake for me!

289
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,400
All right!

290
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,000
First one!

291
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,240
W-What?!

292
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,070
It's instant death if those hit you.

293
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,620
They come off?!

294
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,040
One slip-up, and my headcould get smashed in!

295
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,590
Gum-Gum Pistol!

296
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,290
Now!

297
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,770
Luffy! Don't stretch your armsout
too much! They'll cut 'em!

298
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,340
Right!

299
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,260
Yes! The second one!

300
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,280
Lt. Commander. All ships arenow
at their designated locations.

301
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,710
Good! Tell them to wait
as-isuntil orders are given!

302
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,030
Yes, sir!

303
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,490
Fifty more minutes...

304
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,230
I surrender!

305
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,960
Nice, Robin!

306
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,970
I'm surrounded...

307
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,260
Treinta Fleurs!

308
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,850
They just keep on coming!There's
no end to 'em!

309
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,920
Usopp! Is it open yet?!

310
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,300
It's open!

311
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,790
Yes!

312
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,960
Damn you!

313
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,250
Whoa!

314
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,170
All hands, retreat!

315
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,160
Wow! This vault is so neat!

316
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,690
What?!

317
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,730
There's no gold at all!

318
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,300
I won't let you escape
from Navarone so easily.

319
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Hurry up and get moving towards the future!

320
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Let's move ahead, pursuing our dreams

321
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:46,290
All the answers are right here, pouring out

322
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,820
Rush forth, rush forth,
