2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,070
Luffy and his friends
chased after a big beetle

50
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,110
which appeared suddenly during their journey,

51
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,650
in order to recruit him, and in doing
so they reached an unknown island.

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,450
Alright, you giant beetle! Join my...

53
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,240
My boss...

54
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,210
...will never become...

55
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,290
...a pirate!

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,000
With this beetle as their guardian angel,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,070
Yoko, a girl who hates pirates and...

58
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,770
...the people from the same ocean
live on this island called...

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,010
This is Kansorn Island where people
from the East Blue live together!

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,230
It also known as Little East Blue!

61
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,730
Meanwhile, the Amigo Pirates, working on
orders from the legendary pirate Shiki...

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,860
...are heading to Kansorn Island as well!

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,050
"A Special Presentation Related to the
Movie! Little East Blue in Danger!"

64
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,470
Reefs surround the island. It's
too dangerous to speed up.

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,910
Ready?

66
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,140
Nami-sama!

67
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,480
Over here! It's this way!

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,020
What the... hell...

69
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,990
L-Look at her! Nami-sama in
person is there in front of us!

70
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,130
She's mega cute, way more
than the wanted poster!

71
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,410
I can't help crying! I'm
so happy to be alive!

72
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,170
Yeah, yeah!

73
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,630
W-Who are you people?

74
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,080
Thank you for asking!

75
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,630
We're members of the unofficial
Nami-sama fan club...

76
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,010
Known as Orenami Group!

77
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,890
Orenami?

78
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,350
Yes! L...!

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,010
O...!

80
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,970
V...!

81
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,180
E...!

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,410
We love you! Nami-sama!

83
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,600
Stop it! That's so irritating!

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,120
Take me to see Luffy, already!

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,620
Yes, it's our pleasure, Nami-sama!

86
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,620
For God's sake...

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Can you stop calling me Nami-sama?

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,260
Yes, Nami-sama!

89
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,630
Ah! Feels great!

90
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,170
This is awesome!

91
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,490
Do you like it?

92
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,640
You're from Windmill Village so
they must be familiar to you.

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,390
Yeah, but none of ours were this big!

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,860
That windmill is like a
symbol for Little East Blue.

95
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,320
See? This is the training hall!

96
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,250
Hmmm...

97
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,590
I’m here to challenge you!

98
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,280
Against me?

99
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,520
Sure.

100
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,980
My 2001st win.

101
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,210
Man... Bad memories.

102
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,340
Lunch break is over! Let's
start afternoon lessons!

103
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,010
Okay!

104
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,300
Ouch! Please!

105
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,440
H-H-H-He wants to challenge us!

106
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,120
Hey! He's not a challenger!

107
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,410
Take a good look! He's
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro-san!

108
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,760
Wow! Really? Amazing!

109
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,920
Can I have your autograph?!

110
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,360
How pathetic!

111
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,270
This looks just like Kaya's mansion!

112
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,960
This brings back memories!

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,690
She'd always poke her head
out of the window upstairs...

114
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,680
--Usopp-san!
--Hey, Kaya!

115
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,320
Did I keep you waiting?

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,910
So what adventure are you
going to tell me today?

117
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,630
Hmm, let’s see…

118
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,780
The story of when I fought the
giant goldfish at the South Pole

119
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,800
when I was five!

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Goldfish?

121
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Yeah! What first shocked me was
the immense size of its poop!

122
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,970
It was so big that I landed on
it, thinking it was solid ground!

123
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,350
I wonder how she's doing...

124
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,170
Wow, it's so thin!

125
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,970
W-What's wrong here?!

126
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,310
I heard that Luigia who lives here

127
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,050
built this in the style of the
mansion that she used to live in.

128
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,080
N-N-No way! It wasn't like this!

129
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,720
But maybe...

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,790
if she used to live in the mansion
that means she's a relative of Kaya?

131
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,430
D-Don't tell me that you're K-Kaya?

132
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,070
Who is she?! Who is she! Who is...

133
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,500
You're a member of the Straw Hats, right?

134
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,960
Yeah, I cook for them.

135
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,170
Where did you learn to cook?

136
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,180
At an on-the-sea restaurant in
the East Blue for several years.

137
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,430
The Baratie?!

138
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,900
Are you really from the Baratie?!

139
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,140
K-Kind of...

140
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,280
That's great! I'm thrilled!

141
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,870
I fell in love with dishes that Zeff cooks

142
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,820
and tried to steal some idea

143
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,960
s by going there often around
the time when it started.

144
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,070
Oh, really...

145
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,500
The building is similar, right?

146
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,170
I don't have Zeff's courage so I
couldn't imagine making it on the sea

147
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,170
but I still wanted as style similar to his.

148
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,040
Go ahead and try it.

149
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm sorry but I don't have any money...

150
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,060
No problem! Come on!

151
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh yeah?

152
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,260
Alright.

153
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,020
This must be...

154
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,440
Ouch!

155
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,530
Yes! I figured out how the
damn geezer cooks the dish!

156
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,900
How is it? Does it taste like Zeff's?

157
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,250
Yeah. In fact, you're better
than that old geezer!

158
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,180
Are you sure? I can't tell
you how happy that makes me!

159
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,390
Gee... even the cook seems happy!

160
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,370
So tiny...

161
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,610
Shut up!

162
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,070
So you're from Syrup Village?

163
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,660
Huh? Yeah.

164
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,270
You must be Yasopp's son.

165
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,950
You know him?!

166
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,370
Sort of. We had a lot of
troubles with his lying.

167
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,020
Dad? Oh, by the way,

168
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,170
did you really live in the mansion there?

169
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,680
You must know if you're from there!

170
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
That mansion is not only
the symbol of the village

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,650
but it's everybody's dream house!

172
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,560
Y-Yeah!

173
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,010
I always wanted to live in a mansion
like that since I was a kid.

174
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,230
I finally made my dream come after
I ended up being on this island.

175
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,820
So that means you're not
related to Kaya at all.

176
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,890
I'm known as a cranky princess here so don't

177
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,440
tell anybody if you don't wanna die!

178
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Yes, Ma'am!

179
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,190
Damn, even the granny is bonding with them?!

180
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,330
Oh, please watch your step there!

181
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,550
It's a strange place to walk through.

182
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,010
This is a maze made by nature!

183
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,590
Hmm.

184
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,490
It connected to different
parts of the island!

185
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,190
That's nice but, are we there yet?

186
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,430
Ah, we're almost there!

187
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,940
W-W-What the hell is this?!

188
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,240
It's the symbol of Orenami!

189
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,290
It was hard because we only
had the poster to draw from!

190
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,410
W-Well... I mean... Why is it naked?!

191
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,800
That was decided by consensus!

192
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,710
Don't worry! We made sure
to get the front, too!

193
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,100
That's enough!

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,720
Sorry...

195
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,180
Boss...

196
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
They're all stupid!

197
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,460
They let pirates on to the
island which you and my father

198
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,250
have always been protected!

199
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,190
I hate them! I hate them!

200
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,500
That tickles! Boss!

201
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,740
Stop it! Hey!

202
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,810
Alright, guys! Let's take this
thing to the legendary pirate Shiki

203
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,700
and become his brothers!

204
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,590
Remember, we're after the big beetle
that took off from Shiki's hide-out!

205
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,410
Do you understand?! Failure is not an option!

206
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,200
Be ready for anything!

207
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,580
Yeah!

208
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,720
Uh, sorry, Big Bro,

209
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,460
but you're the captain so you
better say something about...

210
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh no, he's in the middle of a siesta now!

211
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,640
Uh-oh! He's not gonna wake up for a while!

212
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,140
--You bastard!
--Don't do it, Colt-san!

213
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,390
You know what's gonna happen if you
wake him when he's having a siesta!

214
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,150
He's right! We don't wanna die yet!

215
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,900
How the hell could he take a nap at this
crucial moment for us Amigo Pirates!

216
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,660
We gotta do it without him
then! Are you ready, guys?!

217
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,910
Órale!

218
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay, it's done! We have a
steel cage for the beetle!

219
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,980
Amazing! It only took you a minute!

220
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,800
Huh! It's a piece of cake for me!

221
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,300
You're good!

222
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,390
We're ready for the beetle at any minute now!

223
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,100
Yeah! They might be back
with it at any minute!

224
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,710
Awesome!

225
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,980
It's a welcome party for you.

226
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,610
Mitsuboshi really wanted this to happen.

227
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,990
Everybody, dig in!

228
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,990
Cheers!

229
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,960
So good!

230
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,550
Having a party for pirates?
What're they thinking?!

231
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,300
--We're here!
--The town square is right there!

232
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,970
You kept saying we were "almost"
there but you made me walk for hours!

233
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,480
We wanted you to enjoy our
island to the full extent!

234
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,510
You're a pirate, too, right?

235
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,030
Even women are into pirates?
These are crazy times!

236
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,850
Humph! Everybody's into pirates!
These are crazy times!

237
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,830
Yoko! You can't talk to
Nami-sama like that...

238
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,250
Augh! Ouch! Stop it!

239
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,580
Oh, hey!

240
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm sorry, Nami-sama! Her father
was killed by pirates...

241
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,970
Oh...

242
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,770
What happened?!

243
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,040
Hey, everybody, I need your
attention! Yes, look at me!

244
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,840
We're Amigo Pirates! This
island is under siege!

245
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,920
If you don't wanna get killed,

246
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
let us have the beetle!

247
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,840
The beetle?! Why does he know about Boss?!

248
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,270
Couldn't you hear what I said?

249
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,900
How about these?

250
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,950
W-What's this?! What's going on here?!

251
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,880
I don't know!

252
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,790
No! Don't go to them!

253
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,430
W-What's going on?!

254
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,760
I heard that the big beetle
is protecting this island!

255
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,440
But if he has nobody to protect, there'll
be no reason for him to stay here!

256
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
Don't you think so?

257
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,860
They want Boss!

258
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,030
No, Boss! Stay there! Don't show yourself!

259
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,180
My restaurant...

260
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,290
They destroyed it!

261
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,060
Old man!

262
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,810
Are you okay?

263
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,980
Y-Yeah.

264
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,810
I represent this island's inhabitants.

265
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,610
Is that so? Then where's the beetle?

266
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry but you can't have him!

267
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,890
Instead, you can have all
our money and food and

268
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,070
everything on this island!

269
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,330
Just take it all and go away!

270
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,340
Oh, believe me, we intend to do
so! We intend to take everything!

271
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,030
Money, food, and the beetle as well!

272
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,900
Whew! Couldn't eat another bite!

273
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,680
W-Who the heck are you? What're you doing?!

274
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,140
Hey, you, Fancy Hat! Go home!

275
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,990
W-What?!

276
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,640
The giant beetle doesn't
want to join a pirate crew!

277
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Just give up on him!

278
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,320
What?! Join the crew?!
You got me wrong, stupid!

279
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,570
I'm here to catch him!

280
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,910
Oh no!

281
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,120
That's not gonna work on me.

282
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,130
I'm a rubberman!

283
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,260
A Devil Fruit eater?!

284
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,010
Gum-Gum...

285
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,300
...Whip!

286
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,220
Zoro! Sanji!

287
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,600
--Alright!
--We got it!

288
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,850
They're coming!

289
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,280
Do you wanna fight more, Fancy Hat?!

290
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,150
That beetle's gonna fight me again tomorrow!

291
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm not gonna let you ruin that!

292
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,740
Mucho Needle Net!

293
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,380
Ow, ow, ow... Ouch!

294
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,790
Luffy!

295
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:52,010
Amore! My beloved brother Colt!

296
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,430
What a shame!

297
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,920
Even if you are a rubberman,

298
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,150
I will not let you get away with it, senor!

299
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,600
Yeah! That's my Big Bro!

300
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Boo-hoo-hoo, so melancholy!

301
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,980
What's this?!

302
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Luffy is captured by Largo.

303
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,210
Zoro and Sanji also struggle against
the powers of the Net-Net Fruit.

304
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,840
And when the beetle learns that
it is the pirates' target,

305
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,010
it makes a grave decision in
order to protect the island.

306
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,390
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,060
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
The Fierce Onslaught of the Amigo Pirates!"

308
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
