2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,730
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

51
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,210
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,460
who has been captured by the Navy.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,660
This is your punishment.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,710
There is no way to neutralize the
amount of poison you have absorbed!

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,580
What do you think you're doing to...

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,430
...Bon-chan?!

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,180
Leave Bon-chan...

58
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,790
...alone!

59
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,550
After fighting the Army Wolves,
Luffy and Bon Clay lost consciousness

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:22,390
and a mysterious man named Inazuma
rescued them and took them to...

61
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,340
Welcome to...

62
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,310
...Impel Down--Level 5.5!

63
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,590
It's a secret garden for prisoners!

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
New Kama Land!

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,050
Heehaw!

66
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,010
"Luffy's Treatment Begins!
Ivan-san's Miraculous Power!"

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,750
Yeah! Yo! Wow!

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,670
Ah hey! Hey!

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

70
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,420
Third district, third district, wow!

71
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,220
Fourth district, fourth district, wow!

72
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,290
Gay district, gay district, wow!

73
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,320
You're wonderful!

74
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,290
Heehaw!

75
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,410
Heehaw!

76
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,800
Is he...

77
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,190
Heehaw! Haw!

78
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,460
...Ivan-san?!

79
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,450
I got a little too excited...

80
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm starting to get a little dizzy...

81
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,380
Ivan-sama, are you alright?

82
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,860
I'm gonna... collapse...

83
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,090
...Or not!

84
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,930
That was a joke?!

85
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,640
You sure fooled me!

86
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,220
You're Ivan-san, aren't you?!

87
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,430
Oh dear!

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,970
Do you know about me?!

89
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,900
Hey! Calling him Ivan-san
is so disrespectful!

90
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,120
She's right!

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,930
He's the king of New Kama Ivan-sama!

92
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,260
Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama!

93
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,740
Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama!

94
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama...

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,200
Hush, now, candies!

96
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,670
Don't sweat the small stuff!

97
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,560
It's just a little thing!

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
They can call me whatever they want!

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,290
Even "Dooky" is fine!

100
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,430
No, don't call me "Dooky!"

101
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,910
Then why did you say it?!

102
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,640
You got me again!

103
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,570
H-He is the miracle-worker?!

104
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,010
The one that I worshipped for so long?!

105
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,470
Not "Dooky!"

106
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,110
Emporio Ivankov!

107
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,450
You were the queen of
Kamabakka Kingdom, weren't you?!

108
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,700
15 years ago, my father who was
once king of a country himself...

109
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,460
...went to Kamabakka Kingdom and...

110
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,760
...came back as a queer!

111
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,430
Aak!

112
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,590
Because the king became a queer,

113
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,370
both his country and family were ruined

114
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,160
and I fell from my princely status
to become a lowly pirate!

115
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm glad to have found you!

116
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,410
You'll pay the price for ruining my life!

117
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,670
No! No!

118
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,130
Don't do that! Where did you get that thing?!

119
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,590
Watch it!

120
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,760
I said "watch it!"

121
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,980
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

122
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,230
If I get shot, I'm gonna...

123
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,690
I'm gonna die...

124
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,680
...Or not!

125
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,220
You're such a character!

126
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,050
You were pulling my leg?!

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,410
Death Wink!

128
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,720
Yes! That's how Ivan-sama blinks!

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,110
Death Wink!

130
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,940
He was able to turn back that
bullet with only a wink?!

131
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,960
Emporio Female Hormone!

132
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,710
What did you do?!

133
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,210
You bastard! Don't tell me it's...

134
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,110
Your father wanted to become a woman!

135
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,320
What's wrong with that?!

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh no!

137
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm gonna lose it!

138
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,460
Two mothers and one daughter!

139
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,600
What's wrong with that?!

140
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,530
It's your family!

141
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,270
No! Please don't...

142
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,500
...do it!

143
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,750
What?!

144
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,610
What happened?

145
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,930
Way to go!

146
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,470
You can become a woman or a man,

147
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,110
heehaw!

148
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,580
Even a fairy!

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,520
You can become whoever you want!

150
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,840
Don't you think so?!

151
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,090
The border called gender!

152
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,070
I... No, everyone here,

153
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,970
heehaw!

154
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,280
We've all crossed that border!

155
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,960
So we're the new human race!

156
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,110
New Kama!

157
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,330
This is the garden of freedom -

158
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,410
New Kama Land!

159
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,030
Heehaw!

160
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,910
Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama!

161
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,760
Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama! Ivan-sama!

162
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,330
He transformed a man into a woman!

163
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,210
He is a miracle-worker! What great power!

164
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,570
Welcome to our New Kama Land!

165
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,680
Heehaw!

166
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,430
I'm so embarrassed!

167
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,280
Heehaw! She's embarrassed!

168
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,870
She's still got a long way to go
to become a New Kama!

169
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,660
Bon boy?

170
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,710
The miracle-worker, Emporio Ivankov!

171
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,550
It's my honor to meet you!

172
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,210
I'm glad to see you! I'm so glad!

173
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,050
If you don't mind, I have a favor to ask you!

174
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,050
A favor?

175
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,130
Can you save my friend's life?!
He was poisoned by Magellan!

176
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,230
No antidote can help him and he's just dying!

177
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,730
I'll do anything for you if you'll save him!

178
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,730
Are you talking about Straw boy?

179
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,560
Bon boy?

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,260
Huh?

181
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,720
Do you know why you've been treated already?

182
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,250
Oh yeah! When did you do it?!

183
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,490
We're just prisoners!

184
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,200
We don't just take in and
care for anyone who we find injured.

185
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,610
We're just not that nice!

186
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,100
I treated you because Straw boy begged me to.

187
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,860
Straw-chan begged you?!

188
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,550
We've been watching you guys on the monitor.

189
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,970
Straw boy,

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,850
I can't believe that you made it this far.

191
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,530
I've never seen people as lucky as you guys!

192
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,250
Bon...

193
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
Bon...

194
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,300
Bon-chan tried to help me

195
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,530
and got bitten by the wolves!

196
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,080
Take care of him!

197
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,650
I beg you! He's my friend!

198
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,170
You wouldn't say something
like that when you're dying.

199
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,140
So some friendships can't
be ruined even in a prison.

200
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,680
When someone begs you like that,

201
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,530
you gotta do it unless you're
a demon in human skin.

202
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,850
Straw-chan!

203
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,930
I already began the treatment
of Straw boy 10 hours ago!

204
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,520
Really?!

205
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,840
But, in a rough way...

206
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,820
Hey! Those of you born after the 90's!

207
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,090
These are old-fashioned bamboo stilts!

208
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,820
You gotta try these! It's fun!

209
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,490
I mean, I made these with wax,

210
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,550
so we should call them wax stilts!

211
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,530
How much longer can they keep this up?!

212
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,350
Go away now!

213
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,430
It's not good!

214
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,100
We gotta get off of this floor
in order to lose them!

215
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,290
Just keep running!

216
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,900
Tell me somebody! Where's the exit?!

217
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,450
What's going on here?!
Is this the treatment?!

218
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,510
He's been screaming for 10 hours
since we put him in this chamber.

219
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,160
It'll be two more days before he is treated.

220
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,910
What?!

221
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,070
10 years of your life.

222
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:06,110
I'll have to use 10 years of
your future for this treatment,

223
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,560
Straw boy.

224
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,070
Alright!

225
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,290
But there's no guarantee
that it's gonna save your life.

226
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,970
Now you have no chance of survival

227
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,200
and all I can do is give you
a 2 to 3% chance for survival.

228
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,630
And then it's up to your spirit,

229
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,530
if it's possible or impossible
for you to survive.

230
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,890
If the poison takes over, you will die.

231
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,680
But if spirit wins out

232
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,830
you will survive!

233
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,800
Alright now, have a nice trip to...

234
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,030
...the valley of the shadow of death!

235
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,900
Emporio...

236
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,320
...Healing Hormone!

237
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,120
10... 10 hours?!

238
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,630
Straw-chan has been screaming
like this for 10 hours?!

239
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,580
Spirits and hormones,

240
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,470
these are the vital forces of the human body.

241
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,850
They bring out the power to heal oneself!

242
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,580
I have drawn out his latent
immunity and changed his body...

243
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,430
...to enable him to battle
with the deadly poison.

244
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,490
There is a lot of destruction and recovery

245
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,050
raging at an extraordinary
speed inside of his body.

246
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,250
He will survive only if he can
make it through the pain!

247
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,780
W-What?!

248
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,820
You can take a look inside if you want.

249
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,860
Where... Where is it?!

250
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,690
Straw-chan...?

251
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,840
H-He's gonna die!

252
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,990
It's gonna tear up his body and
it's gonna be all messed up and...

253
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,440
No, he's already dead!

254
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,450
How could you?!

255
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,430
Help Straw-chan! Please! Help him!

256
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,750
Untie the chains and stop him bleeding!

257
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,530
T-That's horrible! Please!

258
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,350
Please do something!

259
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,220
Shut up!

260
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,770
I'm helping him now!

261
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,210
Don't underestimate human life!

262
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,690
Huh?!

263
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Don't you know what it takes to
strive against one's own mortality?!

264
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,460
I'm not the God or Buddha!

265
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,000
A miracle-worker?!

266
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,620
You can call me whatever you want, but...

267
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,790
...I could never save a fool who
only depends on other people.

268
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,570
I saved an impoverished country

269
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,040
and a country that was defeated in war

270
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,000
but all I did was draw
out their spirit to live.

271
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,090
Miracles only happen to
people who don't give up!

272
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,090
Don't underestimate miracles!

273
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,710
Ace!

274
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,520
THE PUBLIC EXECUTION OF ACE IS IN...

275
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,150
...16 HOURS!

276
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,910
Luffy fights the poison treatment himself.

277
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,470
The chance of survival is so slim,
it would be a miracle for him to survive.

278
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,180
Trusting his friend,
Bon Clay continues to cheer for his survival.

279
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,180
And then, the time of Ace's
execution is finally at hand.

280
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

281
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,430
"Believe in Miracles!
Bon Clay's Cries from the Heart!"

282
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
