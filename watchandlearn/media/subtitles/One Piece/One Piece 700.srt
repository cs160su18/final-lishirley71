00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
We're still far from our goal

Feels like the strength of my resolve is

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,150
put to the test everyday

Hey Let's go

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,620
The world I got out into is wild and lawless

hikari no saki Make my day

69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,750
All the pirates who are after the One Piece...

70
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,450
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,580
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,670
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

74
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,620
and his friends venture into that sea.

75
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,610
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

76
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,420
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

77
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,570
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance with

78
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,480
Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa.

79
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,570
But caught up in the current king Doflamingo's agenda,

80
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,410
they were trapped in the Birdcage along with the entire island.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,490
On top of that, he put prices on the heads of

82
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,000
Luffy and 11 others, and now they're being hunted by all the citizens.

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,190
And with the Straw Hats fighting
the Don Quixote Family fiercely,

84
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,690
Luffy and Law finally clash with Doflamingo
at the Royal Palace!

85
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,210
We are birds of a feather.

86
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,350
We Navy and Doflamingo are both out of place.

87
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,290
The Navy will never be a hero
in this country.

88
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,060
If somebody notices that's what you're thinking...

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,190
No.

90
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,320
I was just being blocked by you...

91
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,370
It's like a gamble.

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm sort of a lucky man.

93
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,180
King Riku-sama!
What are we supposed to do?!

94
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,070
If you tell us to fight, we'll take up arms!

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,800
--King Riku-sama!
--We'll follow you!

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Shall we wait... for a while?

97
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,430
What? Wait?

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,020
It won't be too late to choose death.

99
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,300
Did you think you could take me down?

100
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,030
The fact that shitty brats like you guys got conceited

101
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,800
and thought even for a second, that you could defeat me is...

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,530
...an unbearable humiliation to me!

103
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,260
Listen.

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,460
I'm a descendent of the noblest bloodlines in the world...

105
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,870
The Celestial Dragon!

106
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,540
We're admirable just by the fact of our birth.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,180
I used to possess the most unobtainable power
in the world.

108
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,650
Father! Where are the slaves-eh?!
Let's go buy some-eh!

109
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,860
Father, why don't they fall down on their knees-eh?

110
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,280
Father! Why do they come after us-eh?!

111
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,690
They're a Celestial Dragon family! Don't kill them...

112
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,040
Make them suffer for the rest of their lives!

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,650
By the age of ten,
I'd seen heaven and hell on earth.

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,090
Then, I killed my father
who caused all that

115
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,430
and returned to Mariejois with his head!

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,140
But...

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,730
...the Celestial Dragons in heaven
would never accept a renegade family!

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,770
I knew there was no way to get out of this hell.

119
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,640
I swore to myself at that moment.

120
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,500
That I will destroy...

121
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,990
...every single thing in the world
that they dominate!

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,070
The life I've lived was
on a very different level from yours!

123
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,810
I have no time to play around...

124
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,310
...with you brats!

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,410
"The Ultimate Power!
The Secret of the Op-Op Fruit!"

126
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,150
A town located in
the Northwest part of Dressrosa - Primula.

127
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,890
PRIMULA - THE NORTHWESTERN TOWN

128
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,690
W-W-Wait a minute!

129
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,680
Honey...!

130
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,210
P-Please!

131
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,030
D-Don't do it! I'm begging you!

132
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,950
Please!

133
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,350
I don't wanna do this!

134
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,390
But I can't... I can't control my body!

135
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Sorry! I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

136
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,380
With this much stuff,
we can rebuild our ship-yashi!

137
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,840
Deshi, deshi!

138
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,240
Wait, damn pirates!

139
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,910
What're you guys doing
under the cover of fire?!

140
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,730
--Oh no!
--Deshi!

141
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,370
Don't just stand there! Let's run!

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,730
I won't let you get away!

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
You can't catch us!

144
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,690
Stop!

145
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,830
--No-way-poo!
--Puppuku-poo!

146
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,790
Shoot tranquilizer bullets!

147
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,780
They got excited by the fire?
Or do they sense something?

148
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,700
Damn! We're already short-handed!

149
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,330
It's gonna die if we don't stop it!

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,500
Tranquilizer bullets!
Do we still have any?!

151
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,380
What's going on?!

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,820
You people are the Navy, aren't you?!

153
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,180
Do something about this situation!
Isn't there any way?!

154
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,850
We're short of tranquilizer bullets
as well as soldiers.

155
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,230
What should we do?

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
If nothing is done...

157
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,780
Vice Admiral Maynard!

158
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,860
What's wrong?!

159
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,640
The fight between Sabo of the Revolutionary Army and Issho-san in Acacia,

160
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,660
winded up in a draw due to injury!

161
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,460
What?! Don't be silly!

162
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,540
The admirals from HQ are
the Navy's greatest military powers!

163
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,200
Why, Issho-san?!

164
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,050
Doflamingo can't keep his position as a Warlord after this!

165
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,390
We have to capture him now!

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,690
The Navy has been doing the same thing over and over again just like that!

167
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,030
You have been in the Navy for a long time
haven't you, Vice Admiral-san?

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,620
Weren't you even listening all this time?

169
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,260
To these screams filled with anger?

170
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,130
They are not crying! They are angry!

171
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,460
Does the World Government...

172
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,140
...pretend to be God or something?!

173
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,780
Those words... hang over my head...

174
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,090
What should we do?!

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,850
But now isn't the time to think about it!

176
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,710
We'll deal with the pirates that
headed for Doflamingo later!

177
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,490
In any event, we'll keep trying to bring
the nationwide confusion under control!

178
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,070
Do your best not to harm
any citizens or animals!

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,320
Sedate those who are out of control
with tranquilizer bullets!

180
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,330
That's all we can do now...

181
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,090
I see no end! Can we bring them under control?!

182
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Dad!

183
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,430
Mom!

184
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,970
Are you okay?

185
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,260
Damn! So annoying! Can't take it off!

186
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,470
It's no use!

187
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,110
Dodge, Straw Hat!

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

189
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,660
Gum-Gum...

190
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,100
...Octopus Stamp!

191
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,090
That was close!

192
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,970
Behind you!

193
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,010
You guys have no idea...

194
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,650
Can you imagine what people would do
to a fallen Celestial Dragon?

195
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
People are all...

196
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,080
...cruel.

197
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,340
What are you talking about,
Fake-mingo?!

198
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,110
All right then,
let's begin with the executions.

199
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,320
You're the first, Law...

200
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,350
Hey!

201
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,680
Chop him up into bits and pieces,
like he did to me!

202
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm really... disappointed by you...

203
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,370
There's something not quite clear to me.

204
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,900
You're a former Celestial Dragon, expelled from Mariejois.

205
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,010
Why do you still have power?!

206
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,810
CP-0 works directly under the command of the World Gov't

207
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,060
but you brought them into action this morning!

208
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,150
Do you still wish to know that
even though you're going to die soon?

209
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,190
It's because I know about
the important national treasure...

210
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,770
...that they have inside
The Holyland of Mariejois!

211
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,440
The national treasure in Mariejois?

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,670
Yes. It's something that could shake the world
by its very existence.

213
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,510
Kill Doflamingo-eh!

214
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,760
We can't keep that kid alive-eh!

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,170
To them, I'm an escapee who has the most dangerous card to play.

216
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,770
They tried to kill me but I didn't die

217
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,520
so the Celestial Dragons became very cooperative.

218
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,770
Plus, if I could have had your Op-Op Fruit power
in my hands that day,

219
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,750
I would have taken the helm of the world
utilizing the national treasure in Mariejois!

220
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,470
Your power has such value.

221
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,330
As well as the "Personality Transplant Surgery,"
there's another usage!

222
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,640
Do you know about it?

223
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,930
If a wise man utilizes the Op-Op Fruit, even the dream

224
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,460
people have had since ancient times could come true.

225
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,120
That's why quite a lot of people call it
the ultimate Devil Fruit.

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,650
Yeah, I know...
Even though I have no interest in it.

227
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,210
The greatest power of this fruit is
to grant another person eternal life...

228
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,340
...via the "Perpetual Youth Surgery"!

229
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,530
The greatest power of this fruit is
to grant another person eternal life...

230
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,600
...via the "Perpetual Youth Surgery"!

231
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,120
But once it's performed,
the surgeon himself will die.

232
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,540
Indeed!

233
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,620
That's why I wasn't gonna let you eat it!

234
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,790
How dare you repay kindness with ingratitude!

235
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,250
Oh, I'm sorry!

236
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Diamante's swordplay!

237
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,840
Bullet String!

238
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
Lao G's martial art!

239
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,020
Room! Injection Shot!

240
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,650
Gladius's gunnery!

241
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,760
You got all your fighting skills from us!

242
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,370
Yeah!

243
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,330
And I'm still here thanks to Cora-san!

244
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,050
I'm grateful!

245
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,800
Because I can take you all down with this power!

246
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,710
TRAFALGAR LAW (10 YEARS OLD)
A BOY FROM THE WHITE TOWN

247
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,880
Damn!

248
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:40,720
SPIDER MILES - A PORT TOWN IN THE NORTH BLUE
16 YEARS AGO

249
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,820
Don't kill him, Diamante.

250
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,220
This is just a try-out before we take him into our Family as an apprentice.

251
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,530
--You jerk!
--I know, Doffy.

252
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,390
If I beat him,
will you make me an Executive?

253
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,880
DIAMANTE AND TREBOL
♦ ♣ EXECUTIVES OF THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

254
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,500
Can't help my nose from running!

255
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,140
Damn!

256
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,730
Are you serious?

257
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,900
Stop laughing! I'm serious!

258
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,170
You can't kill a person
just with your spirit!

259
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,210
I told you! I have explosives!

260
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,090
I'm gonna die soon anyway
so I'm not afraid of anything!

261
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,970
Don't mess with pirates!

262
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,860
He was just a big talker-dasuyan.

263
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,660
It's over! It's over! Let's play tag!

264
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,120
Okay-dasuyan!

265
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,780
Dammit...

266
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,070
Wait! Wait, wait!

267
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,530
THE WASTE PROCESSING PLANT

268
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,860
No-dasuyan!

269
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,580
Where's the captain?

270
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,970
Our captain Doffy doesn't have time
for a kid like you.

271
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,840
Uh-huh, uh-huh! We understand
you can't live long and you'll die soon.

272
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,510
When? Hey, hey!
When are you gonna die?

273
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,590
Three years and two months from now.

274
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,440
A doctor said so?

275
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,970
My dead father was a doctor.
I found out by seeing my medical data.

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,620
What a smart brat.

277
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,060
I wanna kill as many as I can
in these three years

278
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,910
and destroy everything!

279
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,420
He must have a screw loose!

280
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,070
Can't help my nose running!

281
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,920
Well, we accept kids, too.

282
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,490
We had about hundred kids come until now

283
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,810
but most of them escaped crying within two days.

284
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,060
Are you gonna be okay?

285
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,080
Nin! Trebol-sama!

286
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,780
Diamante-sama!

287
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,320
They're the only kids remaining.

288
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,850
What is it? Buffalo? Baby 5?

289
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,660
Cora-san came back!

290
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,930
--He tripped!
--We knew he was gonna trip-dasuyan!

291
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,020
--You tripped! You tripped! You tripped!
--Dasuyan! Dasuyan! Dasuyan!

292
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,650
--You tripped! You tripped!
--Dasuyan! Dasuyan!

293
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,940
Dasuyan....

294
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,980
Doffy won't care if you're a kid or not.

295
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,740
If you do it right, you can get promoted quickly
but if you're useless, that's it.

296
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Well, good luck.

297
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,310
Cora-san, I brought you a cup of tea.

298
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,020
It's hot.

299
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,200
Corazon, did you finish your work
without any trouble?

300
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,090
Then, give me the earnings.
We have to be faithful when it comes to money.

301
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:58,420
Your name is Law, isn't it?
This guy who just returned is an Executive like us.

302
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,020
His name is Corazon.

303
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:06,360
CORAZON - A ♥ EXECUTIVE OF THE DON QUIXOTE FAMILY

304
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,770
He's an absent-minded idiot but...

305
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,360
...he's strong, maybe because of his blood.

306
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,620
Captain Doffy's brother by blood.

307
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,660
He can't speak because of a traumatic event
in his past, I heard.

308
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,980
In addition...

309
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,060
He doesn't like kids. Be careful.

310
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,690
What the...?!

311
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,110
Oh, he's dead!

312
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,520
He crashed into the mountain of scrap metal-dasuyan!

313
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,010
What's wrong with him?! He must be nuts!

314
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,320
Damn! Damn!

315
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,480
Damn! Damn! Damn!!

316
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,170
I'm gonna kill him!!

317
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,650
Cora-san caught fire!
