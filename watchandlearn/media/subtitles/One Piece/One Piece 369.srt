2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,930
This is...

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,810
...one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,440
He's the "Tyrant" Bartholomew Kuma!

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,190
If you were to go on a trip,
where would you like to go?

51
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,430
Of all the stupid...! I nearly let
the weight of your title crush me.

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,870
What a dreadful man!

53
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,830
Negative Ghost!

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,290
And Special Hollow!

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,540
I can't ask Moria's whereabouts
when you're being belligerent.

56
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,640
Where'd she go?

57
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,750
Aren't you the Cat Burglar?

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,810
You're part of the Straw Hat Crew!

59
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,150
What gives?! He got up there
in the blink of an eye!

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,020
Did he warp...?

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,870
Is he after Luffy? I've got to let him know!

62
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,160
I've got ya, Moria!

63
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,090
The shadow? I've been chasing after the...

64
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,840
Sh-Shoot! He pulled a fast one on me!

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,270
"Oars + Moria! The Most Heinous
Combination of Brains and Brawn!"

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,780
Darn it! When did he swap out with his shadow?

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Why, you--!

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,750
Hey! Wait, Moria's Shadow!

69
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,130
Don't leave me here!

70
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,550
Where am I?!

71
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,050
Hey!

72
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,510
Shoot! This bites.

73
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,100
I said that I would recover everyone's shadows.

74
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,690
It'll be bad if I don't get our shadows back.

75
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,860
Uh... What happens if we don't have shadows?

76
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,230
Now I remember! As we are now,

77
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm pretty sure the guys and I will melt in the sunlight.

78
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,370
We'll be in a jam when the sun rises, huh?

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,050
Shoot! I have to finish this up before dawn!

80
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,760
I never dreamed this would happen!

81
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,100
For now, all I can do is follow Moria's shadow!

82
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,910
Zoro, I really think we should
buy time until Luffy defeats Moria!

83
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,580
I just obtained the black blade, Shusui.

84
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,750
Can you blame me for wanting to test it out
on the monster standing before me?

85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,550
Come on, man!

86
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,020
Oars!

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,930
Huh?

88
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,970
Have at me! I will be your opponent!

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,140
All right.

90
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,600
You're going to fight him alone?!

91
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,650
Whoa, Zoro! There is no way
you can fight him by yourself!

92
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,450
Come back here so we can regroup!

93
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,620
Comparing the two swords,

94
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,910
the black blade, Shusui, is considerably
heavier than my old Yubashiri.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,580
Hey, Zoro! Dodge!

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,130
Going by its weight...!

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,760
Amazing! He used brute strength
alone to divert that punch!

98
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,180
Three-Sword Style...

99
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,810
...108-Pound Phoenix!

100
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,800
It's huge!

101
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,650
Drat! It didn't hit him!

102
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,360
I can't believe he dodged that!

103
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,150
Shusui's slash absorbed the ones
from the other two swords

104
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,370
and became one big slash!

105
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,720
But there is excess damage
around where it cut the stone.

106
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,000
It's proof that I haven't
mastered this sword yet.

107
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,040
It is several levels more
powerful than my old one,

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,170
but it doesn't seem like
the most compliant of swords.

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,760
You gave me a great blade, swordsman Ryuma!

110
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,730
You're good! I bet that
woulda hurt bad if it hit,

111
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,150
you bastard!

112
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm gonna trample you!

113
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,660
Lemme step on you!

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,700
--Zoro!
--Will he be okay?

115
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,230
Jerk!

116
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,050
Unless I make a bigger opening,
all I can do is dodge!

117
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,560
Now!

118
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,100
Three-Sword Style! 108--

119
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,820
Now I'm going to crush you!

120
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,700
Zoro!

121
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,770
Tsk!

122
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,480
I bet he's as flat as a pancake.

123
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,460
Huh?

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,180
He isn't there!

125
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,960
Where did he go?

126
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,920
Darn! I can't see him through the dust.

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,470
Three-Sword Style...

128
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,390
...108-Pound Phoenix!

129
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,390
Yikes! That was close.

130
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,690
Damn! That stupid monster dodged again!

131
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,110
Shrimp, quit sneaking around!

132
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,990
Zoro! S-Seriously, don't do anything crazy!

133
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,330
Even if by some miracle
you managed to defeat him,

134
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,330
all you'd get out of it is Luffy's shadow!

135
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,620
We don't even know where
your and Sanji's shadows are.

136
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,340
But if Luffy defeats Moria, everyone will
instantly get their shadows back!

137
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,340
You don't need to get hurt
fighting an immortal giant zombie!

138
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,890
Let's believe in Luffy and work on
keeping this behemoth busy!

139
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,300
I fully believe in him...

140
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,270
...but even Luffy has a weakness.

141
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,980
Huh?

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,580
Trickery!

143
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,550
The invisible man, the ghost girl,
and the master of shadows...

144
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,740
This island is a nesting grounds for
deceptive Devil Fruit power holders.

145
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,120
I doubt the enemy will
fight Luffy fair and square.

146
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,120
That's a good point.

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,080
Yeah.

148
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,540
If he gives Luffy the slip and morning comes...

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Luffy, the cook, and I won't be able
to put up a decent fight anymore!

150
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,930
So at the very least, if we can get
Luffy back to normal before dawn,

151
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,720
he'll take over from there.

152
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,470
I'd say we have less than
thirty minutes until sunrise.

153
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,640
But these are foggy waters.
The morning sun won't hit everywhere.

154
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,440
So morning is on the horizon...
This fog is the only thing in our favor.

155
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,410
Honestly, the fear of annihilation is
just now setting in with sunrise so close.

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,340
Ah, I found the runts!

157
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,600
Wh-What's that?!

158
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,890
Why is the ship shaking?!

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,470
What's going on?!

160
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,600
The ship must have gotten caught
in another weird current like earlier!

161
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,020
Huh?! Hey, look!

162
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,810
It's the sky!

163
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,780
It's the pre-dawn sky!

164
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,610
The fog is dissipating before our very eyes!

165
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,070
What's going on?!

166
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,580
Does this mean we've left the Florian Triangle?!

167
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,460
It's because Oars was fooling
around with the rudder earlier!

168
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,040
That bastard! Look at what he's done!

169
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,300
This is stinkin' bad!

170
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,840
Thriller Bark has pulled out of the fog!

171
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,890
We're doomed!

172
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,100
Sunrise is just around the corner!
Is this the end of the line?

173
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,640
It's too soon to give up!

174
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,270
The Star of Hope's crew is
fighting even as we speak.

175
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,230
H-Hey, check that out!

176
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,320
It's Moria's shadow!

177
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,030
It's flying back to the mansion.

178
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,740
So what?

179
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,070
Stupid! Don't you see?

180
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,280
Straw Hat has been chasing it.

181
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,990
It should lead him right to us.

182
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,540
In other words, if we set up an ambush...

183
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,420
Oh, I get it!

184
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,000
Great! Let's inform the captain and the others.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,670
We have to stop Straw Hat!

186
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,050
Yeah, got it!

187
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,470
Moria-sama, something horrible has happened!

188
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,220
After all this time, Thriller Bark
has left the foggy waters!

189
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,560
All because of Oars!

190
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,530
Moria-sama!

191
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,280
Don't make a scene. So what if we left the fog?

192
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,700
We're pirates! I don't care where
we are as long as we're on the ocean!

193
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,080
Uh, but...

194
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,740
More importantly, zip your lips, because I

195
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,170
am entertaining the most unusual of guests!

196
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,770
Isn't that right, Tyrant Kuma,

197
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:50,010
the only Warlord who does the Government's bidding?

198
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,960
Isn't that right, Tyrant Kuma,

199
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,580
the only Warlord who does the Government's bidding?

200
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,580
I'm sure the Government finds you useful,
but what are you plotting?

201
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,630
People like you are the most unsettling!

202
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,590
If you were to go on a trip,
where would you like to go?

203
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,130
Whoa, whoa! Don't go there!

204
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,180
I know what your powers are.

205
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,550
Did you come to fight me?

206
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,520
State your business! What brought you here?

207
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,980
I came to make a report.

208
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,230
A report...?

209
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,150
It has been decided who will
fill the empty Warlord seat

210
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,000
created by Crocodile's dismissal.

211
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,240
You should have said so sooner!

212
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,240
Who was it and what ocean was he from?

213
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
There are a bazillion pirates out there!

214
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,620
The name of his successor is Marshall D. Teach.

215
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,170
The man also goes by Blackbeard.

216
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,460
Blackbeard? I've never heard of him.

217
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,990
He ran away from Whitebeard's crew.

218
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,470
People are already starting to talk about him.

219
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,510
Vortex!

220
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,980
St. Elmo's Fire!

221
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,400
Damn it!

222
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,360
Die in darkness!

223
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,780
Flame Commandment...

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,790
Flame Emperor!

225
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,020
News hasn't reached your foggy waters,

226
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,400
but he joined after proving his strength.

227
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,520
And what was his original bounty?

228
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,070
Zero.

229
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,120
I see. So his capability is still unknown.

230
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,370
I'm amazed the Government approved.

231
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,210
But at least that seat has been filled!

232
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,170
Won't this help stabilize
the world's power balance?

233
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,390
No, I imagine this will do the exact opposite,

234
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,510
but that is irrelevant.

235
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,600
To cut to the chase, the Government
is rather concerned about something.

236
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,810
Since the incident at Enies Lobby,

237
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,360
they are constantly keeping
tabs on the Straw Hat Crew.

238
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,330
They knew if the Straw Hats followed a

239
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,130
Log from Water Seven to Fishman Island,

240
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,740
the chances of you stopping
them here would be high.

241
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,410
Do you see what the Government fears?

242
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,190
The Government

243
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,840
is afraid that Straw Hat
will defeat yet another of the Seven Warlords.

244
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,220
Don't give me that! You're worried about me?!

245
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,270
Me, the person who took this seat
to suppress the weak pirates?!

246
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,230
If necessary, I would be willing
to offer you my assistance.

247
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,780
Who do you think you're talking to, bastard?!

248
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,540
Are you saying I might lose to a
small band of inexperienced pirates?!

249
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,790
You cannot 100% guarantee victory in battle.

250
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,050
Who would have predicted
the defeat of Rob Lucci

251
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,050
during the incident at Enies Lobby?

252
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,090
Jet...

253
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,800
...Gatling!

254
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,630
Even so, are you telling me
that the Government is so scared

255
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,080
that they want to throw
two Warlords at them?! Well?!

256
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,460
I thought I'd help after delivering the report.

257
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,840
It is not as though I was ordered to assist you.

258
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Then feast your eyes on what I do
to those pirates while you're here!

259
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,220
And then tell those pampered
idiots what you witnessed!

260
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,900
Tell them about how Gecko Moria effortlessly turned the

261
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,740
Straw Hat Crew that outwitted them into zombie soldiers!

262
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,670
The fog...!

263
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,490
This sucks!

264
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,700
That thick fog... was our one ray of hope!

265
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,540
Who planned for the fog to
clear up now of all times?!

266
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,330
The morning sun is going
to shine straight onto us!

267
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,530
Damn it! We've got enough problems on

268
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,380
our hands without having to deal with Oars!

269
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,680
The sky is unexpectedly clear tonight.

270
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,960
M-Moria! It's Moria!

271
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,020
Where?! Where is he?!

272
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,890
Hey, don't mess with us!

273
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,730
The sun will be rising soon.

274
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,690
Should you really be farting around?

275
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,900
Why is he here? What happened to Luffy?

276
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,200
Huh? I can hear Master's voice!

277
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,700
Hey! Hold up, Usopp!
Where the heck is Moria?

278
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,750
Can't you see him? Look up there!

279
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,910
In the gut! He's in the middle of Oars' gut!

280
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,120
Inside his stomach?

281
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,830
I see him!

282
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,300
Hogback! This was his doing!

283
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,430
What is Moria doing there?

284
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,770
So where's Luffy? Did Moria
seriously give him the slip?

285
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,310
Or did he...?

286
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,240
No one can take Luffy down!

287
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah!

288
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,980
That's strange. I could have
sworn I heard Master's voice.

289
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,360
There he is! Is that a cockpit?

290
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,450
I'll be! Is my tummy a cockpit?

291
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,910
Hey!

292
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,460
This is pretty well made!

293
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,290
I wanna ride in the cockpit!

294
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,300
Hey, stupid! Don't stick
your fingers in the cockpit!

295
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Okay, Master!

296
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,550
This is so cool! I'm like a robot.

297
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,470
Roar! I'm a giant robot!

298
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,520
Creak, creak, creak, creak!

299
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,240
Screech! Screech!

300
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,520
Whoa, that was close!

301
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,270
I'm the giant robot, uh, Oarsbomber!
Nice to meet you!

302
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,860
Why Oarsbomber?

303
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,990
Oarsbomber?

304
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,450
How could you be a robot
when you're a zombie?!

305
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,530
Robots are like, "Ka-ching!" and "Ka-ling!"

306
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,370
I'm psyched that I get to be a giant robot!

307
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,330
Oars, give it a rest! Don't get so hyped up.

308
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,710
Okay, Master.

309
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,130
Okay, punks! I am going to
offer you the chance to fight me.

310
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,050
If you are victorious, you can
set all of the shadows free.

311
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,220
All of you can attack at once!

312
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,540
But if you don't defeat Oars,
you'll never pull me out of him.

313
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,860
That creep...

314
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,070
That's low!

315
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,150
We can't purify Oars if we don't defeat Moria,

316
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,490
but Moria went inside of Oars!

317
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,490
But doesn't that simplify things?
Our target is right there.

318
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,450
We have to take them down!

319
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,660
Usopp! If a little wouldn't cut it,
go find a boatload of salt!

320
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,960
That is the only way to purify Oars.

321
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,550
We'll weaken him as much
as possible in the meantime.

322
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,260
Yep! Leave that to us!

323
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,140
--Let's do this.
--Okay! You got it! I'll go get some!

324
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm pretty sure there was a kitchen
in the first mansion we went to!

325
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,400
There should be a bunch of salt there!

326
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,610
I thought they looked pumped,
but they're after salt.

327
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,820
Hey, Oars! Crush the path to the mansion,
along with that long-nosed guy!

328
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,160
Make it impossible for them
to reach the kitchen!

329
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,620
Okay, Master.

330
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,950
Usopp!

331
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,360
Huh? What?!

332
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,400
Crap!

333
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,420
Usopp!

334
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
Usopp!

335
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,270
Shit! Oars is acting intelligently
now that Moria is with him!

336
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,770
Usopp!

337
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,110
Where are you?! Answer me!

338
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,440
He's okay!

339
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,660
I thought that you might need salt,
so I gathered it in bulk!

340
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,780
Brook!

341
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,950
You're a lifesaver!

342
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,000
I am your Brook!

343
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Who are you guys?

344
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,340
We're the Risky Brothers!

345
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,680
We'll give you incredible powers!

346
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,390
Say what?

347
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,350
S-Stop it!

348
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,450
What do you think?

349
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm bursting with power! Nothing can stop me!

350
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,690
On the next episode of One Piece!

351
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,940
"The Secret Plan to Turn the Tables!
Nightmare Luffy Makes His Appearance!"

352
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
