00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,860

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,280
2 years have passed since the
War of the Best in Marineford.

69
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,400
Luffy and his crew each
completed individual training

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:03,840
and returned to Sabaody Archipelago to
go on to the next stage - the New World.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,260
Oh, what is this?

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,170
It got tense all of the sudden.

73
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,110
But, Rayleigh, Luffy is not here!

74
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,090
Don't worry!

75
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,010
Captain!

76
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,680
Huh?

77
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,220
Isn't he the guy you're looking for?

78
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,290
Oh!

79
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,770
Luffy is here already!

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,610
I gave Sanji a Baby Transponder
Snail when he came here.

81
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,860
He's with Zoro.

82
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,820
Alright, I'll fight you!

83
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,530
I trained my legs in hell for 2 years!

84
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,910
Bring it on! I'll cut you in half!

85
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,670
Oh, that's good because
you guys have to hurry

86
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,290
- the Navy will be here soon.

87
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,530
So it's only Monkey-chan that we can't reach.

88
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,810
But take this Vivre Card.

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,130
It will lead him to you.

90
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,790
Grove #42 will be perfect - it's on the sea.

91
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,770
Take the ship there and rendezvous!

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,770
It's a little busy but you
all got through these 2 years

93
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,650
and it's time for the new journey!

94
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,970
"The Battle is on! Show Them
What You Got From Training!"

95
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,090
As for the rest, read
this before you set out.

96
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,390
You can learn how to operate
a coated ship in detail.

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,380
Okay, thank you!

98
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,200
I wonder how Luffy has
changed in these 2 years.

99
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
I can't wait to see him!

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,020
Me too!

101
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,300
Okay, let's go to Grove #42!

102
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,470
Oops, I have to call Zoro and Sanji.

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,600
But Luffy...

104
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,190
I hope he doesn't get
caught up in some trouble.

105
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,830
Oh, that's right, it's Luffy.

106
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,100
We never set out peacefully because of him.

107
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,450
Leave it to me!

108
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,030
I'm gonna go pick him up! I have an idea.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,640
Hey, you fools! We're gonna
arrest all of you in our way!

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,150
What are you doing, Navy?!
Don't bother Soul King!

111
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,220
Hey, what's going on there?

112
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,890
It's out of control!

113
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,390
The Navy who came here to
arrest Soul King has been

114
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,360
blocked by his fans

115
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,520
and he got away somehow!

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,920
Damn! That traitor!

117
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,520
Yes, I have some big news!

118
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,670
The musician, Brook, is a
friend of Straw Hat Luffy

119
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,860
and he is a pirate himself!

120
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,830
Thank you! The timing was perfect!

121
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,900
Sister Shakky asked me to do this!

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,690
Your friends will be waiting at Grove #42!

123
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,110
It's been a while! My heart
is filled with anticipation!

124
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,340
Oh, I don't have a heart to be filled.

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
What's wrong with them?!

126
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,860
They're both extremely strong!

127
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,030
You've improved a bit, you
third-class swordsman.

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,190
You've learned some idiotic
kicking skills, yourself!

129
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,910
I hope your cooking skills have
worsened, you shitty cook!

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
--what did you say?!
--what did you say?!

131
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
--Ring, ring, ring...
--Huh?

132
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Ow! That's right!

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,050
The Navy has set out and Luffy
should be here somewhere!

134
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,560
We're gonna take Sunny to Grove
#42 so come meet us there!

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,580
Roger.

136
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,440
Clank.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,890
--What did he want?
--Weren't you listening?

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,510
Well...

139
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,960
Navy. Come. We. Ship. Run.

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,560
Get that?

141
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
No, I don't! Why are you talking like that?!

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,170
Say it in a proper sentence!

143
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,000
I thought a musclehead like you
couldn't understand sentences.

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,370
Okay. You. Later. Slashed.

145
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,980
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,460
By the way, do you hear that uproar?

147
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,250
You're right. There. Noisy.

148
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,980
Huh? What's going on here?

149
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,610
Shut up, you guys!

150
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,450
We already found one of the
perpetrators who have insulted me!

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,020
It's this guy!

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,540
I'll teach him a lesson first!

153
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,880
About how formidable I am!

154
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,050
And what I'm about to do to him

155
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,470
is a warning to you all, my men!

156
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,680
If you mess with me, this
is how you're gonna end up!

157
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,440
Do you understand?!

158
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,600
A guy with a 400 million
berry bounty sure is scary!

159
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,470
What's the matter with this guy?

160
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,200
Zoro, Sanji, do you know him?

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,880
Huh?

162
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,990
Well you see, a little while ago...

163
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,030
That's it, you pirates!

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,290
Straw Hat Luffy and his
following! Just surrender!

165
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,540
The Navy...?

166
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,710
We're blocking off every exit of Grove #46!

167
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,630
You can't get away now!

168
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,050
Huh? How did the Navy find out about me?

169
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,590
What are you talking about?

170
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,350
Captain! We're under siege!

171
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,370
You fool! Don't panic!

172
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,620
This is why we recruited the new members!

173
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,820
We have guys with bounties over 100 million!

174
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,150
But there are a lot of them...

175
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,350
Stupid! Watch this!

176
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,700
Hey, Caribou!

177
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,530
Use the Navy soldier as a
shield and make a way out!

178
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,270
Navy soldier?

179
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,610
They caught our scout!

180
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,070
Damn, that's not good!

181
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,530
Huh?

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,290
What did you say, Big Boss?!

183
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,160
I said "use the Navy soldier
as a shield," you fool!

184
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,370
I see. Use this Navy soldier as a shield...

185
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,220
What are you doing, Caribou?!

186
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,030
We got to use him to get away from here!

187
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,260
I can't do that, Big Boss!

188
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,200
What?

189
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,890
Because this soldier lied to me saying
he hadn't called the Navy yet!

190
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,250
No, stupid!

191
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,260
That crazy ass! He ignored my order!

192
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,180
Uh-oh, he did it...

193
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,450
There is an unspoken rule that you
can just tell a lie to bad guys

194
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,510
but we should put a stop to that!

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,200
Looks like you guys have
no intention to surrender!

196
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Let's get the pirates!

197
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,350
Fools! Our boss is a man with a 400
million bounty - Straw Hat Luffy!

198
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's fight!

199
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,500
This is no good, Captain, let's run!

200
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,840
You fools! You have to listen to me!

201
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,670
Huh? What are they calling me "boss"?

202
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,430
Again, what are you talking about?

203
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,360
Don't be scared! Go!

204
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,820
You're...

205
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,660
The 88 million berry bounty
- Lip "Service" Doughty!

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,540
I liked the way you fight.

207
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,750
Don't be scared! Get ready to shoot!

208
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,170
He's got a 92 million berry bounty...

209
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,510
"Gashed" Albion!

210
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,140
Don't back down! Fight for justice!

211
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,260
Yeah!

212
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,810
It stinks! Hypocrites' blood!

213
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,840
A 210 million bounty - "Wet-Haired" Caribou!

214
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,150
Just surrender!

215
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,200
What?! You're a Devil Fruit eater?!

216
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,630
You should not do that!

217
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,990
It's not healthy to push yourself too hard!

218
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,080
My sword...!

219
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,290
We can beat them, Captain!
Those pirates are strong!

220
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah, you're right.

221
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,170
Hey, guys!

222
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:29,430
The one who kills the most Navy Soldiers
will become my right-hand man!

223
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,560
So go for it!

224
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah!

225
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,340
Your right-hand man?

226
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,440
What about us?

227
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,320
You guys better do something too
because, with this much power,

228
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,860
I'm gonna launch out into the world!

229
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,950
Whoa! What is it now?!

230
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,580
Pacifistas!

231
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,620
What?!

232
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,890
Why are the Navy's human weapons here?!

233
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,940
They're the bear-like men!

234
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,640
But Hancock told me not to cause trouble...

235
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,770
Again, what the hell are you talking about?!

236
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,530
A pirate--Straw Hat Luffy. Verified.

237
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,570
Are those real Pacifistas?
They're aiming at me?!

238
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,670
Pacifistas, huh? It's exciting!

239
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,970
88 million berry bounty. Lip
"Service" Doughty. Subdued.

240
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,050
Captain Doughty!

241
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,050
Follow the Pacifistas! Catch the pirates!

242
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,890
Yeah!

243
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,440
A single blow?!

244
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,390
He had an 88 million bounty
and he was no match...

245
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,510
This is bad news... Oh,
Captain, where are you going?

246
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,270
--Wait for me!
--Hey, hey!

247
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,570
Fools! I don't wanna fight
him - he beat Doughty!

248
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,320
We better run!

249
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,910
Straw Hat Boss, do something!

250
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,260
If nothing is done, those human
weapons will kill us all!

251
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,100
Big Boss!

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,210
Huh?

253
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
Big Boss is gone!

254
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,950
Big Boss?

255
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,590
That's how they call Straw Hat?

256
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,550
Wait! My side hurts!

257
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,140
Fool! Run! They're gonna kill you!

258
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,790
Stupid! You're in my way!

259
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,980
Huh? Who are you?

260
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
That's...

261
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,390
Big Boss!

262
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,070
That's interesting!

263
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,510
--Look at that, Coribou!
--Yes, brother!

264
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,580
--Not that way, fool!
--I'm sorry!

265
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,080
Big Boss Luffy, beat them up!

266
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,750
Show them Straw Hats' power!

267
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,220
Why are they calling you Straw Hat?

268
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,600
Hey, you! Don't you know who I am?

269
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Get out of my way or I'll kill
you and pull out your bowels!

270
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,650
This may surprise you! I'm the
Revolutionary Dragon's son!

271
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,400
And the grandson of the hero--Garp!

272
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,090
I wreaked havoc during the War of the Best!

273
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm a big-time pirate with a
400 million bounty--Straw...

274
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,170
Straw Hat is not scum like you!

275
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,230
Why are they calling you Straw Hat?

276
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,570
Hey, you! Don't you know who I am?

277
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,400
Get out of my way or I'll kill
you and pull out your bowels!

278
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,550
This may surprise you!

279
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,660
I'm the Revolutionary Dragon's son!

280
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,410
And the grandson of the hero--Garp!

281
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,040
I wreaked havoc during the War of the Best!

282
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,670
I'm a big-time pirate with a
400 million bounty--Straw...

283
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,120
Straw Hat is not scum like you!

284
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,760
Huh?

285
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,890
What?!

286
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,100
Straw Hat Boss!

287
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,620
I see.

288
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,480
They all got fooled and became his crew.

289
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,320
PX-5, who is he for real?

290
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,740
"Triple-Tongued" Demalo Black.

291
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,210
A 26 million berry bounty.

292
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,500
--What?!
--26 million? That means he is...

293
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,710
...An imposter?!

294
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,380
They found out! Let's run!

295
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,530
What's up with that shit?!

296
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,510
So he posed as Straw Hat
Luffy and tricked us!

297
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,680
Because the real one is dead!

298
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,470
Damn! I almost got ripped
off by a jerk with a

299
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,440
measly 26 million berry bounty!

300
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,160
What?

301
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,850
So He was posing as me?

302
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,640
That Sanji and Zoro, too?

303
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,230
They looked just like the real ones!

304
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,450
I better leave here before it's too late.

305
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,120
The one who fooled you is an idiot
but you guys are just unlucky.

306
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,630
You all have to come with us.

307
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,590
And I don't know why but the
real Straw Hat is here too.

308
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,650
What?

309
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,010
When we entered this area, PX-5 detected him.

310
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,430
Shoot at him, PX-5!

311
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
That was close!

312
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,480
What are you doing?!

313
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,410
This bag is holding all my precious lunches!

314
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,120
H-Here's his poster...

315
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,520
Looks exactly the same!

316
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,350
So that guy is the real Straw Hat!

317
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,700
Brace up!

318
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,620
We came here to catch the real one anyway!

319
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,560
Straw Hat!

320
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,030
Oh, it's you! Are you gonna
get in my way again?!

321
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,070
I've been told not to cause
trouble in order to set sail!

322
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,280
Don't worry! You don't need to set sail!

323
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,740
Unlike 2 years ago, I'm officially
a member of the Navy now!

324
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,420
So I'm gonna catch you here!

325
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,130
PX-5!

326
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,940
That's slow...

327
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,270
What?!

328
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,170
Second Gear!

329
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,780
Gum-Gum...

330
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,750
...Jet Pistol!

331
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,220
Straw Hat...

332
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,680
He is using Haki!

333
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,770
He beat the Pacifista with a single blow!

334
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,190
See ya!

335
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,070
I think I'll see you somewhere again!

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,450
Wait, Straw Hat!

337
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,620
Don't let Straw Hat get away!

338
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,870
Yeah!

339
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,130
Hey, Luffy!

340
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,960
Oh?

341
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,420
Luffy! I knew it was you!

342
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,380
Why are you always in trouble?!

343
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh!

344
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,590
It's no mistake this time!
It's been a while, guys!

345
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,100
Roronoa! "Black Foot"!
I knew they were alive!

346
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,140
PX-7!

347
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,110
Outta my way!

348
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,990
I cut him!

349
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,370
No, I broke his neck!

350
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,630
The Straw Hats! The real ones!

351
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,750
They're nothing like the imposters!

352
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,060
Hey, Luffy, you're the 9th.

353
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,230
Shut up! Cut it out!

354
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,660
Luffy, hurry up!  Everybody's
waiting at the ship!

355
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,600
Okay!

356
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,100
Don't let them get away!
Catch them at any cost!

357
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,530
It's really been a long time!
I wonder how everybody is!

358
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,560
I'm so happy!

359
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,200
Hey, what's wrong?

360
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh!

361
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,340
Rayleigh!

362
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,300
What?!

363
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,310
No way!

364
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,380
D-Dark King Rayleigh?!

365
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,060
I came here to check but you seem alright.

366
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,220
Your power sure has improved.

367
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,690
Uh-huh!

368
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,570
Now go to your friends!

369
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:29,240
Uh-huh! Rayleigh, thank you for
everything these past 2 years!

370
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,670
You're out of character. Just go!

371
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,840
Rayleigh!

372
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,010
I'll do it!

373
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,220
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

374
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,050
After two long years

375
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,270
the Straw Hats finally assemble on the Sunny.

376
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,190
But there is no time to rejoice.

377
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,440
As they are about to depart for

378
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,850
the sea floor paradise, Fish-Man Island,

379
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,400
the pursuing Marines arrive on the scene.

380
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,790
On the next episode of One Piece!

381
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,070
"Everyone Together! Luffy,
Setting Out for the New World!"

382
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
