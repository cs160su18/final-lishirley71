2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,890
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,870
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,820
Come on, guys!

48
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,360
What is going on?!

49
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,490
Didn't we take down Moria?!

50
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,990
Luffy!

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,610
"Not Out of Danger Yet!
Orders to Annihilate the Straw Hat Crew!"

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,610
Hey, Zoro!

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,030
Robin!

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,820
Sanji!

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,320
Their bodies are vanishing!

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,470
Why?! Didn't we win?

57
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,220
Dang it! Were we too late?

58
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,530
They're vanishing!

59
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,990
Captain Lola!

60
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,680
Guys!

61
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,440
I thought we won, darn it!

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,830
"A Pirate Ship on the Grand Line"

63
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,120
I don't believe it!

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,510
Captain!

65
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,220
Please come to the deck, Captain!

66
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,590
Quit being stupid and hit the hay!

67
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,550
The morning light will fry you!

68
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,780
It's been two years since Moria
stole our shadows. We'll never...

69
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,440
But Captain, please take a look at my feet!

70
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,960
Huh?

71
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,420
You have... a shadow!

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,700
I bet your shadow has also returned, Captain!

73
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,380
O-O-Our...

74
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,530
Our shadows are back!

75
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,550
It's everyone, Captain!
All of our shadows have come back!

76
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,310
Captain, do you think someone defeated Moria?

77
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,510
No way! That's impossible.

78
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,480
He's so powerful that he went up
against Kaido of the Four Emperors.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,510
Who could possibly take out Moria?

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,860
"Somewhere in the West Blue
on the Grand Line"

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,660
It's back! I have a shadow again!

82
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,240
How many years has it been
since I've seen the light of day?

83
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,430
Our zombies in Thriller Bark
finally kicked the bucket!

84
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,580
Yay! It's great!

85
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,390
Hurray!

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,040
We're free from Moria's curse!

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Boss!

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
I can watch the sunrise!

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,860
Look! I have a shadow! It's following me!

90
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,620
I have a reflection!
I can see myself in the mirror.

91
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,870
Hey! What was all that
commotion about, Margarita?

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,500
My shadow! My shadow has come back.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,700
What?! Your shadow has returned?

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,970
As in the shadow that was stolen
by pirates ten years ago?

95
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,230
It's true...

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,960
Sir, I'm terribly sorry!

97
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,030
I was so surprised that I accidentally
dropped your prized dishes!

98
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,140
It's true I had hard feelings
towards plates, but I've reformed!

99
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,740
I didn't mean any harm.

100
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,310
I am really sorry. I will leave
the manor immediately.

101
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,440
How could you say that?

102
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,690
I don't care about those plates!

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,410
Did you get hurt?

104
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,010
Really, this calls for a celebration!

105
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,650
This is truly wonderful, Margarita.

106
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,970
You must be so happy.

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,860
I am!

108
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,750
Isn't it great, Margarita?

109
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,210
Phew!

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,530
I'm very much alive.

111
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,840
For a second, I thought I
was about to go to Heaven.

112
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,220
Sounds good to me! If we can go together,
I'd love to go to Heaven!

113
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,750
This isn't funny, you jerks!
We seriously thought you were dead.

114
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,850
You nearly vanished!

115
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,270
That was terrifying!

116
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,880
Goodness! That was bad for my heart.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,320
Uh, not that I have a heart.

118
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,710
It's the morning sun!

119
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,170
I'm not afraid of the sunrise anymore!

120
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,130
I have a shadow!

121
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,140
I can kiss goodbye to life in the dark forest!

122
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,680
Hurray! Hurray!

123
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,060
It looks like all of them are okay, too.

124
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,690
We nearly ceased to exist
when the morning light hit us,

125
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,940
but our bodies were fully restored when

126
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,860
our shadows returned just in the nick of time.

127
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,270
It's probably along the same lines of
how Moria could alter a body's shape

128
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,800
by manipulating its shadow.

129
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,490
If I make his shadow round...

130
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,790
...Oars will turn into a ball!

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
Oars Ball!

132
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,090
All I know is that our bodies
and shadows have to match.

133
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,330
Relax! This is the only time we're ever gonna have the fun

134
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,560
of losing our shadows.

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,730
Anyway, I'm just glad we didn't lose anyone...

136
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,290
All of a sudden, I feel totally wiped out.

137
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
There any cola around here?

138
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,730
All of the strange creatures and phenomena
we've seen since coming ashore

139
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,410
were nothing more than
a ruse put on by Moria.

140
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,950
Now that he has been defeated,
there is nothing left on this island.

141
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,330
Just like waking from a nightmare in
the morning, everything has vanished.

142
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,940
I swear, this was one nasty haunted mansion!

143
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,080
Hey! Hey! Wake up, Absalom!

144
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,000
Come on, Absalom!

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,750
Hey, get up!

146
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,600
Lola!

147
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Knock it off! I'm not going to marry you!

148
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,740
Don't make a scene!

149
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,680
She has already lost her shadow.

150
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,650
Hogback?

151
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,410
For the record, what happened to me?

152
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,360
I have no idea what happened to you!

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,820
I'd wager someone defeated you. Pathetic!

154
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,420
But more importantly,
I have bad news about Moria-sama...

155
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
What?!

156
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,800
Straw Hat defeated Moria-sama?!

157
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,450
Shh! Not so loud! Lower the volume!

158
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,680
You're being loud!

159
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,640
Why are you so riled up, Hogback?
You should be called Rileback.

160
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,260
Thriller Bark is of no use to me now,

161
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,820
but I don't plan on spending
the rest of my days as a loser.

162
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,660
What do you want to do?

163
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,960
Well...

164
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,480
Didn't Luffy shrink back there?

165
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
He told me that after he uses the Giant Gear,

166
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,130
his body shrinks for however
long he used that gear.

167
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,410
Don't you think Luffy's new fighting
style is too hard on his body?

168
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm worried...

169
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,670
If the enemies waiting ahead of us
only continue to get stronger,

170
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,470
he's gonna keep pushing himself!

171
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,770
We need to pull our own weight better.

172
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,980
You're right.

173
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,910
Whoa, a zombie!

174
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,780
One of them still has its shadow!

175
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,760
No, I'm a severely injured old man.

176
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,720
That's confusing! Just pass
yourself off as a zombie!

177
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,520
Aren't you the old man
we met at the graveyard?

178
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,400
I can't believe it! I never dreamed I would

179
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,140
see the day I could walk under the sun again.

180
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,360
Thank you! How can I ever repay you?

181
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,570
Hey! Grandpa Spoil!

182
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,350
Gramps!

183
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,030
Honorary President of the Victim Association!

184
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,360
Oh, guys! So you pulled through?

185
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,940
Gramps, are you all right?

186
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,830
Yeah!

187
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,900
You know each other?

188
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,590
Oh! Come to think of it,
we still haven't thanked you.

189
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,580
We're grateful from the bottom of our hearts!

190
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,870
Sorry for all the trouble we've caused you.

191
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,760
When we saw all the mayhem you caused,

192
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
we figured if you couldn't do it, no one could!

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank you, guys.

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,770
No one in Thriller Bark's Victim Association...

195
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,520
...will ever forget the debt we owe you!

196
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,070
Thank you very much!

197
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,770
If there is anything you'd like,
please say the word!

198
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,700
There isn't much,
but we have some food reserves.

199
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,780
Better yet, you're welcome to marry me!

200
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,200
--We'll pass!
--Five men turned her down all at once!

201
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,630
She's been rejected 4,449 times!

202
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,120
You really don't need to thank us...

203
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,500
Don't say that!

204
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,620
Remember what Luffy said, Gramps?

205
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,420
--I'm especially interested in you!
--We simply fought to suit our own needs.

206
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,520
--Will you marry me?
--We just saved you while we were at it.

207
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,360
How could you say that?!
They actually want to thank us!

208
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,060
Yeah! You should listen to her, Bro!

209
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,890
Let us do something for you!

210
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,520
We don't care if you
saved us on the side or not!

211
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,740
We're grateful that you defeated Moria.

212
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,500
I know, right?

213
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,900
Uh, your eyes...

214
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,740
I know! Why don't you swipe
all of Moria's treasure?

215
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,340
We'll load it onto your ship for you!

216
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,160
Oh, it's already on...

217
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,350
Oh, yeah! I forgot about something important!

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,210
What is it?

219
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,010
I had totally forgotten about him...

220
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,010
What's the matter?

221
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,570
We've got a problem!

222
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,360
I see...

223
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,610
It sounds as though my fears were justified.

224
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,120
So it would seem.

225
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,260
Who is that?

226
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,930
There he is...

227
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,570
Everyone, remain calm and hear me out.

228
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,900
During our fight with Moria...

229
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,240
...I forgot to mention this.

230
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,370
There is one more member on this island...

231
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,740
...of the Seven Warlords!

232
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,520
Wha--?!

233
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,080
What did you say?!

234
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,090
That's a...

235
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,140
...Warlord?!

236
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,150
Th-That's messed up!

237
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,780
What are two of the Seven Warlords
doing on the same island?!

238
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,110
We have finally found a
replacement for Crocodile.

239
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,500
It would look bad if another one of the
Seven Warlords needed to be replaced.

240
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,490
Is he still breathing, even if barely?

241
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,590
I don't know.

242
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,170
If he is still alive, I would
like to wait for his recovery

243
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,850
and let him retain his position as one
of the Seven Warlords for a while.

244
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,180
We can take further measures later.

245
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,780
If we lose one Warlord after the next,
the title will cease to demand respect.

246
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,230
This information must not get out to the public.

247
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,070
I swear, those pirates
cause nothing but trouble.

248
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,760
I recognize him!

249
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,670
Nearly as large as Moria,
that pirate was called the "Tyrant."

250
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,830
He's Bartholomew Kuma!

251
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,670
That's Tyrant Kuma?!

252
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,880
You mean the pirate whose
cruelty knows no bounds?!

253
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,090
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

254
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,520
Do not leave witnesses to testify
that Straw Hat defeated Moria.

255
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,170
The World Government is
assigning you a special mission:

256
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,400
Annihilate everyone on the island,
including the Straw Hat Crew.

257
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,470
That will be easy.

258
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,530
I just heard something!

259
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,650
H-He just said "annihilate."

260
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,130
Whoa, wait! Is he gonna annihilate...

261
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,320
...all of us?! Why?!

262
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,560
Give me a break!

263
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,780
We just got free from Moria's power!

264
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,240
No way! We can't fight two Warlords in a row!

265
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,300
It took all we had just to defeat Moria.

266
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,660
Guys, get back! I'll take him on!

267
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,920
Be careful! He uses some sort of power!

268
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,940
I saw someone vanish when
he touched her with his hand.

269
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,500
Negative Ghost!

270
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,090
And Special Hollow!

271
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,560
Th-The people he touches vanish?!

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,630
S-Scary!

273
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,800
And he can also warp.

274
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,130
Aren't you the Cat Burglar?

275
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,330
You're part of the Straw Hat Crew!

276
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,080
Is it true that Monkey D. Luffy
has an older brother?

277
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,780
Eh?!

278
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,090
What gives?! He got up there
in the blink of an eye!

279
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,680
We've got a freak on our hands!

280
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,700
His hands... are dangerous!

281
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,560
What?!

282
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,640
He's here!

283
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,060
He's huge!

284
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,110
When'd he get down here?!

285
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,080
I see. I'd definitely call that warping.

286
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,740
Damn it! We were finally set free!

287
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,040
There is no way I'm gonna die here!

288
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,910
Right! I'll never let someone stand
between us and our voyage ever again!

289
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,430
Guys, get him!

290
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,120
Yeah, you heard them!

291
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,340
Let's get him!

292
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,060
Stop, men! You don't stand a chance!

293
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,960
He pierced through the whole group
without even touching all of them...

294
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,820
D-Darn it!

295
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,320
Pirate Hunter Zoro...

296
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,280
I will start with you.

297
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,330
What is with the padding
on the palms of his hands?!

298
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,330
It repels all of my attacks!

299
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,750
It is my ability. Your time's up.

300
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,430
"When it rains, it pours."

301
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,150
I accept your challenge!

302
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,420
If I die, then that shows the limit of my ability.

303
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,260
On the next episode of One Piece!

304
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,150
"It Repels Everything!
Kuma's Paw-Paw Power!"

305
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,510
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
