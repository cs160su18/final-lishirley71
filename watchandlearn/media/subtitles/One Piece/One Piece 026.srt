2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,690
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,790
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,950
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,700
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,460
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
We are!

24
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,310
"Zeff and Sanji's Dream;
The Illusory All Blue"

25
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,010
Ghin!!

26
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,970
No matter how incredible he was
in the past, he's now a mere cook.

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,720
It's easy to blow his brains out.

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,060
You want to save this man,
right, Sanji-san?

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,320
Please, leave the ship without a fight.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't want to kill you.

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,970
Leave the ship?

32
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,220
No way!

33
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,130
Man, do you look stupid,
you damn geezer.

34
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,810
If you're like that, you can't set
a good example for the fighting cooks.

35
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,690
Hmph! I don't need a lecture
from a little brat.

36
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,020
Where do you get off calling me
"little brat," you damn bastard?!

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,400
Quit treating me like a kid already!

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,030
That darn Sanji...

39
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,570
He sure isn't gonna
forsake Owner, is he?

40
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,270
Ghin! Point that gun at me.

41
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,460
Are you stupid?! You'll die!

42
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,370
Maybe...

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,360
Sanji-san... Why?!

44
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,210
If you want to die so bad,
I'll kill you in a refined way...

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,910
Don't move if you don't want
your Owner's head blown off.

46
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,850
The Absolutely Natural Pearl... Surprise!

47
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,410
Sanji! Why aren't you dodging?!

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,470
If I did, that damn underling
would pull the trigger.

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,170
Why? If you abandon this restaurant,

50
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,610
everyone's life will be saved.
It's a no-brainer, isn't it?!

51
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,740
This restaurant is that
damn geezer's treasure!

52
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,570
I took everything away
from that damn geezer...

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,640
His power...

54
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,320
His dream...

55
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,260
So... I don't want that damn
geezer to lose anything else!!

56
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,440
Sanji! Watch out!!

57
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,520
Pearl... Cymbals!

58
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,050
Sanji!!

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,820
The All Blue?

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,680
Yeah!

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,180
It's a legendary sea.
It's definitely out there somewhere!

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,660
Don't be silly! Though there
is a legend like that.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,580
Well, we're seafaring cooks, so we've
all dreamed of that sea at one point.

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,050
Right? I'll definitely
find that sea some day!

65
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,540
You say you'll find it, but...

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,510
Do you know what kind of place
the All Blue is to start with?

67
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes, I do! Don't insult my intelligence!

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,860
The East Blue, West Blue,
North Blue, and South Blue...

69
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,210
A sea where fish from
all four seas live...

70
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,960
That's the All Blue.

71
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,420
To seafaring cooks,
that's an irresistible paradise!

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,920
That's my dream!

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh, yeah! There's all sorts of seafood
from all over the world in that sea.

74
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,770
Cooks would be itching for
the chance to show their skills!

75
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,980
Yeah. It's worth risking your
life to look for that sea.

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,820
--That is, if such a sea exists...
--What?

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,190
There's no way a miracle sea
like the All Blue could exist...

78
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,340
It's obvious if you just
give it a little thought...

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,860
It's probably a big lie told by some
daydreaming cook somewhere...

80
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,980
Now, enough with the silly stories.
Go collect plates, Sanji!

81
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,000
Ahh... How wasteful...
leaving this much food...

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,010
This one has barely been touched.
I was sure they'd like it.

83
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,600
Customers these days
sure are pampered.

84
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,580
You guys stop eating
the customers' leftovers.

85
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,480
I ditched food that
looked rotten earlier.

86
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,030
Saying things like that shows you're
still just halfway to being a cook.

87
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,330
Don't forget we're seafaring cooks.

88
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,760
The sea is an unpredictable place,
so it's best not to waste food.

89
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,430
Why don't you have some, too, huh?

90
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,890
I don't want it!

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,140
Everyone, please calm
down! Calm down!!

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,200
Pirates!

93
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,440
Pirates?!

94
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,290
That ship is... The Cook Pirates...
Red Foot Zeff's ship!

95
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,920
So they came back
from the Grand Line!

96
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,690
I take it you're the pirate captain
Red Foot Zeff. How can I help you?

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,790
Steal!

98
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,080
Steal all the valuables from them!

99
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,840
Dammit! I'm not gonna be killed!

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm not gonna be killed
by bastards like them!

101
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,760
Whoa!

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,460
What's this kid?

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,930
Hey, kid. Don't swing things
like that around. It's dangerous.

104
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,940
I'm bleeding. It's a serious injury.

105
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,420
Shut up! I'm not gonna be killed
by bastards like you!

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,610
Sanji!

107
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,880
Stop it! Don't fight back!

108
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,850
Seems he's got a death wish.
Kill that brat already!

109
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,720
I don't want to die! If I'm
gonna be killed by you bastards,

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
I'd rather kill you first!

111
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,100
Sanji!

112
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,140
Boy, you did it, Captain.

113
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,380
You have no mercy.

114
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,020
I'm not gonna die!

115
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,230
I...

116
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,680
I will find the All Blue some day!

117
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,230
He said "All Blue"!

118
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,480
What an ambitious goal!

119
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,160
Captain, tell him... that it didn't
exist even in the Grand Line.

120
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,910
That idiot! He's still
spouting that nonsense...

121
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,690
I'm not gonna...

122
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,470
I'm not gonna be killed by damn
pirates in a place like this!

123
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,830
Captain! Let's withdraw!
This storm is bigger than we expected!

124
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,700
Okay, guys! Hurry up
and take the treasure on board!

125
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,170
We're withdrawing!

126
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,780
Sanji!

127
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,370
Dammit!

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,830
Captain!!

129
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,100
That damn brat!

130
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,310
Captain!!

131
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,330
Why'd you do that for just one brat?!

132
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,350
So you've come to, little brat?
You're very lucky.

133
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,380
Pirate! Ow, ow, ow...

134
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,760
There's no way you can move!
Whose kicks do you think you took?

135
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,440
What about the ships?

136
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,480
Who knows? The sea was very rough.

137
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,850
I wouldn't be surprised if
they were completely destroyed.

138
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,380
We're the only ones
who washed up here.

139
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,300
There's no fruits or animals
on this rocky mountain.

140
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,770
There're at least fish in the sea,

141
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,240
but since the rock has
been curved by the waves,

142
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,130
we won't be able to come back up
once we go down. Isn't that sad?

143
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,940
Hmph! It's all your fault!
I'll kill you!

144
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,610
Just keep complaining. We have no
choice but to wait for help anyway.

145
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,660
If no one comes, we'll just
dry up and turn into skeletons.

146
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,620
A skeleton?! I will...

147
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,620
That bag over there is your share.

148
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,390
What?

149
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,800
That's the food that
luckily washed up here.

150
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,060
It's 5 days worth of food
at most if you eat normally.

151
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,810
Use your head and eat.
Good thing that we're both cooks.

152
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,210
Wait a second! Is that your share?!

153
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,100
It's huge... at least three
times as large as mine!

154
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:03,480
Of course! I'm an adult.
My stomach is larger than yours.

155
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,130
You should be grateful that
I'm even sharing food with you.

156
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,090
Don't expect any pity from me.

157
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,500
You damn geezer!

158
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,420
You watch the other side of the sea.

159
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,630
As soon as you see a ship, let me know.

160
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,390
Until then, we won't be in contact at all

161
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,860
because that'd be a waste of energy.

162
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,460
Good luck.

163
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,660
That damn geezer!

164
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,150
I'm not gonna let him
know even if I see a ship.

165
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,590
It'll be fine.
I have 5 days worth of food.

166
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,630
If I have 5 days, there'll definitely
be a ship or two passing by.

167
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,580
But just in case, I'll divide
them up for 20 days for now.

168
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,370
If I have 20 days, there'll
be a ship passing by for sure.

169
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,290
It'll be all right.
I'll definitely survive. It's easy!

170
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,610
No ship passed by today.

171
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,670
That's all right. I'll just have to
be patient for a couple more days.

172
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,380
I don't wanna die...

173
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,130
This is the last piece of bread...
It's gotten moldy...

174
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,970
Ahh... How wasteful...
leaving this much food...

175
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,820
You guys stop eating
the customers' leftovers.

176
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,560
I ditched food that
looked rotten earlier.

177
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,640
Why don't you have some, too, huh?

178
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,990
I don't want it!

179
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,970
My last piece of bread...

180
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,360
I wonder... if that damn
geezer already died...

181
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,660
He's still alive...

182
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,440
And there's food, too...

183
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,520
There's still that much...

184
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,380
There's that much food!

185
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,230
I'll take it no matter what.

186
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,410
It was all his fault to begin with!

187
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,320
I want to live!

188
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,260
What did you come here for,
little brat?!

189
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,470
Did you see a ship or something?

190
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,970
I came to steal your food.

191
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:38,330
If you think you can kill me, go ahead.
I'll die if I don't eat anyway.

192
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,940
To think you to have this
much food all to yourself...

193
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,870
What?

194
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,210
Didn't I tell you that we wouldn't
be in contact until we saw a ship?

195
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,080
Why? This is all treasure...

196
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,640
It's odd that we can't eat
when we have money.

197
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,740
Hey... This bag is filled with treasure...

198
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,520
What is this?!
What's the meaning of this?!

199
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,730
Where's your food?
You didn't eat anything until today?

200
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,460
Hey! Say something!

201
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,170
What happened to your leg?

202
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,920
That time...

203
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,860
So it wasn't a dream...
In order to save me, you...

204
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,700
What about the food? Did you
give me all the food you had?

205
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,660
That's right.

206
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,620
Without that leg, you won't be
able to be a pirate any more!

207
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,040
I guess...

208
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,290
Why? I didn't ask for your help!

209
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,690
I can't think of any reason
for you to be kind to me!

210
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,300
Why? Why did you?!

211
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,650
Because you...
you had the same dream as me.

212
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,820
The All Blue...

213
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,240
But... even your men
said it doesn't exist...

214
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,400
Of course it does!

215
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,130
When the time comes,
head to the Grand Line.

216
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,040
The All Blue surely exists there.

217
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,420
As you see, I can't be a pirate any more,

218
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,130
but this time, you can go and find it.

219
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,330
H-Hey! Geezer, don't die!

220
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,720
Don't just do as you please
and die as you please!

221
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,480
I wonder...

222
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,940
I wonder how many people
died cursing the sea...

223
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,600
...the grandness of the sea...

224
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,850
I've experienced crises like
this where I couldn't eat.

225
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,580
And each time I wish...

226
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,690
...that there was a restaurant
in the middle of the sea...

227
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,690
Restaurant?

228
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,160
Yeah. I was thinking that if
I could leave this place alive,

229
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,050
I'd build a restaurant as
my final purpose in life...

230
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,170
All right, then, I'll help
you do that. So don't die!

231
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,840
Ha! It's impossible for
a weak little brat like you!

232
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,510
I'll become strong, too!

233
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,440
So... don't die!

234
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,840
Hey!!

235
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,510
Help!! Help the geezer!

236
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,790
Help the damn geezer!!

237
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,620
Hey!! Hey!! Hey!!...

238
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,170
That damn geezer gave up
his leg so that I could live.

239
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,780
Wha?!

240
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,740
I... I can't repay the damn
geezer for his kindness

241
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,210
unless I risk my life for him, too!

242
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,180
Why do you get up... Sanji-san?

243
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,060
In order for this place to be
a restaurant as long as possible...

244
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,030
That idiot...
Is he trying to get killed?

245
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,290
You damn brat!

246
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,470
Ha! That's such a refined line.

247
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,280
But this restaurant will be closed now...

248
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,030
...and it will change into a pirate ship!

249
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,410
Stop it, you idiot!
Keep your hands off of them!

250
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,930
What's he trying to do?!

251
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,560
Gum-Gum...

252
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,430
...Battle-Axe!!

253
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

254
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

255
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

256
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

257
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

258
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

259
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

260
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,980
Though they call themselves the
strongest pirate group in the East Blue,

261
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
it was just because they had so many
pirates. That's all. Right, pops?

262
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,310
You talk very candidly.

263
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,650
Look. It seems like Ghin
can't defeat Sanji, either.

264
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,320
Not quite.

265
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,650
What're those weapons that
look like skewered dumplings?

266
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,570
He wasn't an underling?

267
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,150
On the next episode of One Piece!

268
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,490
"Coolheaded, Coldhearted Demon;
Pirate Fleet Chief Commander Ghin"

269
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,960
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
