00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,570
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,610
The words he uttered
just before his death

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,810
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,260
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,850
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,640
Now everyone is in
search of romanticism!

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,500
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,810

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,040

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,990
It's not our way to worry

Since the day that the dream began

54
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,570
the future that I'm
aiming at hasn't changed

67
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,390
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,720
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has
ever fully explored it

71
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,800
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,510
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

74
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,580
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,450
I'm gonna become the
King of the Pirates!

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,420
The Straw Hats finally
entered the New World,

78
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,560
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
and landed on Punk Hazard;

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,870
They learned about the ruler
of the island and the puppeteer

82
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,700
of Shinokuni - Caesar Clown's motive

83
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,440
and along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,170
were drawn into a climactic battle

85
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,510
which ended with Caesar's defeat.

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,940
Finally, they beat
Doflamingo's subordinates

87
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,410
Baby 5 and Buffalo.

88
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,190
"A Touching Reunion!
Momonosuke and Kin'emon!"

89
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,270
Listen, you damn pirates!

90
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,420
The tanker is yours!

91
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,010
And this is the line
between good and evil!

92
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,850
So don't think of crossing it!
Got that, Straw Hats?!

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,690
Who told you to do
such a childish thing?

94
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,160
What I said was
"Don't make friends with the pirates."

95
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,650
Then it's better to just shut them out,
Vice Admiral Smo!

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,430
But it doesn't apply to the medics!

97
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,310
I got a connection to the G-5 base.

98
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,000
We're gonna wait to be picked up here.

99
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
Yes, sir!

100
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,160
What?!

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,150
Brownbeard, you're turning yourself in?!

102
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,520
We became friends after all.

103
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,030
Seems like he has
performed poisonous drug

104
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,420
experiment on us, too, a little bit.

105
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,790
And they said they're gonna treat me
if I allow myself to be arrested.

106
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,600
I see.

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,430
Hey hey, Straw Hat!

108
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,400
I just told you not to
come across the line!

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,710
You're not listening!

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't care! You guys just made it up!

111
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,610
Well,

112
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,380
it's better to go to prison than let

113
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,470
Caesar do whatever he wants to us.

114
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,950
And my people are all gone so...

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,450
It felt so good when I
saw you knock Caesar out!

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,690
Thank you!

117
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,680
Here.

118
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,100
By the way, what are we making?

119
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,350
A stove.

120
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,950
It's so big.

121
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,880
We have so many people here.

122
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,840
I have to use a big pot so I need a big stove.

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,170
I see.

124
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, Kin'emon-san!
It's so painful to see you like that!

125
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,890
I can't turn my eyes towards him!
Even though I don't have eyes!

126
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,950
1, 2, 3!

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,990
Okay, pull!

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,280
1, 2! 1, 2!

129
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,970
Honestly! If we were
gonna use this tanker,

130
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,360
you should've told me!

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,140
If I knew that I'd have to fix it,

132
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,840
I wouldn't have fought them here!

133
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,200
What?

134
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,910
Hand the children over to the Navy?

135
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,720
Yes!

136
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,390
They ended up

137
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,030
like that because the
Navy was in charge!

138
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,590
Am I wrong?!

139
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,290
Because you people were irresponsible,

140
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,860
the children had to go through
such a terrible time.

141
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,140
It must've been very painful for them.

142
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,570
I promised them!

143
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,210
Let's help these children!

144
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,110
You can't turn your back
on a child crying for help!

145
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,400
I will save them!

146
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,530
So...

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,200
All I can do is apologize.

148
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,180
But I'll take full responsibility.

149
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,520
As for their treatment,
I'll ask Vegapunk for assistance

150
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,520
and look after them until
they're fully recovered.

151
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,490
And I'll take them to their
parents safely at any cost!

152
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
So...

153
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,120
Please!

154
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,590
Leave the children up to me!

155
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,680
Law said "Whatever you
do, don't look inside"

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,940
but I wonder if they are really okay?

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,780
What is he gonna do to them?

158
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,750
What's wrong?!

159
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,440
What?!

160
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,890
Why is he screaming?
What's going on?

161
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,930
Luffy!

162
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,840
Y-You have to stop him!

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,290
What?

164
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,240
He's a murderer!

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,450
What?! A murderer?!

166
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,590
I am a murderer, too!

167
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,990
Who is a murderer?

168
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,050
It's Law!

169
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,160
Tra-guy?

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,750
What's going on there?

171
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,290
I-I murdered somebody, too!

172
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,840
I mean, Kin'emon-san
was already dead but...

173
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,810
I broke his body!

174
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,880
He's dead and now broken?!

175
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Dead and broken?!

176
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,740
Wh-Wh-What should I do?!

177
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,050
What can you do?!

178
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,160
He's broken - you can't do anything!

179
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
What if we stick them back together?!

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,620
Idiot! It's not gonna help!

181
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,620
Momonosuke!

182
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,930
Why are you alive?!

183
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,310
What are you doing, Sanji-san?!

184
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,680
I don't know!

185
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,410
You said he was dead
but he was alive!

186
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,520
But you didn't have to kick him!

187
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,890
I did it on the spur of the moment.
What's wrong with that?

188
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,430
It's all wrong.

189
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,990
Hey, look at him!

190
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,920
The guy who they thought was
killed by the gas was alive!

191
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,390
I'm glad, Kin'emon-san!

192
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,410
I thought you were...

193
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,700
Father!

194
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,660
Mo...

195
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,810
Momonosuke!

196
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,210
Father!

197
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,550
Father!

198
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,820
Momonosuke!

199
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,220
I can't believe you're okay!

200
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,770
What? Momonosuke?

201
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,520
Oh yeah, he said he used to be a human.

202
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,680
So he was the Momonosuke-san

203
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,880
who Kin'emon-san had been looking for!

204
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,260
Uh-huh!

205
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,200
You are naked!

206
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
What?!

207
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,640
Poof!

208
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,860
A CHILD FROM THE WANO KINGDOM
(KIN'EMON'S SON) - MOMONOSUKE

209
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,750
That's how a kid from
the Wano Kingdom looks!

210
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,180
You look good in a kimono!

211
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,810
But, Father,

212
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,490
how did you know that I was... here...

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
Momonosuke! Are you alright?!

214
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,630
I'm...

215
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,810
not hungry...

216
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,540
Momonosuke?!

217
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,470
Law! Show yourself, Law!

218
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,910
What did you do to the children?!

219
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,730
If you hurt them in any way, I...

220
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,590
That's why I told you
not to look inside.

221
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Those kids...

222
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,430
...I sliced them up.

223
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,210
It's a drug.

224
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,480
They still have to go through
a long, painful treatment.

225
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,370
Oh, Racoon-chan!

226
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,070
Racoon-kun!

227
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,650
Is everybody okay?!

228
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,040
The young man with a fur hat just...

229
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,580
...Cut out the bad
parts from our bodies!

230
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,380
What?

231
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,850
I was scared but I feel good now!

232
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,770
Our bodies' got all chopped
up and it was fun!

233
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,690
I'm hungry!

234
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,370
I see.

235
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,420
Mocha hasn't woken up yet.

236
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,740
She fought for us, didn't she?

237
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,550
I had no idea that
the Master was such a bad person.

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,590
I remember vaguely that

239
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,180
Mocha spewed up blood
and passed out!

240
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,620
Hey, Racoon-kun.

241
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm a reindeer.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,010
Is she gonna be okay?

243
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,230
She can go home with
us, right, Racoon-kun?!

244
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,640
Of course!

245
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's get out of this
nightmare and go home!

246
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,850
Where is the young
woman with orange hair?

247
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,340
She said she's gonna take us home.

248
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,830
We want to say "Thank you" to her!

249
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,780
Hi!

250
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,550
We Navy are going to take
care of you all from here!

251
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,420
What?! No!

252
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,110
--What about the robot?!
--The bouncy guy?!

253
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,670
The spiral-eyebrowed guy?!

254
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,400
Smells good! I wonder
what Sanji is making.

255
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,910
Can't wait!

256
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,580
Okay! Now it's standing straight!

257
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,650
Let's do a super quick fix!

258
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,570
Nami?

259
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,530
Have you come to terms with the Navy?

260
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,280
Uh-huh.

261
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,530
I'll leave them up to the Navy.

262
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,440
Even if I commit myself to saving them,

263
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,850
we're pirates. It could cause them trouble.

264
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,280
The most we can do

265
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,540
is get wrongly accused
for kidnapping as always.

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,120
They're in better hands!

267
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,060
You're right. And...

268
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,510
...I have this thing for the
eyes of female Navy soldiers.

269
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,140
Female soldiers?

270
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,990
Uh-huh.

271
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,610
They make me feel at ease.

272
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,650
Oh yeah!

273
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,950
Your mother was a Navy
soldier, wasn't she?

274
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,620
It's always better to get help

275
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,290
from a strong, warm-hearted female soldier!

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,710
That's true!

277
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,970
You have no right to say it!

278
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,300
No, you said it!

279
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,310
New Kama Kempo Technique!

280
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,850
99 Vital Recipes!

281
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,490
It'll boost up your cold, weary body!

282
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,300
Hormone soup with sea pork!

283
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,560
Since you guys haven't eaten for days,

284
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,040
start with the soup and eat it slowly.

285
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600
Yum-yum!

286
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,000
You're starving, aren't you, Momo?

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,310
Sanji is the best cook!

288
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,930
I-I don't want it!
I'm not hungry at all!

289
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,980
Hey, wait, you!

290
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,710
What're you gonna do with the bowl?!

291
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,260
Even if you're a kid,
I can't stand anyone who wastes food!

292
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,700
I said I don't want it!

293
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,390
See? Your stomach is growling!

294
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,060
No, it's not! I'm not hungry and...

295
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,970
...I'm not gonna eat this!

296
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,220
Don't!

297
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,390
I'm going to eat!

298
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,340
What?

299
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,030
H-Hey!

300
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,670
Delicious!

301
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,620
What is this?! I feel
like my energy's back!

302
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,370
Let me try this!

303
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,460
And this!

304
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,590
I can't believe how good this is!

305
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,420
Father...

306
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,490
Let's accept their kindness!

307
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,190
In fact, they saved my life!

308
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,130
You can trust them!

309
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,270
I can... trust them?

310
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,960
You haven't eaten anything until today,
have you?

311
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,710
That's my son!

312
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,510
But it must've been hard!

313
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,250
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore!

314
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,720
Let's hope that everybody
else is okay, too!

315
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,790
Now,

316
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,740
let's keep living, Momonosuke!

317
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,100
Uh-huh.

318
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,550
Oh, is it so delicious that
you can't help crying?!

319
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,720
Idiot!

320
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,340
They must've gone through something serious.

321
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,250
What happened to them?

322
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,970
Oh?

323
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,320
You jerks!

324
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,880
What happened to the line
between good and evil?!

325
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,790
We call for a ceasefire, brother!

326
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,840
Then why don't you guys go

327
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,460
get some sake from the tanker?

328
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,420
Gotcha!

329
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,620
Juice, too!

330
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,840
Hey, Straw Hat-ya.

331
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,360
We have to leave in hurry.

332
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,600
We don't have much time to eat here

333
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,700
somebody's coming after us.

334
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,870
Really?

335
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,780
Tell your crew.

336
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,250
All right.

337
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,330
Guys!

338
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,490
Somebody's coming after us.

339
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,210
So...

340
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,340
...you gotta hurry!

341
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,070
It's a banquet!

342
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,260
Cheers!

343
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,730
No!

344
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,420
Stop!

345
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,890
Momonosuke, what are you doing?

346
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,670
Father.

347
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,610
Warriors shouldn't cry
in front of people!

348
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,730
Momo!

349
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,360
What do you want, Luffy?

350
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,800
Hey, it's a banquet!
Why are you crying?!

351
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,540
Laugh! Laugh!

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,900
Cheers, brother!

353
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,680
Yeah!

354
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,740
Look closely!

355
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,450
1, 2, 3!

356
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,650
Here.

357
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,870
Thank you!

358
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,750
It's good!

359
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,450
Get in the line if you wanna eat!

360
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,370
You can have more - there is a lot!

361
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,250
--It warms you up, doesn't it?
--Uh-huh!

362
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,480
I see!

363
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,800
Then I won't let anybody eat the candy!

364
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,570
I wanna go home with everybody!

365
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,390
Mocha!

366
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,050
Mocha!

367
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,010
Law.

368
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,550
I'm sorry that I suspected you earlier.

369
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,440
He told me.

370
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,330
I got better because you treated me.

371
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,800
Thank you!

372
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Vice Admiral Smo-yan!

373
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,910
We're heading back to the island!

374
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:37,980
What happened?

375
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,100
We made Caesar tell us about
the weakness of the deadly gas!

376
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,850
Our colleagues are still alive!
We can save them!

377
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,550
Why is Smoker still alive?

378
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,420
Let's go, guys!

379
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,220
Yeah!

380
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,420
Law.

381
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,160
I know you don't really
think that I'll keep

382
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,000
my promise with a pirate like you.

383
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,170
But if you really wanted to silence me,

384
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,880
there were several occasions
that you could've killed me.

385
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,390
What are you up to,
taking advantage of Straw Hat?

386
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm taking advantage of him?

387
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,730
Maybe he's taking advantage of me.

388
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,070
Which of the Four Emperors
are you talking about?

389
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,560
The Emperor's name is...

390
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,070
...Kaido, the King of the Beasts!

391
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,690
What?!

392
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,340
As long as Shanks is not the first one to fight,
I have no problem.

393
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,320
Because...

394
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,550
...I plan to beat all
of the Four Emperors!
