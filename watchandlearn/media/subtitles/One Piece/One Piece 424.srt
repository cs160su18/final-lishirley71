2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,840
The time is the
Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,820
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,390
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,010
This is exciting!

46
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The crew, on its way
to the New World,

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,570
will speed along the
Grand Line again today!

49
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,070
After being separated
from his friends,

50
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,540
Luffy comes to the rescue his brother
Ace who has been captured by the Navy

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,360
by sneaking into Impel Down -
the greatest prison in the world!

52
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,950
He heard from some prisoners that Ace
would most likely be held on level 5

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,500
and ran into an
unexpected acquaintance!

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,170
I'll change my plan!

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
Now for some chaos!

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,340
I'm with you!

57
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,550
"Break through the Crimson Hell!
Buggy's Chaos-Inducing Plan!"

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,370
Gum-Gum...

59
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,870
Whip!

60
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,870
Stop! Stop, stop!

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,170
No!

62
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,960
Just kidding!

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,050
Chop-Chop
Emergency Escape!

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,690
Prepare to fall and have
your head crushed!

65
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,110
Aerial Tailspin Big Top!

66
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,590
How d'you like that,
you sea gorilla?!

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
No damage at all?!

68
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,540
D-Don't! Stop punching me!

69
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,080
Looks like you've gotten
stronger since we last met!

70
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,060
They're tough! What
kind of animal are they?

71
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,890
They're fighters from the sea called
Blue Gorilla known as Blugori!

72
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,410
Stay sharp! There're
still 4 more...

73
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,870
Well, then! I see you've
taken care of them already!

74
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,790
But I don't have time to
mess around with these!

75
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,480
Wow! He kicked a
lot of Blugori ass!

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,130
--Hey you! Who are you?!
--Let us out!

77
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,510
What's up?

78
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,610
I thought there was
only one escapee.

79
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,230
Yes, there's just one.

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,150
I could be wrong
but I saw two guys.

81
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,630
Anyway, 5 Blugoris have been beaten
in front of community cell #10!

82
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,150
5 of them? It can't be true!

83
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,620
We don't have any prisoners on level 1
who stand a chance against Blugoris!

84
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,410
Whaaat?!

85
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,270
You wanna rescue Ace?!

86
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,870
Yeah.

87
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,680
Shh! Be quiet!

88
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,170
You're the one
who's screaming!

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,200
Hey guys? The key? Please...

90
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,670
Shut up! Keep
your mouth shut!

91
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,110
Do you know Ace?!

92
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,930
Yeah. Unlike you, your
brother was very polite...

93
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,140
Is this really a time
to be partying?

94
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,040
How can you attack Luffy if you
don't even know where he is?

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,350
Don't be such a
spoilsport, Alvida!

96
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,950
Let us enjoy ourselves!

97
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,230
Huh?

98
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,430
Do you wanna see Luffy?
I know where he is!

99
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,140
See? He knows
where Luffy is...

100
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,510
Who the hell are you?!

101
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,060
Hello! Excuse me for
interrupting your banquet.

102
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,420
I was drawn here by the
smell of all this good food.

103
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,150
My name is Ace.
Nice to meet you!

104
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh no no, you don't have to be that
polite. The pleasure is all ours...

105
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,160
That's not what I asked!

106
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,950
I don't care about your
name! Don't mess with me!

107
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,290
Captain! Captain,
he's the "Fire Fist"!

108
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,230
"Fire Fist" Ace! Whitebeard's
Second Division Commander!

109
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,550
Whitebeard?!

110
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,040
What?!

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,430
Oh! You know my father!

112
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,600
That's very...

113
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,010
He's sleeping!

114
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,890
Then we hit it off and
became drinking buddies.

115
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,980
So I feel very sorry about
what happened to him.

116
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,370
That's the foolishness of the Navy
to mess with Whitebeard's crew.

117
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,010
I wanna get to level 5.
That's where Ace is, right?

118
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,410
I don't know! Go by yourself!
I'm no friend of yours!

119
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,540
I'm not going to that
hell hole! See ya!

120
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,980
If you're not willing to
escape, I'll do it on my own!

121
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,090
There's 10 or more navy ships out
there. Are you sure you can make it?

122
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,340
10 or more?

123
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,180
Oh, I get it! They must be
preparing for Whitebeard's attack!

124
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,460
Now isn't the best time.

125
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,940
I'll just kill some time and...

126
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,020
What?!

127
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,540
Oh well, I'll just ask
somebody else!

128
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,150
The key!

129
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,390
No no, it can't be!
It's stupid to even think it!

130
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,660
But maybe...

131
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,010
Alright then, good
luck with your escape!

132
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,010
I'm sure it is!

133
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,850
Wait a minute, Straw Hat!

134
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,330
--What're you...
--There he is!

135
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,100
--Up there!
--They found me!

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,860
Why did you yell?!

137
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,730
H-Hey, that's a beautiful
armlet! Can I have it?

138
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,360
Why're you so interested all of the
sudden?! This was a gift from Nami!

139
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,740
I'll tell you where Ace is!

140
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,570
Really?

141
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes! If you give it to me.

142
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,540
Yeah, in that case!

143
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,460
Yeah!

144
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,170
Okay, first, let's
lose our enemies!

145
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,020
Hold onto my feet!

146
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,840
Your feet?!

147
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,800
Run, Straw Hat!

148
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,050
Don't drop those, Straw Hat!

149
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,760
Let's see how Buggy the Clown's
Chop-Chop power works!

150
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,130
He can chop apart his body and
control each part as he wants.

151
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,350
But the pieces are controllable
only in a limited area and to use his power,

152
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,890
his feet must be on the ground.

153
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,990
Yes! How lucky I am!

154
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,330
I can't believe that I found the treasure
I was looking for in hell like this!

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Captain! Captain!

156
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,100
What do you want?

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,190
Are you really
sure that this is it?

158
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,720
Is this the cave
where Captain John

159
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,240
who acted so cruelly to
protect his treasure hid them?

160
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,630
Yes, it is! Proceed carefully!

161
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,300
O-Okay.

162
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,560
Listen, where there are treasures,
there are usually traps or guards!

163
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
One false move
and you're dead!

164
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,260
Maybe there will be
some kind of monster

165
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,790
or bloody traps like
you'd see in hell!

166
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,860
Alright, let's continue with
the tunnel construction!

167
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,970
Yes, boss!

168
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,310
Oh? You guys must
be the new crew!

169
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,620
Yeah! Boss, I love this job!

170
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,360
Right! All our sweat turns into a part of
the tunnel that will make people smile!

171
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,810
And beer tastes so much
better after hard work!

172
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,730
Enough of this
goody-goody laborer crap!

173
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,000
We kept sailing here and there in the Grand
Line looking for the treasure after that

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,750
but we couldn't
find it anywhere!

175
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,040
To top it all, I was caught in a navy
post while I walked in by mistake

176
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,570
and was shut up
in this prison.

177
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,020
But my luck has
not run out yet!

178
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,350
Run as fast as you
can, Straw Hat!

179
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,020
I'll lead you to the
entrance of level 2!

180
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,120
Level 2? Aren't you listening?
I wanna go to level 5!

181
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,030
Listen to me, Straw Hat! You'll be
unable to go straight to level 5!

182
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,680
In Impel Down, this first
basement is what they call level 1

183
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,330
and as you go down to
level 2, level 3 and so on,

184
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,540
you encounter more vicious
criminals who have been captured.

185
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,510
I've only ever been to level
4 to be tortured by fire,

186
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,180
so I don't know about
the floors below.

187
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,810
But level 5 holds the

188
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,560
extraordinary criminals with bounties
of hundreds of millions or more!

189
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,280
But I heard from some prisoners
that there are more floors below!

190
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,420
They said that there are heinous
monsters whose existences

191
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,660
have been deleted from history!

192
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,410
It's just a rumor but maybe
that's where Ace is!

193
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,370
Anyway, I can only
lead you to level 4!

194
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,590
Alright! Suddenly you're
not such a bad guy!

195
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,920
Yeah, because you said
you'll give me the armlet

196
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,930
that will tell me where
Captain John's treasure is!

197
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,480
I-I shouldn't have
opened my big mouth!

198
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,850
You're a...

199
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,190
Yeah?

200
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,500
...a pretty crappy pirate
to have been caught!

201
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,110
Shut up! Leave me alone!

202
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,710
H-He wasn't even paying attention!
Thank god he's such an idiot!

203
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,120
I didn't know that this armlet
functions as a treasure map!

204
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,370
I had no clue at all!

205
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,790
You were paying attention!
Damn! Then I have no choice!

206
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,800
Alright then, you
can have it now!

207
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,450
You know that it's a treasure map
but you're still gonna give it to me?

208
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,480
Yeah! Rescuing Ace is
more important to me!

209
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,440
And don't you think that I may just take
off with it if you give it to me now?!

210
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,280
No! Because you gave your
word that you'd lead me to Ace!

211
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,280
Don't look at me with
those trusting eyes!

212
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm a sly and worthless man!

213
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,920
You shouldn't
believe a guy like me!

214
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,430
I finally have Captain John's
treasure mark after all this time!

215
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,260
Thank you, Straw Hat!

216
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,530
Now, how the hell
do I get out of here?

217
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh! Is it faster to break
through the wall? I got it!

218
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,110
No, that's not what I...

219
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,370
I wonder how Luffy's doing.

220
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,860
I warned him not to
get into any trouble...

221
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,670
They built this place as a
fort that locks people in.

222
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,700
Don't get in any trouble.

223
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,870
Once they catch you, you'll
never be able to get out.

224
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,220
I know that you're strong

225
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,800
but promise me that you
won't get in any trouble.

226
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,930
Alright! I promise!

227
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,640
Thank you so
much, Hancock!

228
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,750
Hancock...
Hancock ...ncock...

229
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,020
Oh, Luffy! I can hear your
heavenly voice in my heart!

230
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,600
Okay, it's about time!

231
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,610
Mmm! What a
pleasant scream!

232
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,540
Seems like jailers
doing pretty well.

233
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,530
Did you like it,
Hancock-dono?

234
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,620
Oh, you didn't hear it?

235
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,580
Sorry about that!

236
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,260
But there is one more
chance so please do enjoy it!

237
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,930
I don't care about screams! I can't hear
the voice in my heart because of you!

238
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,340
I don't know what I did wrong
but she's stepping on me!

239
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,410
Why? I'm a vice warden!

240
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,170
Don't do that, Hancock-dono!

241
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,080
But I'm kinda enjoying this!

242
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,830
What?

243
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,030
Oops! Did I say
that out loud?!

244
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,640
Who are they?!

245
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,590
That's Buggy the
Clown who escaped...

246
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,670
And who is the other one?!

247
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,340
This is the jailers' room!
Then we shouldn't go this way!

248
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,640
Stop! Straw Fool!

249
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,690
What the hell is this?
A forest in the prison?!

250
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,860
It's a crimson forest!

251
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,530
There are so many people!

252
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,020
They're prisoners!
This is not just a forest!

253
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,330
Leaves are as sharp as blade
because they're Blade Trees!

254
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,160
The grass is actually needles
which prick  your body!

255
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,650
It's called Spike Needle Grass!

256
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,970
Chased by loosed venomous
spiders and jailers,

257
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,150
prisoners run around the forest

258
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:48,190
and get cut by leaves and
grasses which shed their blood

259
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,980
causing them to agonize!

260
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,980
This is level 1 -
the Crimson Hell!

261
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,450
That is Impel Down!

262
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,990
"The Underwater Prison - Impel Down - Level 1
Crimson Hell"

263
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,790
Help me!

264
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,990
I can't stand it!

265
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,520
This is a real hell! Is this the kind
of thing they're doing to Ace?

266
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,230
Yes! Let's just keep falling!

267
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,000
Why?! We're gonna get cut!

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,590
I'm not gonna get cut!
Just shut up and hang on!

269
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,610
Straw Hat! My feet! Throw
them to the ground!

270
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,390
Your feet?

271
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,850
Ah! Okay!

272
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,510
W-What is that?!

273
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,680
Augh! Watch out!

274
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,170
Once I get my feet on the
ground, it's a piece of cake!

275
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,880
We don't need to use stairs
to go down from this floor!

276
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,700
We don't need a key to
open the door to the stairs!

277
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,860
I just remembered that there's a way to
escape the agony of the Crimson Hell!

278
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,380
There's a way out of hell?

279
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
Look! This is it!

280
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,830
It's a hole!

281
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,930
Wow! It's as dark as night!

282
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,480
This is the way out but nobody
wants to escape from here.

283
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,400
Do you know
why, Straw Hat?

284
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,990
Because this hole is
connected to level 2

285
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,830
which is an even
more terrifying hell!

286
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,690
There may be people who try to
escape from hell back to earth

287
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,690
but there aren't people stupid
enough to descend deeper into hell!

288
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,970
Well, this is good for us!
We can just jump down!

289
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,720
Yeah but down below,
there's... No, wait! Hey!

290
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,020
Wow, it's deep! I wonder
what's down there!

291
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,660
Ha! What a hotfoot!

292
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,340
He isn't afraid of anything?

293
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,000
But at least now he can't
stop me if I just take off!

294
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,890
Now I'm free! I finally got the treasure
mark that I always dreamed of!

295
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,000
Find your own way!
Good-bye, Straw Hat!

296
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,430
Down to level 3 or level 4 - it doesn't
matter either way you're a goner!

297
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,810
Stupid Blugori! You can't chop
me because I ate Chop-Chop fruit!

298
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
That's...

299
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,930
...my feet!

300
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,120
No! You got to
be kidding me!

301
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,010
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

302
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,770
Surveillance Room!
There is another guy!

303
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,020
They just fell down to level 2!
Can you look for them?

304
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,360
I got it!

305
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,700
"The Underwater Prison - Impel Down - Level 2
Floor of Wild Beasts From Hell"

306
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,600
W-What's going on?

307
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,970
The beasts unusually agitated!

308
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,450
Are they hungry or something?

309
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,600
I have no energy
left to be afraid.

310
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,870
Either way we're
gonna be their dinner.

311
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,700
Luffy and Buggy fall down to level 2,

312
