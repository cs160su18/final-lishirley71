Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,930
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up heart beat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

42
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

44
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480

burning, intense excitement!

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100

Go along with your curiosity

56
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310
and go wherever you want to
go - that's the adventure

57
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,310

61
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

62
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

63
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa kitto "yume no hate" tsukamitoru

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

65
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

67
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

68
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

69
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

70
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

71
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

72
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,910
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

76
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,060
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

77
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,860
and have come to Dressrosa.

78
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,260
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in
which a winner will get the Flare-Flare Fruit

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,130
as the prize - and won the first round

80
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,970
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law who's

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,320
been captured by Doflamingo.

82
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,610
Meanwhile Kyros, who is now with Luffy,

83
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,280
remembers the gratitude he has for King Riku.

84
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,610
Stay away from him, King Riku-sama!

85
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,110
King Riku-sama!

86
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,060
Come with me!

87
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,900
Finally!

88
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,040
Finally - an unprecedented 1000th victory!

89
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,820
You're here again.

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,010
--Kyros.
--Go away!

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,500
You don't understand!

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,750
No matter where I go,
I'll be a beast...

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,260
...who killed men for the rest of my life!

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,610
I wish...

95
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,340
...everybody would forget about me!

96
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,750
Her name is Rebecca.

97
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,280
I shouldn't touch such an innocent thing!

98
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,640
My hands are tainted!
I don't wanna taint her!

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,450
Your father is a strange man, Rebecca.

100
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,220
You're like an angel, Rebecca!

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,590
I'll be watching over you!
I'll always be by your side!

102
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,400
What's going on?!

103
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,110
"The Operation Failed!
Usoland the Hero Dies?!"

104
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,150
Father-sama!

105
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,930
The palace is on fire!

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,680
What's going on in this country?

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm gonna go to the palace!
Alright, Scarlet? Rebecca?

108
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,430
Father-sama!

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,900
If it gets dangerous here,
go to the Red Flower Field and wait there!

110
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll come and get you at any cost!

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,480
Th-This is...

112
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,980
What happened?!

113
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,060
Open up!
It's me! Kyros!

114
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,560
Is anybody there?!

115
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,900
Guard! Open the gate!

116
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,830
I need to talk to King Riku!

117
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,580
Pirates?!

118
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,210
Brother Kyros!

119
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,650
Lady Viola!

120
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,820
Father-sama is...
King Riku-sama is okay.

121
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,260
What happened?!

122
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,680
It's...

123
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,230
The new king is waiting for you,
Army Commander Kyros.

124
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,390
The new king?!

125
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,040
--Let me lead the way to him.
--What did you do to King Riku-sama?!

126
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,080
Please follow me.

127
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,250
Lady Viola, come with me.

128
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,470
No.

129
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,190
You have to come on your own.

130
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,630
Could I have your weapon?

131
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,970
No, you can't!

132
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,100
Well done-in!

133
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,870
You're really gonna save my brother-in-law's life, too, aren't you?

134
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,060
Of course, we are!

135
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,140
Young Master-sama said
he might be useful-in!

136
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,920
If not, we would've killed him already-in!

137
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,380
So you've been working for the pirates, haven't you?!

138
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,020
We are here. Go on in.

139
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,130
Where's King Riku-sama?

140
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,380
Who are you?

141
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,070
He's here.

142
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh no!

143
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,350
Sea Prism Stone?!

144
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,470
King Riku-sama!

145
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,720
What did you do...

146
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,160
...to this country and the king, pirate?!

147
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,760
The king set fire to the town.
Didn't you see it?

148
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,430
He'd never do such a thing!

149
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,440
Kyros!

150
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,080
Unlock these Sea Prism Stone chains!
I'm not a Devil Fruit eater!

151
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,080
Kyros. I've been hearing good things about you.

152
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,180
They say you're the strongest gladiator in the Colosseum.

153
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,340
Swear fealty to me.

154
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,480
The king has been dethroned and all members of the old royal family will die!

155
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,430
I've already sent my men to your wife and daughter

156
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,660
who are part of the royal line!

157
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,710
Watch what I'm gonna do!

158
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,740
The King Riku Family is
no longer governing Dressrosa!

159
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,910
He cut off his own leg!

160
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,850
Kyros!

161
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,290
A toy?

162
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,130
The toy put the king on his shoulder and escaped-dasuyan!

163
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,500
I got turned into a toy!
What happened to me?!

164
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
Am I dreaming?!

165
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,210
I'm Kyros! King Riku-sama!

166
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,880
--Kyros?
--Yes!

167
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm sorry. It doesn't ring a bell. But...

168
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,970
...I'll never forget what you did for me!
You're a strange toy.

169
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Run!

170
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,760
Scarlet! Rebecca!

171
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,930
Wait for me at the rendezvous point!

172
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,090
TWO DAYS LATER

173
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,170
Nobody knows my name.

174
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,810
Did they all forget about me?!

175
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,090
I've gotta get to the Red Flower Field!

176
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,530
Scarlet and Rebecca are waiting for me!

177
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,510
Scarlet?!

178
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,130
Scarlet!

179
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,520
Scarlet!

180
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,240
Scarlet!!

181
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,740
Scarlet!

182
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,710
Somebody's got shot!
Is it the King Riku Army again?!

183
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,850
Why?!

184
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,590
Why didn't you wait for me?!

185
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,370
I see!

186
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,950
I must've slipped out of your mind, too!

187
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,550
Our promises...

188
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,550
...and memories, as well!

189
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,890
Scarlet!!

190
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,900
Scarlet! Stay with me!

191
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Scarlet! Scarlet!

192
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Scarlet! Stay with me!

193
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know who you are but...

194
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,050
...my daughter is waiting for me, hungry.

195
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,650
Please...

196
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,690
It's me! Kyros!

197
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,040
Please...

198
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,600
Scarlet?

199
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,570
Scarlet!

200
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,280
Scarlet!!

201
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,120
I can't believe I'm losing her like this!

202
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,880
This is hell!

203
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,880
It's terrible!

204
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,250
With these tin arms,

205
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,360
I can't even feel
your warmth as you're dying!

206
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,850
Scarlet!!

207
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,310
Soldier-san!

208
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,740
Soldier-san!

209
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,470
--Soldier-san!
--Oh yes, Lady Viola!

210
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,150
Are you alright?

211
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,330
We have a problem!

212
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,750
I see some enemies coming from the 1st floor!

213
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,610
It's unforgivable!

214
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,730
So that was someone disguised as the Young Master!

215
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,700
The Straw Hats and the others must be above the 2nd floor!

216
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Violet's blood was on the wall!

217
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,990
It's no good.

218
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,490
Rather than being surrounded by enemies on both sides,

219
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,510
should we make
a surprise attack on Doflamingo now?

220
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,370
Usoland and the others can't make it, I guess.

221
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,430
Come to think of it,
you guys are all pirates, aren't you?

222
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,610
Afterwards, I noticed Fraland and Usoland were as well.

223
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,800
Is that a problem for you?

224
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,830
No, I'm a notorious criminal, too.

225
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,710
If we have a common goal, it's nice to work with you.

226
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,640
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

227
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,320
There are some cracks
in the basement of the Colosseum!

228
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,220
All those hundreds of incredibly strong competitors fighting before the finals!

229
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,720
The structure has taken a lot of damage today!

230
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,330
And now, with Burgess's attacks!
This place won't last until it's over!

231
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,900
Shockwave Elbow!

232
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,790
Elbow! Elbow!

233
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,110
--That bastard!
--Stop shooting at us!

234
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,080
Nice!

235
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,020
I'll tell you again and again, Rebecca!

236
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,230
The one who shot and
killed your mother Scarlet...

237
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,230
...was me!

238
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,030
Hey! If you attack her verbally like that,
my barrier doesn't mean anything!

239
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,640
Soldier-san!

240
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,130
I'm hopeless!

241
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,310
Mother-sama, I'm hungry.

242
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,310
I'm gonna go buy something to eat.

243
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Uh-huh!

244
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,850
I'm too angry to even move!

245
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,650
THE TOY HOUSE

246
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,540
Cyborg Franky has been silenced!

247
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,460
U-Usopp! I know you can do it!

248
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,840
Set off the panic already!

249
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,320
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

250
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,830
THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT

251
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,390
Special Attack: Green Star - Rapid-fire!

252
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,700
Don't-know-what-it-is-but-it's-some-kinda Special Attack!

253
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,670
There's a fierce fight in the Executive Tower!

254
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,330
Usopp of the Straw Hats, go for it!

255
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,070
I don't even know your face
but go at it, Usopp!

256
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,850
If you win, I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life!

257
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,950
Go for it!

258
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,220
Go for it!

259
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,660
I don't wanna live as a toy
for the rest of my life!

260
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,620
If you can turn me back,
I won't go after Straw Hat!

261
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,130
I'll become your subordinate or whatever!
Stick to it!

262
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,560
You can have all my money!
I'm counting on you!

263
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,940
Trebol!
Bring Sugar to the palace now!

264
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,280
Relax, Doffy!
There'll be no unexpected problems!

265
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,530
Don't worry, Young Master.

266
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,520
He's not even conscious now.

267
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,830
Usoland!

268
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,050
You can have this poison grape back.

269
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,210
--Oh, the Tatababasco grape!
--Our only hope!

270
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,410
You eat this.

271
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,260
Drop dead.

272
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,540
Whaaat?!

273
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,490
Hey Sugar, what are you doing?!

274
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,700
Keep your senses!

275
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,640
S-Sugar has...

276
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,970
...passed out!!

277
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,520
Usopp creates a never-before-seen miracle!

278
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,360
Toys are turning back into humans one after

279
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,390
another which throws Dressrosa into chaos!

280
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,880
In the midst of all that, Kyros, winner of an unprecedented 3000 matches,

281
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,260
now challenges Doflamingo pouring
his heart and soul into it!

282
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,470
On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Legend is Back! Kyros' All-out Blow!"

283
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,660
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
