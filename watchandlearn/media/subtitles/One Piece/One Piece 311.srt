00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,950
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,730
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,190
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,360
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,460
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
Into the sea!

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,350
Usopp?!

36
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,850
We're gonna be saved! She came to rescue us!

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,730
We've got one more friend, right?!

38
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,280
Chopper! Did you look below?!

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,690
I did!

40
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,870
Cien Fleurs!

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,770
Delphinium!

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm moving! Is Robin doing this?!

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,880
Into the sea!

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,840
Into the sea...!

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,800
Into the sea!

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,060
Follow Luffy!

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,930
Here we go!

48
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,900
Here we go...!

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,810
Into the sea!

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,740
The pirates are jumping into the sea!

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,450
How stupid! There's no way that they
can survive after jumping into this sea.

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,580
Let's go back, everyone!

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,670
Fire!

54
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,390
Back to the seas of adventure!

55
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,270
Get on the Merry!

56
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,320
Merry!

57
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,520
"Everyone Makes a Great Escape!
The Road to Victory Is for the Pirates"

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,110
What're they trying to do?!

59
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,880
There's no way that they'd be
saved after jumping into the sea!

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,710
There should be power
holders among them, too!

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,620
That's suicidal!

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,720
Hey, hold on a sec...

63
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,180
What the heck is that?

64
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,970
It's a ship! From its pirate flag,
it's the Straw Hat Pirates' ship!

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,640
How did it sneak in undetected
by all our battleships?

66
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,580
I don't know who you are, but thanks for...

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,420
What the heck?

68
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,910
--Oof!
--Oof!

69
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,620
Is something wrong, Sanji-kun?

70
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,730
Hmm... Well, Nami-san...

71
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,250
The rope ladder was definitely dropped,
but there seems to be no one here.

72
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,490
What?!

73
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,360
Yaay!

74
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,480
Merry!

75
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,370
Seriously, learn how to swim, brother!

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,190
Now, get on board, power holders!

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,430
Robin-chan!

78
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,430
Throw yourself into my arms!

79
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,730
This is the Merry! It's the Merry!

80
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,810
I really love the Merry!

81
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,910
Merry... Merry...

82
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,020
My Merry is alive!

83
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,990
Why... Why are you so...

84
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,700
If... If I was... If I was more...

85
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,960
I can't believe it! This ship
was dropped into the sea!

86
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,000
Who on earth sailed the ship here?

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,320
We'll talk about it later!
Give us your instructions!

88
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,460
--That's right.
--Let's get out of here!

89
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,630
Hey! What're you doing, Sanji-kun?!

90
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,240
N-Nami-san!

91
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,780
That was close! I thought I was
gonna be killed by the battleships!

92
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,160
Hey, Robin! You saved me! Thank y...

93
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,210
Just leave the rest to us!

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,760
Luffy... and everyone...

95
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
Thank you!

96
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,510
Don't worry about it.

97
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,620
Say stupid stuff like that
after we escape from here.

98
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,670
What do you mean "stupid stuff,"
you damn moss head?!

99
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,500
What do you mean, you damn moss head?!

100
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,290
Shut up! If we die here,
it'll all come to nothing!

101
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,260
Apologize to Robin-chan, you bastard!

102
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,460
He's right! Apologize to Robin!

103
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,950
That's enough!

104
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,260
Hm? Hey, Chopper...

105
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,500
You can move now?

106
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,470
What?

107
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,510
Y-You're right! I'm moving!

108
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,230
I can move now! Zoro!

109
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,340
Apologize to Robin already!

110
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,510
Give up yet?

111
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,020
No! No!

112
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,710
Now, guys! We're gonna
hurry up and get outta here!

113
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,450
Yeah!

114
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,530
Hey, hey... Give me a break!
Are you guys letting them get away?!

115
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,360
If they're getting away anyway,
might as well just blow up Nico Robin!

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,710
But we have to capture her alive!

117
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,620
Admiral Aokiji asked me to tell you that.

118
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,670
All ships! Prepare to fire cannons!

119
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,510
A-Admiral Aokiji did?!

120
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,430
Okay! Aim at them!

121
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,370
All ships! Prepare to fire cannons!
All ships! Prepare to fire cannons!

122
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,880
That was a big lie. I'm not gonna let
them get away. I'm gonna kill them.

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,180
Now that it's come to this,
I'm gonna kill them all!

124
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,050
Hey! Hurry up and load the cannonballs!

125
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,610
So Spandam is alive.

126
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,350
They're gonna fire at us!

127
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,330
Catch the wind from starboard and head east!

128
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,320
We can't! We're completely surrounded!

129
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,290
The number of cannons
aiming at us is overwhelming!

130
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,750
It's impossible that they
would all miss this ship.

131
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
Fire!

132
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,010
Ahh! They're coming!

133
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,930
Hey, are they firing at each other?
None of the other attacks are hitting us, either!

134
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,890
Where are you all aiming?!

135
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,570
There's something wrong! It's like
the cannons are aiming themselves!

136
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,150
Don't give me a weird excuse!

137
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,550
Keep clear!

138
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,230
We can't! We're gonna collide!

139
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,330
It's coming this way! What the hell is going on?!

140
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,760
What's the matter?! What's going on?!

141
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,250
L-Look over there!

142
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,040
What the hell?!

143
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,000
The Gates of Justice started
closing at some point!

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,050
The currents blocked by the
gates are producing whirlpools

145
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,320
and we can't control the rudder!

146
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,770
So that's why our aiming was off the mark!

147
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,980
Don't get swallowed by the currents!

148
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,610
Wh-What the hell is going on?

149
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,690
Put out the fire! Hurry up!

150
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,820
This is it! Everyone, get out of here!

151
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,700
Idiots! Why did you close the gates?
What're you morons doing?!

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,290
The lever to open and close the gates is inside
the third column of the Bridge of Hesitation,

153
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,860
so we couldn't have done anything!

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,170
Whoa! This is more than I expected!

155
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,530
Sanji! Don't tell me you did something earlier!

156
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,130
Yep.

157
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,550
These guys aren't the kind of enemy we
could escape from with just guts, right?

158
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,480
Bingo!

159
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,620
Th-That's amazing, Sanji!

160
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,140
Are you a genius or what?!

161
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,860
We can't go on rejoicing forever.
The whirlpools are a problem for us, too.

162
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,570
Ahh! That's right!

163
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,130
--We're gonna die!
--Shut up, you guys!

164
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:28,250
There was no sea that the Merry
couldn't cross with us on board!

165
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,910
Ohhh...

166
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,210
--That's right! We're counting on you, navigator!
--Nami-san! You're so cool!

167
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,890
Just hang on until I can figure out
the trajectory of the whirlpools!

168
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,190
Leave it to us!

169
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,130
One-Sword Style... Thirty-six Pound Phoenix!

170
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,000
Dammit! I can't do the Hundred-and-eight
version with just two swords!

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
You can just take a break, then.

172
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,550
What'd you say, you jerk?!

173
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,900
H-Hey! They're coming again!

174
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,070
Collier Shoot!

175
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,940
Cien Fleurs! Defense!

176
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,780
Here! I'm returning these to you!

177
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,620
Triple... Flame... Stars!

178
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,070
I wonder if Zoro and the others are okay.

179
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,020
I wonder...

180
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,270
--Chopper!
--Hm?

181
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,400
They're fine, so just focus on steering.

182
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,730
O-Okay.

183
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,540
Dammit! Why?! Why can't you bring down
that puny little ship with seven battleships?!

184
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,790
You useless morons!

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,420
Hey, they're coming your way, Usopp!

186
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,550
Okay! Leave them to me!

187
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,740
I missed one! Sanji, take care of it!

188
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,300
Basses Côte!

189
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,510
Ahhh! I'm gonna fight, too!

190
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,850
You idiot! You can't move, can you?!

191
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,960
He's right, Luffy. Leave this one to us...

192
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,660
...and take it easy!

193
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,040
Ahhh! I don't care what you guys say--

194
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm gonna fight!

195
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,480
I'll give a medal to the one who actually
hits them! So hurry up and hit them!

196
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,080
All ships! Concentrate all
attacks on their back deck!

197
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,170
That's enough, Luffy!

198
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,170
Fire!

199
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,680
Shut up! I'm your captain!

200
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,300
Whoa!

201
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,360
One...

202
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,610
Two...

203
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,530
Three!

204
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,320
Oh, crap! They're bouncing back!

205
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,930
That saved us, captain!

206
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,920
Just as we'd expect from our captain!

207
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,010
Hey! Are you guys demons?!

208
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,880
Victory!

209
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,140
I see it... the road to victory!

210
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,300
Chopper, hard aport at 9 o'clock!

211
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,600
O-Okay!

212
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,560
The pirate ship escaped towards the falls!

213
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,360
Fire! Fire! What're you doing?!

214
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,070
Are you all idiots?! Sink that ship already!

215
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,600
It seems that they caught
the flow of the whirlpools!

216
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,030
They're moving at an incredible speed!

217
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm gonna be useful, too!

218
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,980
Go for it, reindeer!

219
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,200
Go! Speed forth with all your might!

220
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,940
Dammit! Dammit! Those bastards!

221
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,530
With the entire military force
of Enies Lobby at our disposal...

222
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,370
With the power of Buster Call,
as strong as an entire country's military...

223
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,370
Why... Why in the hell can't we...

224
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,330
Why...? Why can't we take a single woman...

225
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,960
...from a puny little band of pirates?!

226
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,740
Chief!

227
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,420
If I hadn't recognized
the value of your existence,

228
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,500
it would've been practically worthless!

229
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,090
There's no hope left for you!

230
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,550
So you were so unhappy it'd make you cry?

231
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,820
Help!

232
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,990
Help...

233
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,320
Clutch!

234
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,250
C-Chief!

235
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,720
--Fight! Fight! Fight!
--All right... it's about time.

236
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,840
Franky!

237
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,740
Could you do that thing?!

238
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,970
Got it!

239
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,310
Everyone, be prepared for a shock.

240
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,270
Block their route! The enemy ship
can't get out of the whirlpools!

241
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,360
It'll be rough on the ship... Sorry about that.

242
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,160
Coup de Vent!

243
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,700
Th-The pirate ship is flying!

244
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,220
Is this really happening?!

245
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,410
They've gone outside of the fleet's range!

246
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,300
Don't underestimate what she's been through!

247
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,760
The Merry flew 10,000 meters high in the sky!

248
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,820
Special Attack! Super Smoke Star!

249
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,350
It's a smokescreen!

250
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,810
Those bastards...!

251
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,270
After them! We bow to nobody in speed!

252
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,790
We can't! We're caught in the whirlpools!

253
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,360
It's taking everything
we've got just to stay afloat!

254
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,410
Fire! Fire!

255
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,530
It seems that Straw Hat and
the others were able to escape!

256
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,720
All right! We'll go back, too!

257
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,500
Did everyone get on board okay?!

258
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,910
Yeah! I put the seriously
injured in the passenger cars!

259
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,920
Okay! Those who're outside, hang on
tight so that you won't be thrown off!

260
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,990
The whole thing is over, huh?

261
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah.

262
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,690
I'd heard rumors,

263
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,860
but I never realized that a Buster Call
was such an inhumane thing.

264
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,020
Well, Enies Lobby was eliminated in the end.

265
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,940
Maybe Iceberg-san will take
some measure of relief from that.

266
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,130
Yeah.

267
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,210
Whoa! You guys, don't come in here!

268
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,240
We never would have
made it without your ropes!

269
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,280
We owe you our lives!

270
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,210
Shut up! Get off of me, you pervs!

271
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,700
You're as innocent as ever.

272
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,730
You really are innocent.

273
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,770
You two... Enough is...

274
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,400
Oh, boy! You've got it tough, huh, Paulie?

275
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,740
Oh, my! We'll take good care of you!

276
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,990
P-Please, I beg you... Get out of here.

277
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,000
Go! Puffing Tom!

278
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,230
I-I didn't realize that you were here.

279
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,920
We'll still pursue them, so...

280
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,990
We can't possibly let it end like this.

281
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,010
To maintain our dignity as the Navy--
no, the World Government--

282
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,610
we'll bring down the Straw Hat Pirates

283
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,810
and we'll bring in Nico Robin, a criminal
of utmost importance, without fail!

284
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,070
Therefore, fleet reinforcements
and additional marines are...

285
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,110
Don't bother.

286
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,230
But...!

287
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,390
We used a Buster Call, an attack as
strong as an entire country's military.

288
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,540
When we see the blunder this fleet
made and the current situation

289
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,080
of Enies Lobby, the symbol
of law, it's quite obvious.

290
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,040
On this matter, we've been
completely defeated.

291
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,980
Is the top of this sheep head here okay?

292
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,670
Yep. That's my seat.

293
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,960
There you go. Be careful not to fall.

294
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,680
Yeah. Thanks, monster granny.

295
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,970
Thanks, Merry.

296
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,140
Thanks to you, we were able to escape.

297
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,150
I never thought that you'd come, Merry...

298
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,610
But when I think about it,
you've always protected us.

299
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,570
I'm so glad that you're our friend.

300
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,560
Thanks, Merry!

301
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,580
At any rate...

302
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,040
...you guys sure did pull one
outrageous stunt back there.

303
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,760
To start with, to think that you shot
through the World Government's flag...

304
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,240
Well... it's not a big deal.

305
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,430
All we did was take back a friend
who was taken away from us.

306
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,390
Thanks for helping us save Robin.

307
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,780
Well, to me, it was no big deal.

308
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,910
Anyway...

309
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,830
...this fight...

310
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,110
...is over...

311
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,030
...and we won!

312
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,090
Yeah!

313
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,460
Merry...

314
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,630
Merry!

315
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,720
Merry...!

316
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,510
Your name is the Going Merry!

317
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,100
And you're one of us!

318
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,510
On the next episode of One Piece!

319
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,230
"Thank You, Merry!
Snow Falls over the Parting Sea"

320
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
