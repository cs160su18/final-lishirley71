00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,740
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,060
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,960
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,470
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,230
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,400
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,150
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,740
Welcome to the Grand Line!

22
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,480
Welcome to our town!

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,090
To the welcoming town, Whisky Peak!

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,200
Pirates! Welcome to our town!

25
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,970
This is delicious!

26
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,970
You're hopeless!

27
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,140
What fun!

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Looks like there're about
100 bounty hunters here.

29
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,830
I'll fight you all...

30
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,240
...Baroque Works!

31
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,040
Humph...! Was it a secret?

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,140
If you know our secrets,

33
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,110
then we have no other
choice but to kill you.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,240
Another gravestone...

35
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,860
...will be added to the Cactus Rocks...

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,060
Kill him!

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,580
H... He disappeared...!

38
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,340
"Explosion! The Three-Sword Style!
Zoro vs. Baroque Works!"

39
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,660
H-He's gone!

40
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,800
Wh-Where the heck did he disappear to?!

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,860
--Ahh!
--What?!

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,730
All right then.

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,390
Shall we?

44
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,910
How dare you mock us?!

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,470
Fire!

46
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,080
Idiots! They shot each other!

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,640
H-He disappeared again!

48
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,020
Darn! Kill him already!
It's just a single swordsman!

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,780
Let me ask you a question.

50
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,990
Are you sure that you need
to add only one gravestone?

51
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,540
There he is!

52
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,830
I-Idiots! Don't!
Are you gonna shoot me, too?!

53
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,500
Stop! Igarappa!

54
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,140
Where did that man disappear to?

55
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,830
Phew.

56
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,630
So that's a shotgun?
That thing sure is dangerous.

57
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,380
It seems he's good enough
that even we must be cautious.

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,360
Does he seriously think that
he can fight all of us by himself?

59
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,880
It's hard to believe
that he challenged us

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,190
even after knowing
we're with Baroque Works.

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,690
Ladies, please come closer...

62
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm gonna sing Usopp Cheer #721!

63
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,580
So the welcoming town, Whisky Peak,
is the bounty hunters' nest, huh?

64
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,760
I thought it might be something like that.

65
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,510
Where did he go?! Find him!

66
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,610
The new recruits that I got in Loguetown,
Yubashiri and Kitetsu III...

67
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,010
This is a good chance to
try you guys out in earnest.

68
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,070
I'm going to go all-out!

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,330
There you are!

70
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,660
Die!

71
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,410
Tsk! Dammit!

72
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,260
First, I'll try Yubashiri.

73
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,350
It's light! This is a good sword!

74
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,770
There he is! This way!

75
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,030
Hold it!

76
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,230
Looks like they found me!

77
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,200
He went up!

78
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,410
Welcome!

79
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Whoa! That thing's dangerous!

80
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,430
This is it for you.

81
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,210
Miss Monday!

82
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,640
Ahh... That was an expensive drink.

83
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
What a waste!

84
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,390
What was that feeling
in my hand just now?!

85
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,500
How sharp this Kitetsu III is!

86
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,470
A legendary sword cuts only
when its master wishes it,

87
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,820
but this one is a problem child.
So this is what a cursed sword is like.

88
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,770
Huh?

89
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,400
Lord have mercy!

90
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,030
I beg you for mercy.

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,490
Lord have mercy! Please save us!

92
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,730
Merciful Lord Blinding Powder!

93
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,500
You should use such a cheap trick
on someone with a pure heart.

94
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,420
I used the back of the blade,
so forgive me.

95
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,850
He went further up!

96
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,600
Corner him!

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,980
He's over there!

98
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,840
Cut him off!

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,710
Go around to the back!

100
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay!

101
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,770
Did someone step on me?

102
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,910
Mademoiselle, would you
care to dance with me?

103
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,630
Darn... Is this all the treasure they have?

104
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,200
Some bounty hunters' nest this is!

105
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,410
Whisky Peak sure is a crappy town.

106
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,140
There's nowhere to escape up there!

107
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,180
S-Stop it!

108
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,810
Help me! Help me!

109
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,500
The ladder's falling!

110
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,380
Ahh! He's jumping over here!

111
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,080
Shoot him!

112
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,130
Two-Sword Style!

113
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,510
Hawk Wave!

114
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,390
Watch out. That place is unstable.

115
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,030
What?

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,870
That was close! It grazed me!

117
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,180
Don't try our patience.

118
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,310
There's no man who can best my strength.

119
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,960
This is the end of you.

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,890
Superhuman...

121
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,060
Brass Knuckles!

122
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,070
We've wast...

123
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,640
Ma-ma...

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,490
We've wasted time,
but we finally settled it. The End!

125
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,330
What?!

126
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,840
M... Miss Monday!

127
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,590
What's the matter, muscle woman?

128
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,210
Didn't you want to have
a contest of strength?

129
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,780
Well?!

130
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,230
Shall we continue, Baroque Works?

131
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,400
Fighting isn't a joke.

132
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,610
M-Miss Monday was overpowered...!

133
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,920
I-Impossible! This can't be true...!

134
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,340
I-I got it! The Navy made a
mistake on that wanted poster.

135
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,610
I see. It makes sense if this guy has
a 30 million-Berry bounty on his head.

136
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,320
He is the real captain.

137
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,170
Right. I thought it was strange
that such a namby-pamby guy

138
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,660
was worth 30 million Berries.

139
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,890
But, even so, how disgraceful...

140
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,850
If we lose against one pirate swordsman,

141
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,280
we'll be held responsible since
the boss put us in charge of this town.

142
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,900
It seems that it's finally our turn to fight.

143
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,640
You may know this,
but with members of Baroque Works,

144
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,290
the smaller his number, the higher
his level and destructive power are.

145
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,980
The three of us, Mr. 9,
Mr. 8 and Miss Wednesday

146
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,350
are agents with a single digit number,

147
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,970
which means we're powerful people

148
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,430
who are beyond comparison
to those you just beat.

149
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,800
Humph. Aren't titles useless
when it comes to fighting?

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,320
The stronger one wins. That's all.

151
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,580
Igarappa!

152
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,250
Let's go, Miss Wednesday!

153
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,340
Okay, Mr. 9!

154
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,570
Come, Karoo!

155
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,760
I didn't say "give me your hand"!
Come over here!

156
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,770
Now, show him your quick speed
that leaves leopards in the dust!

157
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,200
Who said "sit"?!

158
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,230
What the hell is that?

159
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,110
Can you afford to let your guard down?

160
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,530
Follow my acrobatics, if you can!!

161
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,250
Hot-blooded...

162
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,660
...Bat of Guts!

163
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,780
These're metallic bats. Be careful
not to chip your blades on them.

164
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,250
What's the matter? Are you
so frightened you can't move?

165
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,600
What happened to your proud acrobatics?

166
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,470
If you wanna see it that bad,
watch carefully!

167
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,680
Ahh...

168
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,310
Don't they have anyone better?

169
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,570
Anyone better? That would be me!

170
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,030
Be prepared... Mr. Bushido!

171
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,560
Now, take in my allure
to your heart's content!!

172
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,090
Charming Perfume Dance!

173
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,840
Good boy...

174
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,530
I'll finish you off with...
Peacock Slasher!

175
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,330
Go, Karoo!

176
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,040
You went too far!

177
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,470
Fighting these guys is
starting to get embarrassing...

178
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,580
He escaped below using that hole.

179
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,220
That's useless...

180
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,740
Get a good taste of how
frightening I really am!

181
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,240
That shotgun of his is a pain...
How should I close the distance?

182
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Ka-boom!

183
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,480
How dare you beat me like that earlier?!

184
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,140
You won't get away with it!

185
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,210
You fell on your own!

186
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,760
Home Run Sneaky Bat!

187
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,520
I tied up one of your arms!

188
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,890
It's an iron chain...

189
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,850
You caught him.

190
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,280
Mr. 8, do it now!

191
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,320
I won't let you escape!

192
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,780
That's right. Don't move.

193
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,570
If you make a stupid move,

194
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,240
I'll have to take your
precious friend's life as well.

195
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:51,590
Good job, Miss Wednesday.
You can't escape or attack now.

196
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,550
That idiot! At least wake up
when you're being held hostage!

197
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,760
Prepare to open fire!

198
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,060
Preparations completed!

199
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
What?!

200
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,980
Igarappappa!

201
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,440
Is he a toy?!

202
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,160
Igarappappa! Igarappappa!

203
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
Luffy! Let me use your belly!

204
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,880
What?!

205
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,210
Okay! Done!

206
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,320
It's finally become a quiet, nice night.

207
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,640
Huh? Why am I outside?

208
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh, well. I'm sleepy. I'm gonna sleep.

209
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,520
I never thought that four agents
with numbers under 12 would lose!

210
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,710
But where are you
planning to escape to?!

211
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,010
In any case, we'll hide somewhere
until they leave this island and...

212
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,890
Ahh! The Unluckies!!

213
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,420
H-Hold on a sec!

214
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,820
We're not running away!
It's not that...

215
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,230
Please! Don't report to the boss!

216
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,240
Hold it!

217
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,670
This town is quite lively
despite how late it is.

218
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,100
Ha! What a boring job he gave us...

219
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
...sending us all the way
to the front lines...

220
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,910
Hm?

221
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,060
I can't fall in a place like this.
I've got an important mission...

222
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,770
How pitiful...

223
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,670
...losing against just one swordsman...

224
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,570
Hm?!

225
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,100
Mr. 5! Miss Valentine!

226
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,200
Are you guys kidding around? Huh?

227
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,170
After all, this is the difference
between our rank and yours, isn't it?

228
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,880
Did you come to laugh at us?

229
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,130
That, too, but...

230
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,340
Of course, we're here under our mission.

231
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,200
Thank goodness. If you help us,
that man is no match for us!

232
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,640
That's right. Please beat
that swordsman right away.

233
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,560
Huh? Enough with the bad jokes.

234
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,760
Us help you?

235
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,240
Did you really think that
we'd come all the way

236
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,750
to the end of the Grand Line for that?

237
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,040
What? Then what mission
did you come here for?

238
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,070
You really have no idea?

239
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,750
There're criminals here that
are big enough for the boss

240
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,540
to send us here to deal with.

241
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,830
These're the boss' words:
"They've found out my secrets."

242
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,510
Of course, I don't even know what
kind of secrets they are, but...

243
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,250
...our company's motto is "mystery."

244
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,860
No matter whose identity it is,
the rule is that you never nose around.

245
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,070
If someone finds out the boss' secrets,

246
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,080
that's, of course, a sin worthy of death.

247
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,250
So, when we very carefully
investigated who learned his secrets...

248
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh boy, we found out that a VIP

249
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,200
from a certain kingdom
sneaked into Baroque Works.

250
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,350
A certain kingdom? W-Wait a sec!

251
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,710
Although I'm wearing a crown,
I'm not a king or anything!

252
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,220
It's just my hobby!

253
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,830
We're not talking about you!

254
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,640
The sinners are those who're missing
from Alabasta Kingdom right now...

255
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,600
They know! It's all over!

256
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,950
Die! Igarappappa!

257
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,240
I won't let you lay
a finger on our princess!

258
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
On my name as Squad Captain
of Alabasta Kingdom Security!

259
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,110
Igaram!!

260
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,900
Igaram, the Squad Captain
of Alabasta Kingdom Security.

261
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,660
And its princess, Nefertari Vivi.

262
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,170
In the name of the Baroque Works'
boss, we'll eliminate you two.

263
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,260
This isn't good...

264
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,480
I left Luffy down there...

265
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,700
You've got me!

266
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,410
Ah, gentle song

267
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,800
Make it there for us

268
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:31,880
After a wave washed away
that little sand castle

269
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:40,740
You looked up at the passing
clouds with a sad smile

270
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,740
If you find the world is full of enemies,

271
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,400
I've got your back

272
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:00,790
Don't lose faith

273
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,700
You've got me!

274
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,350
Ah, my love

275
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,620
I'll hold you in my arms forever

276
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,020
You've got me!

277
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,480
Why do I have to help
Nami make money?!

278
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,110
--Zoro!!
--What's the matter, Luffy? Oh, you too?!

279
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,320
I'll beat up an ungrateful jerk like you!

280
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,070
What're you talking about?!

281
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,780
Shut up! I won't forgive you! Fight me!

282
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,410
Are you really serious?!

283
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

284
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,460
"All-Out Battle! Luffy vs. Zoro,
Mysterious Grand Duel!"

285
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,790
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
