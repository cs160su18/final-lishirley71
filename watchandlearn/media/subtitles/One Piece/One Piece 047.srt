2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,680
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,570
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,730
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,480
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,470
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,810
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,280
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,190
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,090
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,010
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,870
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,900
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,030
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,010
Thanks!

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,840
I flashily thought I was a goner there!

26
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,800
There's no need to thank me.

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,760
You're Buggy the Clown, right?

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,660
How do you know that?!

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,970
Who are you?

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,860
I'm looking for a certain man.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,960
What do you say?
Will you team up with me?

32
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,180
"The Wait is Over!
The Return of Captain Buggy!"

33
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,710
To where are we headed, Buggy?

34
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,240
What?! I smell like I farted?!

35
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,590
No!

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,540
F-First, we need to find my crew...

37
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,380
I wonder where they are now,
and what they're up to...

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,760
Gum-Gum... Bazooka!

39
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,610
Retreat for now, men!

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,560
Everyone! Run away on your own!

41
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,050
Wait for us!

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,490
Is everyone here?!

43
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,030
Are the people who got off
the ship with you all back?!

44
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,730
Yes!

45
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,100
--Yes.
--Yes.

46
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,000
Yep!

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,600
Captain Buggy isn't...
Captain Buggy isn't here!

48
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,250
Captain Buggy!

49
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,790
Who knows how long
it's been since then...

50
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,330
Or even where
Captain Buggy flew off to?

51
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,570
What's going to happen to us?

52
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,180
What's the future of the Buggy Pirates?

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,370
This was all because of that girl
thief named Nami or whatever!

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,120
Roronoa Zoro... I will take
your head by my own hand!

55
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,720
Zoro! Did you finally catch cold
after always sleeping on deck?

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,290
I've never gotten sick
before, only injured.

57
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,630
Come to think of it,
I've never had a headache myself...

58
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,610
Is someone out there talkin'
about me being a master swordsman?

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,600
Ah, I see. Wait!

60
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,160
Someone's talking about me!

61
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,950
Honestly!

62
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,780
Being a hottie is punishment!
Someone's always talking about you...

63
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,070
Whoa!

64
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,470
Captain Buggy!

65
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,970
I always felt he was a cold-hearted,
horrible captain when he was well,

66
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,060
but now I realize he was a bold
and open-hearted pirate-like pirate!

67
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,090
When I look back, we were allowed
to ravage to our hearts' content

68
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,180
only because we had
Captain Buggy's backing!

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,180
Today, let's give the greatest and
flashiest funeral for Captain Buggy!

70
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,590
Captain... Rest in peace!

71
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,040
Please leave the rest
to me, Acrobat Cabaji,

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,450
the Buggy Pirates' Number Two
and Chief of Staff!

73
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,630
I promise to rebuild the Buggy Pirates!

74
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,060
Hold it!

75
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,440
Cabaji!

76
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,380
W-What?!

77
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,620
It's only natural for Captain
Buggy's successor to be me,

78
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,020
Beast Tamer Mohji-sama,
the vice-captain!

79
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,870
I'm the captain!

80
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,990
You can stay vice-captain
for the rest of your life!

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
Hey, guys!

82
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,790
We're gonna decide who gets to
be captain by seeing who's stronger!

83
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,480
Fine by me!

84
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,390
Mohji! Mohji! Mohji!

85
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,060
Cabaji! Cabaji! Cabaji!

86
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,030
Mohji! Mohji!

87
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,830
Cabaji! Cabaji!

88
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,840
Mohji! Mohji!

89
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,770
Cabaji! Cabaji!

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,040
Acrobat Technique: Monkey Showman!

91
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,250
Secret Technique:
Candid Camera Police Trio!

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,270
Murder at the Open-Air Steam Bath!

93
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,170
Die...

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,470
Mohji!

95
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,240
That's what you think!

96
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,620
Looks like I'll just have to fight
you until your body falls apart!

97
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah. A man-to-man fight.
I'll take you down with these two fists!

98
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,680
Mohji! Mohji!

99
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,710
Cabaji! Cabaji!

100
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,520
Mohji! Mohji!

101
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,750
Cabaji! Cabaji!

102
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,910
Yeah! You got 'im!

103
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,810
Ooh! So close!

104
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,700
Damn you... J-Just give up already...

105
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,110
N-No, you give up already...

106
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,850
I'm going to be captain!

107
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,680
Shut up!

108
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,550
Yes! Our Captain Richie!

109
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,810
Captain Richie!

110
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,310
Captain Richie! Captain Richie!
Our great captain!

111
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,930
With Captain Buggy now gone,
the most worthy of us to be captain

112
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,800
is Captain Richie!

113
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,170
Captain Richie! Our great captain!

114
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,720
Captain Richie! Captain Richie!
Our great captain!

115
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:48,600
Captain Richie! Captain Richie!
Our great captain!...

116
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,080
Who are you people?!

117
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,170
Who gave you permission
to come onto this island?!

118
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,660
You do realize this island belongs
to us, the Bear Claw Tribe, right?!

119
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,310
Captain!

120
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,080
Oh? So you're these guys' captain, huh?

121
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,770
Amusing! Are you picking a fight?!

122
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,770
W-We surrender...

123
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,080
Hey! Hey!

124
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,870
What is it?

125
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,660
You don't need to shout so loud;
I can hear you just fine.

126
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,580
Did you find something good?

127
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah! That's my...

128
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,850
...super flashy
Buggy Pirates pirate ship!

129
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,430
What's with this big grave?!

130
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,390
W-What?! I have a big nose?!

131
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,390
Who're you calling Big Nose?!
Eh?! Eh?! Are you talking about me?!

132
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,220
I said grave! Grave!

133
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,610
Red?! Red, you say?!

134
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,820
You're saying I have a big, red nose?!

135
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,400
What? My grave?!

136
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,320
Took you long enough.

137
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,250
But who did this?! This is morbid!

138
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,780
Not to mention this is
an old wanted poster...

139
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,250
Oh? There's someone
on the ground there...

140
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,540
Wha?!

141
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,050
Mohji! Cabaji!
What happened to you guys?!

142
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,010
C-Captain Buggy...

143
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,970
I-It's so good to see you...

144
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,890
I'm so glad you're all right!

145
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,330
I thought we'd never see you again!

146
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,940
I'm so happy, too!

147
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,530
But what on earth happened here?

148
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,220
Who did this to you?!

149
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,820
Eh? We suddenly got
punched out of the blue, so...

150
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,250
Embarrassingly enough,
we can't remember a thing...

151
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,030
The Bear Claw Tribe did this.

152
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,970
Bear Claw Tribe?!

153
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,790
Yeah. If you're going to
save them, you'd better hurry.

154
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,010
Bear Claw tribesmen are famous
for being food connoisseurs.

155
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,010
The captain says that lions taste bad!

156
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,800
We taste bad, too!

157
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,590
I won't be very tasty at all!

158
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,170
This guy tastes way better than me!

159
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,120
Lies! Lies! He tastes much better!

160
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,220
I'm too boney! I got nothing to eat!

161
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,120
Don't worry!

162
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,830
We're the Bear Claw Tribe!
We're iron chefs!

163
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,640
Some wine and spices
will take your smell away!

164
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,430
What do we do with this food?

165
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,910
What are they?

166
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,110
I've never seen such
strange ingredients before.

167
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
Do we boil it with them?

168
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,910
I just hope it doesn't
give me stomach trouble...

169
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,360
Chop-Chop-Chop...

170
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,870
...Chop-Chop-Chop-Chop...

171
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,070
Is that...?!

172
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,150
Chop-Chop-Chop-Chop
Chop-Chop-Chop...

173
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,620
Flashily reassemble!

174
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,930
I'm back!

175
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,990
--Captain Buggy!
--What?!

176
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,780
Sorry I took so long, men!

177
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,640
Liven things up with
a super flashy Buggy Ball!

178
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,780
Richie!

179
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,170
Acrobat Technique:
Murder at the Steam Bath!

180
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,440
Let the beast-taming show begin!

181
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,250
Do you really think you can
hit me, Buggy the Clown-sama?!

182
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,040
I hafta thank you all for
everything you did to my men!

183
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,700
Here I flashily come!

184
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,240
Chop-Chop Kick!

185
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,560
Chop-Chop Punch!

186
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,060
Die flashily!

187
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,820
Chop-Chop Rice Cracker!

188
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,330
Chop-Chop Festival!

189
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,080
Chop-Chop Punch!

190
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,040
Chop-Chop Carnival!

191
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,700
H-He's doing this all for us!

192
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,040
That's our captain!

193
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,610
Captain Buggy!

194
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,850
I'm so glad you're all right!

195
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,810
I've greatly pained you all,
my adorable underlings!

196
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,770
Our pain is nothing at all!

197
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,730
Who're you calling a weird creature?!

198
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:30,080
All the hardships you had were
because of that damn Straw Hat!

199
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,810
Incidentally, who might this
pretty young woman be?

200
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,300
Don't forget "really cute"!

201
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,150
Y-Yes. I had been
wondering about that myself...

202
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,820
This nice woman saved
my life! Her name is...

203
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,880
U-Uhh...

204
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,560
Umm, I'm sorry.
What was your name again?

205
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,030
Everyone! The Buggy
Pirates are back in action!

206
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,110
Captain! What is our first goal now?!

207
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,260
The head of Monkey D. Luffy!

208
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,130
Hey. I think I see an island.

209
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,250
Eh? Really?!

210
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,240
What island is that?!

211
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,180
I just told you the other day!

212
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,030
Huh?

213
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,960
So that's the island where Loguetown is!

214
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,990
It's a pretty big town, right?

215
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah, that's what I hear!

216
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,810
Then it sounds like there might
be a market with fresh ingredients.

217
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,010
I'm hittin' up the weapon stores.

218
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,500
Being stuck with one sword doesn't
suit a Three Sword-Style user.

219
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,200
In that case, I guess I'll
check out some equipment shops!

220
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:24,240
That island is where Gold Roger
was born and then executed, right?

221
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,060
Wow, you actually remember!

222
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,850
The town where the
King of the Pirates died...

223
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,580
Also known as the city of
the beginning and end...

224
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,830
My overflowing feelings don't connect

225
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,670
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

226
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,590
I'll set off by myself,

227
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,550
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

228
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,270
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

229
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,370
Why is it so hot?

230
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:55,370
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

231
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,670
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

232
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,510
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

233
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

234
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,610
With you, I can run there

235
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,710
So this is the city where Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates, died!

236
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,310
This place is filled with great
ingredients and beautiful girls!

237
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,810
Think they got any bargain sales?!

238
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,050
What are you, a housewife?

239
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,040
Climbing the execution platform
and seeing the scenery comes first!

240
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,640
I want some swords, but...

241
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,030
Do you have money?

242
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,350
I can lend you some at 300% interest!

243
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,760
On the next episode of One Piece!

244
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,880
"The Town of the Beginning and End;
Landfall at Loguetown"

245
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
