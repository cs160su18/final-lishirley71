00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,970
Raigo!

18
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,590
He eradicated Angel Island...

19
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,420
Old diamond-head's ancestor...

20
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,050
He wasn't lying.

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,150
So I have to let the old guy
and the others below know...

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,310
...that the city of gold was in the sky!

23
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,940
I can't let Eneru take it!

24
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm sure the huge bell can
be heard from anywhere...

25
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,150
...so that's why I'm going to ring the gold bell!

26
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,210
"Knock Over Giant Jack!
Last Hope For Escape"

27
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,870
Even Heaven's Gate... was blown
away in the blink of an eye.

28
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,820
To think that Angel Island is gone...
What're we supposed to do now?

29
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,460
In any case, we have to escape
to the Blue Sea via Cloud End!

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,750
We have no other choice!

31
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,860
But there're still many people
left in the White-White Sea!

32
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,250
What can we do?!

33
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,450
How can we bring those ships down to
the White Sea without the Milky Roads?!

34
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,870
Then, are we giving up on them?!

35
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,050
Even this area will be like that before long.

36
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,760
The White-White Sea is...

37
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,350
Skypiea is fading away...

38
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,610
"God"

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,170
"God"

40
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,040
So this is it...

41
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,280
Splendid!!

42
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,110
So this is the grand belfry that was the
pride of the legendary city, Shandora!

43
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,530
Amazing! This is a perfect fit
for me, the one who is God!

44
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,400
The bell that proclaimed the start
of this land's 400-year-old conflict...

45
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
But to think that they carried on with
this pointless battle for so many years...

46
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,620
...only to see everything disappear...

47
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,250
Luffy, you can't catch up with him any longer!

48
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,780
Eneru's ship is not moving from that place...

49
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,600
Luffy... Eneru must've taken
the golden bell by now.

50
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,630
No matter how hard you stretch
your arms, you can't reach up there.

51
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,520
If he took it, then I'll take it back!!

52
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,090
Let me use this!

53
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,690
Eneru's ship is too far from the top
of this vine. What should we do?!

54
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,750
How can we get there?

55
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone...

56
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,860
No one can be allowed to escape now!

57
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,960
Including the several unmoving
voices directly below you!

58
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,040
That's right!

59
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,090
They haven't escaped yet...
Everyone's still down there!

60
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,110
Watch out! Something's falling again!

61
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,650
What's that?

62
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,100
Everyone, heads down!

63
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,250
A leaf...

64
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,230
Oh? There's something written on it.

65
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,930
It's a message! From Luffy and Nami!

66
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,200
What does it say?!

67
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,980
"Cut down this huge vine
so it falls towards the west."

68
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,560
What?!

69
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,480
Um, what'll happen... if we do that?

70
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,010
Hey, where's west?

71
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,910
A-Are we really gonna do it?!

72
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,730
So... where's west?

73
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,080
It's the direction where Eneru's ship is.

74
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,810
I've accomplished all my objectives.

75
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,110
All that's left now is...

76
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,600
...to destroy this land together with
the cumuloregalis clouds using Raigo,

77
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,620
and set off for the Endless Vearth.

78
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,300
Now that the time has come,
I almost hate to go.

79
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,750
Eneru!!

80
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,430
Damn him!

81
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,090
That is way bigger than the one from earlier!

82
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,260
We... won't be able to escape
from this land... any longer!

83
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,400
Farewell, Skypiea.

84
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,860
It's bigger than the last one! That bastard!

85
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,380
Yeah. Now that he's got the golden bell,

86
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,840
he no longer has any business with this land.

87
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,880
He's easy to figure out.

88
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,630
I'm not gonna let him have his way!

89
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,510
Nami, weren't you going to escape?

90
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
You expect me to leave now?

91
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,050
You want to ring it, right? That golden bell?

92
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,770
Yeah! I'm gonna ring it!

93
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,980
Honestly... you can't even control the waver.

94
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,770
Even if I just leave you here,
you'll keep trying to jump anyway,

95
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,990
so I'll give you a ride and shoot you up there.

96
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,490
But...

97
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,960
...you have to guarantee my life!

98
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,870
Okay, got it! Thanks!

99
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,120
We're just gonna get one chance, one moment!

100
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,020
I hope they got my message okay.

101
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,620
They're gonna jump to the ship
by crossing the falling vine?!

102
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,870
What else could it mean?

103
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,700
That's crazy...

104
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,460
Then you go up there and stop them.

105
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,760
As if he could be stopped!!

106
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,720
In any case, reckless or not, we've
got no choice but to let him do this!

107
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,510
Wh-What the...?!

108
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,950
Long-nose!

109
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,900
Ah, got 'im!

110
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,080
If we stay here, we'll be
pushed off to the ruins below.

111
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,730
Everyone, get away from the vine for now!

112
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,580
Escape to solid ground!

113
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,420
Anyhow, I'm gonna do it! I need to cut
the vine down towards the ship, right?!

114
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,190
What?! But...!

115
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,850
The only ones on this sky
island who can reach Eneru

116
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,380
before that thing is dropped...

117
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,280
Hey, Zoro!

118
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,030
...are those two!!

119
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,560
You just don't know when to give up.

120
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,450
It's too late to struggle or escape now.

121
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,810
You still don't get it?

122
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,930
When you entered the survival game,
your fate was already decided.

123
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,140
I-I-Is he okay?!

124
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,850
We're counting on you! You're the
only one who can cut that thing down!

125
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,030
Damn you, making all these holes!

126
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,920
Alright!! He cut it!!

127
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,810
Ahhh! Zoro!!

128
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,420
You worms!

129
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,300
You bastard!!

130
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,180
B-B-But he did it! He cut it!!

131
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,410
Oh, no... Look!

132
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,960
It's not coming down...
even though it was cut...

133
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,760
What a strong vine!
Is that thing really a plant?!

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,730
How pathetic... This is what you
outsiders get for butting in.

135
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,970
Wyper! Don't be reckless!

136
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,120
Quiet!

137
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,830
It is important that we, the inheritors
of Calgara's wishes, ring that bell!

138
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,860
What does this have to do
with that Straw Hat?!

139
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,740
Leave him be, Robin! He can't stop us
when he's seriously injured like that.

140
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,940
Our priority now is knocking over that vine!

141
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,750
Luffy and Nami are waiting up there!

142
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,570
In any case, Zoro cut half of the stem.

143
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,240
The whole thing should be tilting by now.

144
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,630
By hitting it with my
Dance of Exploding Stars...

145
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,090
...it'll be leveled with a loud scream!

146
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,600
As expected, I am the last line
of defense of this pirate group!

147
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,580
Robin, take care of those who have fallen!

148
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,760
They look like a kashiwa-mochi cake.

149
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,070
Move out!

150
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,850
Four hundred years ago, an explorer
told a lie that he saw a city of gold.

151
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,380
Although people laughed at him,
his descendants believed his words

152
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,430
and are still searching for this
city of gold in the Blue Sea.

153
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,990
If we ring the golden bell, we can let
them know the city of gold is in the sky.

154
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,070
That's what that straw hat boy is thinking.

155
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,670
Exploding Star!

156
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,800
That's a wonderful reason,
isn't it? It has romanticism.

157
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,450
Even in a situation like this...

158
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,610
...going so far as to lose
his chance to escape...

159
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,620
He's nuts!

160
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,650
Exploding Star! Exploding Star Star!!

161
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,500
Usopp Rubber Band! Rolling
Exploding Star! Exploding Star!!

162
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,080
What... is the name of
this explorer's descendant?

163
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,260
Montblanc Cricket...

164
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:24,070
Then... is the name... of his ancestor
from 400 years ago Noland?

165
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,100
What?

166
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,620
Wyper?

167
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,170
What're you doing all of a sudden, Wyper?!

168
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,730
Is this a miracle...

169
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,950
...Great Warrior Calgara?!

170
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
Come on, Nola! We'll ring the bell again today

171
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,590
so that the sound reaches
to the end of the sky!

172
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,770
Let's send the sound that you love to Noland!

173
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,660
What the...?!

174
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,860
What was that?

175
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,440
But... to think that this vine wasn't
affected by that shock at all...

176
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,690
Dammit! This time'll be Triple Explo...

177
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,670
Out of my way!

178
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,450
Calgara...

179
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,310
They say that the
descendants of your best friend

180
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,790
are still waiting for...
the ring of the golden bell!

181
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,550
What patience those guys have!

182
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,980
Reject!!

183
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,770
Ugh! What the heck was that?!

184
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,780
Wyper!!

185
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,910
How foolish... A Reject Dial...

186
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,220
Break! Giant Jack!!

187
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,640
It's coming down!!

188
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,760
Here goes! Get on, Luffy!

189
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,640
Run it at full power!

190
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,650
To be honest, I've never tried the
maximum power of this Jet Dial

191
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,800
because it's too strong for me to control.

192
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,330
Then use it!

193
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,530
Okay!

194
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,950
Here we go, Luffy!!

195
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,510
Yeah!!

196
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,250
It's coming down!

197
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,900
Look!

198
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,650
What on earth is going on?!

199
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,890
We're counting on you two! Luffy! Nami!

200
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,360
If the sky island disappears now,
we won't be able to ring the golden bell!

201
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,180
You'll ring it, right?! You'll let
old-timer Cricket hear it, right?!

202
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,730
Jump to where Eneru is!

203
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,200
Go!! Everything depends on you two!!

204
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,080
Go!!

205
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,300
My, my... Why can't you quietly
wait for the completion of Raigo?

206
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,780
How impatient they are...

207
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,300
I have no choice, then.

208
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,360
Something's coming!

209
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,160
Don't slow down! I'll repel those things!

210
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,490
It's missing us! You're a bad shot!

211
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,960
It's insolent of you to try and come to me!
You need to be taught a lesson!

212
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,060
Mamaragan!

213
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,220
That bastard! He's trying to
sink the vine from the base!

214
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,110
Do something, Nami!

215
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,310
I can't do anything! We're already climbing up!

216
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,730
If this vine loses its foundation, we'll no
longer be able to come up this high!

217
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,450
We won't be able to get close to Eneru!

218
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,270
Upper Yard is being pummeled with attacks!

219
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,530
Luffy! Nami!

220
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,580
Even if the lightning doesn't work on you,

221
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,400
"God"

222
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,400
it doesn't mean anything
unless you can reach here!

223
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:56,280
Fall down below and wait for the
completion of Raigo, rubber man!

224
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

225
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

226
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

227
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

228
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

229
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

230
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

231
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

232
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,240
Listen, Luffy, make sure
you end it this time!

233
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,090
Disappear with the land!

234
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,550
No matter how much you destroy,the
land won't be beaten!

235
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,880
What God wouldn't save anything at all?!

236
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,090
I'm gonna ring the bell no matter what!!

237
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,780
Let us hear the singing voice of the island.

238
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,280
On the next episode of One Piece!

239
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,620
"Miracle on God's Land! The
Love Song That Reached the Angels"

240
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,770
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
