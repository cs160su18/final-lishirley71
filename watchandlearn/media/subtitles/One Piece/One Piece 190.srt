00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,770
Did you know there's an awesome
treasure at the end of this sea?!

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,170
And whoever gets it can be King
of the Pirates! Isn't that exciting?!

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,930
Unheard-of adventures are waiting!

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:53,320
Bon voyage! Let that shred of courage grow

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,920
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,840
The horizons everyone
dreamed of were separate at first

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,000
but now they can be seen
through a single telescope

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,130
A bitter compass of destiny
is leading your heart astray

10
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,260
so turn the wheel in the other direction!

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
Bon voyage!

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,220
Toss aside your bonds and your past

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,400
We can surely smile despite that

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,990
Tears shed trying to achieve
your dreams aren't for naught

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,470
Precious in my life

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,960
I caught a glimpse of
the tail end to the future

17
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,020
Eneru's attacks mercilessly rained
down on all of Skypiea.

18
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,760
Everything is an eyesore!

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,020
The people, the trees, the land!
Return to where you belong!

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,530
Let everything rain into the Blue Sea!

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,030
Hurry!

22
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,380
Angel Island won't last much longer!

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,240
There are no safe havens left on this island!

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,650
Meanwhile, Robin and Usopp's
group was still beneath Giant Jack.

25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,230
He's far above now.

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,640
It's only a matter of time until
his ship reaches the top of the vine.

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,620
What is it Eneru wants there?

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,790
A gold bell at the top.

29
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,850
A bell...

30
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,200
I have no need for good
old God's Shrine either!

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,620
Nor for the city of Shandora below it!

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
There is but one thing left
in this land that I want!

33
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,640
The golden grand belfry!

34
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,600
And Luffy, in an attempt to
catch Eneru, rushed up Giant Jack.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Nami! Be all right!

36
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,530
And I won't let you have
the golden bell, Eneru!

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,630
"Angel Island Obliterated!
The Horror of the Raigo's Advent!!"

38
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,180
A gold bell?

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,930
Is that what you said?!

40
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,010
Wyper...

41
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,610
Yes...

42
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,400
W-What're you guys talking about?!

43
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,380
You also spoke of the bell before
being hit by Eneru's electric attack.

44
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,870
So he's going after it?

45
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,090
Where exactly is it?!

46
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,290
Hey! Wait! This is no time for that!
You saw that thunderbolt!

47
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,880
We're gonna die if we don't get outta here!

48
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,630
Somewhere near the top of this giant vine...

49
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,170
How?! How do you know that?!

50
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,960
Hey! We promised we'd wait
for Nami back on our ship!

51
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,380
She's gonna be back with Luffy any time now!

52
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,220
He's right, Wyper!

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,140
The ruins of Shandora in the layer below us...

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,220
This vine pierces right through
the very center of the city.

55
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,040
Oh, geez! Look!

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,030
I dunno if it's ruins or what,
but it's been blasted to pieces!

57
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,270
We could be next, you know!

58
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,920
A map I found in the ruins
indicated that the grand belfry

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,000
that held the golden bell was
located in the city's center.

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,010
A-Are you completely ignoring me?

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,820
In other words, the shock from
being thrust upward by the vine

62
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,910
might have thrown the bell
even further skyward.

63
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,370
It's directly above here?!

64
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,240
The singing voice of the island...

65
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,410
Hey!

66
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,960
The city of gold has a huge bell, right?

67
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,470
Now, then. I'm above Giant Jack.

68
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,490
I doubt anyone would come
searching for something

69
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,570
in these skies above God's Shrine.

70
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,040
Even after 400 years...

71
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,870
Now, then. Where is the golden bell...?

72
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,880
What is this place?!

73
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,330
Him...

74
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,530
I'm astonished he made it here
with that weight attached.

75
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,880
There you are!

76
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,410
Wait right there! Eneru!

77
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,800
Such a pest.

78
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,750
Wyper! What are you planning to do?!

79
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,190
Don't tell me you're gonna climb the vine?!

80
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,210
Everyone! Get away from the vine!

81
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,280
Something's falling!

82
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,840
The tip of the vine?! What happened above?!

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,280
Hey, now! Don't tell me
Luffy and Nami fell with it?!

84
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,580
Wyper!

85
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,970
No! You can't in your condition!
You're all beat up!

86
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,090
And even if you do climb up, there's
no way to reach Eneru in the sky!

87
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,840
It's...

88
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,310
It's directly above!

89
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,030
The bell that Great Warrior Calgara sought!

90
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,540
Calgara?

91
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,820
Yes.

92
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,580
That's what our true goal is!

93
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,780
Eneru! I refuse to let you have it!

94
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,640
How do you intend to
climb up here in that state?

95
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,520
D-Damn you!

96
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:29,350
Stay there for a while. I'll show
you something interesting.

97
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,140
Huh?

98
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,880
Oh, right! I gotta figure
something out while he's gone!

99
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,170
That's my only choice!

100
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,830
Gum-Gum...

101
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,090
...Yo-Yo!

102
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,420
What is he doing?!

103
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,230
All right! I'm back on track!

104
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,170
Now's my chance to get on board!

105
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Luffy! I finally caught up to you!

106
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
Eh? Nami! What're you doing here?!

107
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,300
I came to get you!

108
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,050
Sanji-kun and Usopp saved me,
so I was down below!

109
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,880
Really?! You were?! That's great!

110
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,850
But more importantly...

111
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,380
Wait!

112
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,690
What's that?!

113
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,650
The thunderclouds... are changing shape!

114
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,640
The sky!

115
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,140
Help!

116
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,190
This is bad! Save us!

117
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,350
The sky's pitch dark!

118
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,320
What's happening?!

119
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,830
Mom!

120
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,120
Into the ocean! Quickly!

121
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,530
There's a giant ball floating in the sky!

122
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,170
That thing's bad news...

123
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,070
That's a thundercloud
wrapped in a spherical shroud...

124
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,870
...and it's packed with intense currents
and internal electric discharges!

125
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,820
It's directly above Angel Island!

126
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,850
The thunderclouds turned spherical...

127
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,280
T-This is a nightmare! This isn't
something you see in real life!

128
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,590
What more is he planning to unleash?!

129
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,730
Hurry! Into the ocean!

130
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,290
Wait!

131
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,820
Now you will learn that the heavens are mine!

132
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:06,120
With the Maxim and my power,I
can accomplish such acts of God!

133
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,540
Look at that!

134
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,430
It's falling onto Angel Island!

135
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,130
It's too late!

136
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,110
We're not going to make it!

137
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,570
Run! Hurry!

138
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,270
I'm scared!

139
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,740
Raigo.

140
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,860
No, this can't be!

141
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,060
Did the White Berets manage to escape?

142
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,500
The White Berets saved us...

143
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,090
The island we were born on and our
hometown are completely gone!

144
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,230
Even the Sea Clouds were obliterated!

145
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,220
What a wonderful sight!

146
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,550
This is how the sky should be!

147
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,730
W-What was that explosion?!

148
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,390
And the thunderbolts are still raining down?!

149
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,700
I don't get the feeling
I'll be leaving alive now!

150
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,830
He eradicated Angel Island...

151
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,320
How can you be so ruthless, Eneru?!

152
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,380
What loud rumbling...

153
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,250
We have to wait. We have to
take them back to the Blue Sea!

154
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,890
Luffy! Get on, so we can go back down!

155
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,870
Everyone's headed for our ship!
We gotta get going, too!

156
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,520
I can't.

157
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,000
You can't? Why not?!
What're you talking about?!

158
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,340
Even if I don't have to save you now...

159
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,140
...I still have unfinished business here!

160
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,280
Unfinished business? What could
you possibly have left to do here?!

161
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,800
Are you trying to get back
at Eneru or something?!

162
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,220
There's a gold bell up above!

163
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:10,070
Gold? Your life is more important,
you know! Just look!

164
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,500
Even if lightning doesn't hurt you,

165
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,130
he has the power to destroy
everything in other ways!

166
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,050
If it's gold you want, then look!
You have some on your arm!

167
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,910
Forget about some gold bell! You'll be killed!

168
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,750
I won't die...

169
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,950
Will you quit it, already?! You--

170
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,010
You saw it yourself!

171
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,750
Saw what?

172
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,120
The city of gold... it existed!

173
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,650
It wasn't a lie.

174
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,770
Old diamond-head's ancestor...

175
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,710
If it exists, that's fine. If not, that's fine, too.

176
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,280
I'm not really out to prove
his innocence or anything.

177
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,790
This is a duel with the man
who screwed up my life.

178
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,790
He wasn't lying.

179
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,680
So I have to let the old guy
and the others below know...

180
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,890
...that the city of gold was in the sky!

181
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,340
If I ring the bell...
they should be able to hear it!

182
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,090
Otherwise, they'll keep on searching
the ocean floor until they die!

183
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,130
Luffy...

184
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,700
I can't let Eneru take it!

185
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,710
I'm sure the huge bell can
be heard from anywhere...

186
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,860
...so that's why I'm going to ring the gold bell!

187
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,050
Hey! The City of Gold has a huge bell, right?

188
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,690
Yes, Noland's logbook did mention it had one.

189
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,940
Why do you ask?

190
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,440
Why do you ask?

191
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,120
I thought up a good idea!

192
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,270
What? What is it?!

193
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,930
If we rang that huge bell,

194
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,270
do you think old diamond-head
and the monkeys below would hear it?

195
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
They'd hear it, right?

196
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,010
When he says he's gonna
do something, he means it.

197
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,130
Then, he's...

198
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,750
He did say that. But given the situation...

199
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,920
He's going to ring the bell, you say?!

200
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,400
Yeah. Even if Nami tries to
bring him back, he won't come.

201
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,220
Because he's after the same thing Eneru is.

202
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,710
I did it!

203
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,050
Who gave you permission to board this ship?

204
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,640
Eneru!

205
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,590
Luffy!

206
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,180
See! I told you it was a bad idea!

207
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,230
Damn him!

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,910
Well? Did you see the silly
little island vanish from the sky?!

209
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,180
Girl. I assume you're not
going to try and sweet-talk me

210
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,670
by asking me to take you
to Endless Vearth again...

211
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,930
Hell, no!

212
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,920
Once I have what I want,

213
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,160
I will destroy all of Skypiea
with this next Raigo!

214
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,430
No one can be allowed to escape now!

215
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,440
Including the several unmoving
voices directly below you!

216
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
Directly below?!

217
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,580
I'm going to eradicate this land
that is out of place in the sky

218
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,020
and change everything
back to how it should be!

219
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,280
That is my duty as God!

220
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,110
I won't let you...

221
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,150
...have your way!

222
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,830
Farewell, rubber man!

223
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,020
Look on wistfully and
wait until the end arrives!

224
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,920
Luffy!

225
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,510
Luffy!

226
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,570
No one can stop me now.

227
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,470
Damn it!

228
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,710
Listen! We will send you
into the sky, without fail!

229
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,280
Luffy...

230
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,680
I...

231
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,430
...will ring that bell!

232
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,710
If you're feeling lonely, talk to me

233
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,920
You gaze at the heavens
as you wander about

234
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,540
Just like the moon,
you keep your gaze constant

235
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:39,920
And your deep reflection wanes
as you slowly disappear

236
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:53,450
Stay as you are, let those words guide you

237
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:07,170
Dream, you travelers who spend
countless nights drifting

238
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,700
Even if you may not be able to go back

239
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,050
you will surely start moving forward again

240
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,130
Did you see the power of the Raigo?!

241
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,710
Next up are the cumuloregalis
clouds themselves!

242
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,940
Isn't there anything we can do?!

243
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,060
It's important that we, the inheritors
of Calgara's wishes, ring that bell!

244
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,570
Knock over this vine?! Am I our
last line of defense after all?!

245
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,250
Luffy! Guarantee me I'll survive!

246
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,450
On the next episode of One Piece!

247
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,710
"Knock Over Giant Jack!
Last Hope for Escape"

248
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
