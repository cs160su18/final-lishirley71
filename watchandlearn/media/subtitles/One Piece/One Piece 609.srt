2
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,680
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,180
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,970
a boy whose body turned to rubber

9
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,340
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

10
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

11
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,530
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

12
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,940
After surviving a fierce battle,

13
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,420
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

14
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,940
the harshest sea ruled by the Four Emperors.

15
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,360
They landed on Punk Hazard;

16
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,980
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

17
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,800
After learning about Caesar's motive,

18
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,830
they are on the move to save the children,

19
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,330
kidnap Caesar, and escape from the island--

20
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,790
all while trying to escape Shinokuni.

21
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,020
I have treated him
as my young brother

22
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,420
and watched closely
over him as he grew up.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,590
What a shame.

24
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,800
I understand.

25
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,530
I know it's hard for you, Vergo,

26
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,450
but I need you to take care of Law there.

27
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,970
I wanna make him wish
that he was never born.

28
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,150
So kill him in a horrific way.

29
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,860
"Luffy Dies from Exposure?!
The Spine-chilling Snow Woman Monet!"

30
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,310
D BUILDING - THE "SAD" MANUFACTURING ROOM

31
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,570
I feel like my hand has been bitten

32
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,840
by my own dog.

33
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,720
Law.

34
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,460
This is too much -

35
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,050
even for a mischievous child.

36
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,950
You were too smart
for your own good.

37
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,120
People like you...

38
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,990
...tend to die young.

39
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,410
It'd be easiest for me to kill
you by crushing your heart

40
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,940
but I'm not gonna do that.

41
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,980
I'll torment you slowly as I please

42
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,310
and warp your smart-ass face...

43
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,380
...with fear.

44
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,850
Like that time!

45
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,320
Stand up, Law.

46
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,080
It's too soon to die.

47
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,420
C BUILDING 4TH FLOOR - CAESAR'S RESEARCH ROOM

48
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,430
Damn! What does she want?!

49
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,840
Hey, bird woman!

50
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,250
Come on out!

51
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,100
I won't let you go after the Master.

52
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,020
This thing again! But it's nothing!

53
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,940
Gum-Gum...

54
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,800
...Jet Pistol!

55
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,220
Another wall?!

56
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,830
What's going on?

57
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,370
Gum-Gum...

58
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,460
...Jet Gatling!

59
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,150
What?!

60
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,520
What are these walls?!

61
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,070
Hey, bird woman!

62
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,860
What are you doing?!

63
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,040
Ten-layer Kamakura!

64
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,320
There are ten layers to this Kamakura.

65
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,780
It's not easy to break the snow walls

66
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,790
if they're layered one after another.

67
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,940
What? Are you trying to buy time?!

68
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,230
I can break them all quickly...

69
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,630
I bet so.

70
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,540
I think you can break this Kamakura.

71
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,200
If you think so, stop wasting my time!

72
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,010
Don't get so hot!

73
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,640
I don't think I'm gonna lose you at all!

74
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,570
I'm not surprised.

75
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,310
I don't think I will win
if I fight you.

76
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,600
However,

77
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,200
the strongest isn't always
the winner in a fight.

78
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,590
It's cold.

79
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,050
She's like a block of ice.

80
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,980
Let go of me!

81
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,580
You can't push me away.

82
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,720
You're now in my embrace

83
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
and your power is diminished.

84
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,370
You will lose all of
your physical strength

85
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,140
to my cold body in no time.

86
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,460
And eventually,

87
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,280
your heart will freeze

88
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,110
and you will

89
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,860
die in your sleep.

90
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,380
Look.

91
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,120
It's snowing heavily around you.

92
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,850
You feel very tired, don't you?

93
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,400
That's it.

94
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,620
It's okay.

95
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,990
Just let it be.

96
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,340
It feels good, doesn't it?

97
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,190
Close your eyes slowly.

98
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,200
Now, relax.

99
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,340
Good night.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,430
Get a grip!

101
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,980
This is just the beginning
of the New World!

102
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,380
Jet Spear!

103
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,280
The floor!

104
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,250
What tremendous hidden strength he has.

105
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,270
But falling through here

106
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,770
will land him in the slide to the
garbage dump deep underground.

107
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,550
He'll never be able to come
back up unless he can fly.

108
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,440
I didn't expect him to
sabotage himself like that.

109
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,320
Goodbye!

110
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
B BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - NEAR THE BISCUIT ROOM

111
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,010
The candy!

112
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,560
Give us the candy!

113
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,930
You must never
eat that candy again.

114
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,440
Shut up! Get out of our way!

115
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,150
Don't you wanna go home?

116
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,360
I know it's hard
but you have to endure it.

117
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,700
I won't let you pass through here.

118
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,910
You can't go to the Biscuit Room!

119
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,050
Move!

120
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,140
You're in our way!

121
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,250
You bastard!

122
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,710
The candy!

123
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,580
Wait.

124
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,400
Let go of me!

125
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,580
Give me the candy!

126
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,170
The candy!

127
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,210
No!

128
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,090
Ouch! You're hurting me!

129
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,200
Oh, sorry!

130
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
I didn't mean to hurt you...

131
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,460
Don't get in our way,
you monster!

132
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,310
It's our candy!

133
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,700
Damn!

134
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,940
I can't stop them without hurting them!

135
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,080
Now is our chance!

136
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,570
Let's go to the Biscuit Room!

137
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,060
No!

138
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,110
Don't go that way!

139
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,670
Oh no!

140
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,160
The effect of the Rumble Ball
is about to wear off!

141
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,660
We can eat the candy soon!

142
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,090
The candy!

143
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,880
Run! To the Biscuit Room!

144
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,910
We can eat the candy!

145
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,260
Hey, kids, wait!

146
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,320
Oh no!

147
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,150
I can't move!

148
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,230
Damn!

149
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,340
Kids, no!

150
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,270
If you take more of the drug,

151
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,860
it will ruin your body!

152
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,160
Please, everybody!

153
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,570
Stop!

154
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,320
Please stop!

155
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,360
Don't eat the candy!

156
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,320
Damn! Dammit!

157
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,780
Damn! Damn!

158
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,370
I can't save them
because I have no power!

159
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,640
Chopper!

160
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,880
What's going on here?!

161
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,380
Nami!

162
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,100
Everybody!

163
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,550
Are you all right, Chopper-san?!

164
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,640
What's wrong with those kids?!

165
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,680
They've gotten more violent!

166
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,600
Momonosuke! Where are you?!

167
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,630
I'm glad that you're all here!

168
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,230
Tell us what's going on, Chopper!

169
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,120
Caesar is trying to turn them into giants

170
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,390
in order to make them demonic
soldiers, just as we thought.

171
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,130
I can't handle them alone anymore!

172
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,910
You guys have to stop them
as soon as possible!

173
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,580
The Biscuit Room is to the left!

174
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,270
The candies are there!

175
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,140
Mocha is the only child in her
right mind and she's helping me.

176
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,940
We were trying to stop the other children

177
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,350
but we couldn't!

178
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,860
She is protecting the candies
in the room all alone!

179
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,480
We're here at the Biscuit Room!

180
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,350
The candy!

181
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,060
Mocha is in danger!

182
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,820
Mil Fleurs

183
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,980
Gigantesco Mano!

184
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,800
Go forward while I hold them here.

185
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,990
Yeah, thanks!

186
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,700
Get out of our way!

187
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,920
They're not gonna be
stopped so easily!

188
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,340
They'll stop at nothing
when they're in that state!

189
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,500
Mocha is...

190
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,800
Mocha!

191
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,630
Give us the candy!

192
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,870
No, everybody!

193
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,200
I can't give it to you!

194
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,490
The candy!

195
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,980
It's evil candy!

196
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,660
The candy!

197
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,840
Pull yourself together!

198
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,040
We asked Chopper-chan and
the others to help us!

199
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Give it to me!

200
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
No!

201
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,670
If we don't listen to them,
we can't go home!

202
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,730
It's no use! Just run!

203
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,050
Run, Mocha!

204
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,430
Hey, wait! That's no fair!

205
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,600
Chase her!

206
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,410
Wait!

207
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,600
Are you gonna eat it all yourself?!

208
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm not gonna let them have it!

209
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,730
I wanna go home with everybody!

210
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,160
What's this?!

211
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,540
It's cold! I'm freezing!

212
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,000
The exit is sealed!

213
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,380
What should I do?!

214
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,650
You don't have to
worry about anything.

215
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,560
It's Monet-san!

216
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,180
Who is that woman?

217
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Oh, it's her!

218
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,270
She is the bird woman
that I told you about!

219
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,360
Monet-san, please help me!

220
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,100
Mocha, it's not nice
to keep it all to yourself.

221
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,240
You have to share
the candies with everyone.

222
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,460
What?!

223
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,990
Oh, she uses sorcery!

224
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,660
She's a Logia-type?!

225
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,710
So she's our enemy, huh?!

226
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,840
Monet-san, why?

227
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,840
B BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - AN EXAMINATION ROOM

228
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,860
Oh yeah, where did the boy go?

229
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,740
The boy?

230
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,440
Uh-huh.

231
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,870
He entered into the "secret room"
where no one is allowed

232
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,880
and transformed into a small dragon.

233
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,080
The boy named Momonosuke.

234
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,670
The brat who transformed into a dragon?

235
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,830
I mean, "the boy"!

236
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,250
How did you know
about that, young lady?

237
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,200
I was watching it secretly.

238
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,210
It happened in the "secret room"

239
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,300
so I didn't tell anyone.

240
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,970
But I got here on the same ship
with him so I've been worrying.

241
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh I see.

242
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,690
But he's doing okay.

243
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,030
This laboratory is big and...

244
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,660
...there are various treatment rooms

245
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,280
and he's just in a different room.

246
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,070
Hmm.

247
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,820
Is he eating something?

248
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,330
Why doesn't he eat anything?

249
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,520
No no, he's eating.

250
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,070
Don't worry.

251
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,880
He's fine.

252
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,930
Listen.

253
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,800
Don't tell anyone about him

254
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,130
and the "secret room." Okay?

255
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,010
Uh-huh.

256
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,630
I can't believe one of the
children knows about it.

257
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,600
We have to let the Master know.

258
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,830
I never thought

259
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,340
I'd come to this secret room myself.

260
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,090
But this is the only place I can pull it off.

261
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,850
It's all their fault!

262
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,350
It could've been a great show -
everything perfect and lovely,

263
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,430
and more befitting of the
world's greatest scientist!

264
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,570
But they screwed it up!

265
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,730
Straw Hat Luffy!

266
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,900
And his crew!

267
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,760
The Navy G-5!

268
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,030
Trafalgar Law!

269
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,060
I'll make them regret ruining my plan

270
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,330
even after they go to hell!

271
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,670
Bow down to my scientific prowess!

272
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,690
Are you guys frustrated because your
scheme is coming crashing down?

273
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,640
It is that important to you guys, isn't it?

274
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,140
This thing?!

275
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,700
Watch your mouth, you squirt!

276
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,670
Room!

277
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,590
Come back to me, my heart!

278
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,260
Counter Shock!

279
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,810
I have a message from Joker.

280
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,870
He said "What a shame."

281
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,540
It didn't work!

282
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,300
I was pretty sure that I could
take my heart back from Caesar.

283
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,130
But I didn't expect you here.

284
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,960
Vergo!

285
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,430
It's Vergo-san to you!

286
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,470
I'm in the middle of something.

287
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,050
Does it have to be now?

288
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,010
Vice Admiral Smoker.

289
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,140
I was going to silence
you anyway, though.

290
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,460
You better make your move.

291
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,650
It's not so pleasant to watch...

292
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,350
...a scumbag like you!

293
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,950
The pirate -

294
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,370
Vergo!

295
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,130
Smoker's rage explodes at the fact
that Vergo's betrayed his men,

296
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,490
and Vergo closes in on him
with overwhelming Haki!

297
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,550
The fierce battle between Smoker and Vergo intensifies,

298
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,750
as Smoker puts his spirit and
pride as a Marine on the line.

299
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,800
On the next episode of One Piece!

300
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,150
"Fists Collide!
A Battle of the Two Vice Admirals!"

301
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
