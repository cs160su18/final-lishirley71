2
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,650
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,280
However, no one has ever fully explored it

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,410
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

6
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,130
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

7
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,210
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

8
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,660
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

9
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

11
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,600
After surviving a fierce battle,

12
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,980
the Straw Hats finally entered the New World,

13
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,340
-- the harshest sea ruled
by the Four Emperors.

14
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,510
They landed on Punk Hazard;

15
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,200
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

16
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,540
Luffy learned about the hideous experiments

17
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,030
performed by Caesar Clown, the Master,

18
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,080
and headed off to investigate.

19
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,600
So the clan split up. However...

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,290
What are they?

21
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,670
They are footprints, aren't they?

22
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,270
Is it an animal? If it's a
human, he must be a Giant.

23
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,300
I sense something.

24
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,520
Two beast-looking creatures.

25
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,430
What're we gonna do?!

26
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,480
Where are they?!

27
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,860
Law? The Master?

28
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,070
No, we're on a snow-capped
mountain so it must be them!

29
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,360
The Snow Mountain Killers - stalking
out from deep in the snowstorm!

30
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,540
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

31
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,370
Your name is also on our kill list.

32
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,420
You guys, you didn't harm
my friends, did you?!

33
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,350
Oh? Where did he go?!

34
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,440
They took Nami with them!

35
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,200
"Save Nami! Luffy's Fight on
the Snow-Capped Mountains!"

36
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,030
They kidnapped Nami?!

37
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,540
It was my fault.

38
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,040
Even though they were very big,

39
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,670
I didn't notice they were there until

40
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,420
they appeared in front of my eyes.

41
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,450
First, it was centaurs and now, beast men?!

42
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,630
There are a bunch of strange creatures here!

43
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,800
Maybe they were waiting for their
chance to attack us somewhere.

44
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,510
They didn't come here to save Brown-gator?!

45
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,140
It seemed like their main purpose
was to kill us and take the kids.

46
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,110
But first, they killed Brownbeard
at the Master's command.

47
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,480
They were supposed to be on the same side.

48
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,900
Brownbeard admired him so much.

49
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,790
The Master was our warm-hearted savior!

50
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,950
Luffy!

51
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,950
This Master guy is a very twisted person.

52
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,330
I can't let these kids go
back to such an evil person!

53
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,380
I can't help worrying about
Nami in Franky's body, too!

54
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,880
We don't know what they're gonna do to her!

55
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,840
Yes, I'll get her back at any cost!

56
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,260
You guys, look after those kids!

57
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,010
Wait, Luffy!

58
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,810
It's my body that they took!

59
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,040
Chopper, I can't fight like this!

60
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,730
Give me the bean that you
eat when you transform

61
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,190
yourself into a monster!

62
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,550
It's not a bean!

63
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,740
The Rumble Ball is a power drug!

64
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,200
I don't think you can control it.

65
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,030
I can handle it with my super spirit!

66
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,210
Just give it to me! There's no time to argue!

67
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,830
I have no choice.

68
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,880
What?

69
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,050
Just one, okay?

70
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,970
Really?! It was in this
pocket the whole time?!

71
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,680
Of course it was. It's Chopper's.

72
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,100
Listen. You can become a monster
for just three minutes.

73
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,810
You can't fight after that.

74
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,540
So if possible, transform into Kung
Fu Boost like I did earlier and...

75
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,030
What?!

76
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,490
Buber!

77
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,450
That's way too early!

78
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's go, Franky! This way!

79
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,090
Why're you attacking me?!

80
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh no! He's out of control as I thought!

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,360
So is there much point to Franky going?

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,750
After running wild, he won't
be able to move for a while

83
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,870
so he's not gonna be helpful at all.

84
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,200
Instead, he's going to be in the way.

85
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,280
CAESAR'S LABORATORY

86
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,370
I don't know where he got it but
this "Cyborg" Franky guy has...

87
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,290
...Vegapunk's laser weapon
mounted in his body.

88
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,130
I'll make good use of Vegapunk's invention.

89
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,430
After I chop his body up and
take the laser system out,

90
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,140
he will be useless. Get
the incinerator ready!

91
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,980
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,310
What's going on with the Navy
idiots who came to steal the ship?

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,690
Ah, yes.

94
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,320
We ambushed them successfully but...

95
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,870
--What are they?!
--Humans?! No, horses?!

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
Kill them all!

97
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,380
We won't get beaten that easily!

98
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,550
Look behind you!

99
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,510
What?!

100
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,520
Here we come!

101
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,850
There are more!

102
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,400
--This is no good!
--Nowhere to go!

103
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,330
We have to change tactics!

104
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,640
Let's try to seize the ship in full force!

105
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,800
Captain-chan... I mean, Smoker-san!

106
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,220
The battle is out of control now.

107
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,940
You mean...

108
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,890
...we're having a hard fight.

109
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,890
I mean...

110
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,390
I have an idea!

111
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,940
M-Master?

112
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,990
We're dealing with the Navy.

113
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,360
It's the perfect opportunity to test it!

114
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,500
Yeah, that's great! Let's do that!

115
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,260
Contact the centaurs who are on patrol now.

116
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,090
Yes, sir!

117
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,210
Tell all the other soldiers
evacuate if they want to survive.

118
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,610
THE MOUNTAIN BEHIND THE LABORATORY

119
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,350
Let me go! Let me go, you fools!

120
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,900
What's wrong with you guys?! You perverts!

121
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,290
What're you gonna do to me?!

122
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,510
I know I'm pretty and have a good figure

123
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,470
so you couldn't help kidnapping me!

124
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,840
What is this guy talking about?

125
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,830
He must be a queer. That's cool.

126
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,000
You're gonna pay for this!
Luffy won't tolerate it!

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
I hope you two get your asses kicked!

128
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,690
Be quiet for a moment. Noisy
people like you are...

129
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,810
...Not cool.

130
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,020
But the weapons that are
mounted in your body are...

131
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,350
...Cool.

132
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,320
If we give them to the Master,
our reward will be...

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,340
...So cool!

134
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,410
ROCK

135
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,410
It's cold today as always.

136
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,670
SCOTCH

137
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,230
My body's cool!

138
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,540
THE SNOW MOUNTAIN KILLERS
THE YETI COOL BROTHERS

139
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,590
Then put some clothes on!

140
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,300
Our rifles are like cannons to you people.

141
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,320
We have poison gas canisters, too.

142
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,970
Nobody can beat us because
we don't show ourselves.

143
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,270
You said your friend will come?

144
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm sure he'll come. We
set a trap to lure him.

145
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,360
People can't help following
footprints in the snow.

146
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,930
Footprints! Footprints! How helpful!

147
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,370
They are pretty easy to follow!

148
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,650
Hey, Franky, I said stop!

149
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,590
Oh?

150
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,680
The footprints end there...

151
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,020
Huh?

152
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,520
Luffy and Chopper... No, Franky?!

153
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,760
Nami!

154
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,380
Watch out! They're around!

155
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,490
Shall we, Scotch?

156
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,290
Okay! He didn't notice there
was a cliff. He is so careless!

157
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,040
There are spikes at the bottom!

158
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,460
--Die in vain.
--Get skewered by the Ice Spikes!

159
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,840
Armament Hardening!

160
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,010
Gum-Gum...

161
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,310
...Gatling!

162
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,530
I see. He's a little
trickier than the others.

163
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,540
Those two from before!

164
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,880
Second Gear!

165
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,170
Gum-Gum...

166
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,420
...Jet...

167
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,300
...Pistol!

168
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Jet...

169
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,450
...Stamp!

170
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,140
They're gone, again!

171
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,150
Fool. We know these mountains
like our own backyard.

172
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,120
There are so many places
that we can hide ourselves!

173
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,790
THE BURNING LANDS

174
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,170
It must be around here.

175
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,170
The place that the Master mentioned.

176
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,300
It's a huge building.

177
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,950
Is it a warehouse?

178
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,140
It's kind of eerie.

179
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,400
This door is the one, right?
Okay, let me open it.

180
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,360
It's tight! Guys, give me a hand!

181
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,040
I think I heard something.

182
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,560
I didn't hear a thing.

183
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,760
Hey, we've been told not to go
anywhere near here, haven't we?

184
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,110
Is it really okay to open it?

185
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,380
The Master was the one who told us
that and he wants us to open it.

186
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,900
You don't trust the Master?

187
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,580
N-No, that's not what I meant!

188
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,120
Then stop complaining and lend a hand!

189
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,820
They move so fast even though they're so big.

190
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,300
Oh yeah!

191
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,590
Gum-Gum...

192
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,350
It's a dead-end for you!

193
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,060
...Balloon!

194
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,890
It's a waste to use this power only

195
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,020
defensively just letting the
bullets bounce randomly.

196
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,150
That's what Rayleigh said.

197
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,790
He said I should focus on redirecting

198
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,900
every single one of them
back with twice the force!

199
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,700
Gum-Gum...

200
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,380
...Fire Salute!

201
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,790
Rock!

202
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,330
He did it!

203
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,090
Stop, Franky!

204
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,960
Why are you struggling with him more?!

205
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,670
My body's hot.

206
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,400
Are they having a falling
out now? Screw them!

207
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,730
Stop!

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,930
Just see if you don't!

209
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,900
Icy mountains are filled
with potential weapons.

210
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,290
Watch out! The tip of an
icy mountain is gonna fall!

211
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,420
Luffy! Franky! Look up!

212
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,010
You can't get away from it!

213
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,280
The other one is right there, too!

214
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,570
Choke on this KYP gas canister that
will make you drunk in a second

215
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,930
and drop dead like your friends!

216
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,110
He did something useful!

217
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,290
All right! That was great, Franky!

218
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,470
Hey, enough already!

219
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,010
Third Gear!

220
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,470
Gum-Gum...

221
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,180
...Elephant Gun!

222
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,400
He used one of his most daring attack there?!

223
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,940
No!

224
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,990
Luffy!

225
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,320
Oh no!

226
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,240
Sorry, Franky and Chopper!

227
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll ask Chopper to treat you later!

228
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
Wait!

229
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,570
I told you. We know these
mountains like our own backyard.

230
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,090
You can't catch up with me!

231
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,630
Help me!

232
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,160
Nami!

233
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,930
You just won't give up!

234
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,950
But I can reach way farther than you!

235
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,920
Whoa! He's like a monkey.

236
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,170
Alright!

237
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,140
Damn! Since it's a huge mountain
range, it'd be a pain if I lose them!

238
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,070
He's...

239
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,240
Oh, you're the free-loader---
Trafalgar Law, aren't you?

240
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,310
I'm glad to see you here.

241
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,240
I was chased by Straw Hat Luffy and...

242
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,580
Room.

243
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,790
What?

244
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,160
You bastard! What are you doing?!

245
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,640
Counter Shock.

246
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,310
Thank you!

247
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,550
No! Hey you, give me back my body!

248
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,130
Nami!

249
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,920
Luffy!

250
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,630
Oh, Tra-guy!

251
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,380
Did you save Nami?

252
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,730
I've been thinking.

253
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,060
And I came here to talk to you
about something, Straw Hat-ya.

254
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,950
I think you arrived on
this island by accident.

255
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,810
But there is an important key
lying somewhere on this island

256
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,230
that can wreak havoc in the New World.

257
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,150
There are only two ways to
survive in the New World.

258
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,000
Either by living under the Four Emperors

259
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,660
or going against them.

260
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,330
And I guess you're not a kind of person
who wants to work under someone.

261
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,310
Yeah, I want to stay as a captain.

262
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,410
Then, we have to form an alliance!

263
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,750
What?

264
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,320
An alliance?

265
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,820
If you and I join forces, maybe we can do it.

266
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,240
I have a plan...

267
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,380
...to bring down one of the Four Emperors!

268
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,830
Law declares to defeat the Four Emperors.

269
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,740
Nami and the others can't help but be hesitant by the frightening details...

270
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,600
But Luffy's answer surprises not only his crew,

271
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,590
but Law, as well.

272
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,600
Meanwhile, Caesar was also setting

273
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,390
a terrible plan in motion.

274
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

275
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,690
"Formed! Luffy and Law's Pirate Alliance!"

276
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,930
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
