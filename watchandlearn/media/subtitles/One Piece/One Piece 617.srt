2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

4
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,310
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,000
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

6
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

8
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

9
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,190
The Straw Hats landed on Punk Hazard;

10
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,550
an island with two parts, one
burning, the other frozen.

11
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,900
They learned about the ruler of the island
---Caesar Clown's motive

12
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,240
and all while trying to escape Shinokuni,

13
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,160
along with their pirate ally
- the Warlord - Trafalgar Law,

14
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,250
Luffy and the others are on
the move to kidnap Caesar,--

15
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,170
save the children, and
escape from the island.

16
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,870
I have that crazy pirate backing me!

17
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,890
One of the Seven Warlords
- Don Quixote Doflamingo!

18
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,040
I said...

19
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,230
...I don't care!

20
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,570
I broke... the gear!

21
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,820
Now,

22
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,470
there is no turning back!

23
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,370
"Caesar's Defeat!-- The
Powerful Grizzly Magnum!"

24
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,280
The deadly gas - Shinokuni will fill
up the building-- in five minutes.

25
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,560
The survivors are all heading
toward R Building -

26
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,100
the "R-66" door, the only
exit to escape. However...

27
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,530
B BUILDING - SANJI

28
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,910
The ceiling lifted up just now!

29
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,540
What just happened?!

30
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,420
The gas has started flowing
in from the cracks!

31
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
This is no good.

32
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,950
--Everybody! Get to R Building now!
--Run!

33
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,150
But I'm scared, Sis!

34
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,680
I can't run anymore!

35
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,770
We have no time for wimping out, kids!

36
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,840
Stand up and run!

37
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
Don't give up, everybody!

38
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
Stand up! Now!

39
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,400
--Captain-chan!
--I'm glad that you're okay!

40
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
So you beat that bird woman, huh?!

41
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,420
But why are they coming from that direction?!

42
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,830
I thought they were behind
us to let us get away!

43
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,380
The G-5 is coming this way?!

44
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,940
I told you we were going the wrong way!

45
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,750
That aside, p-put me down!
This is embarrassing!

46
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,260
That's a pain! Just stay where you are!

47
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,470
Hey! Who said you can carry
Tashigi-chan on your shoulder?!

48
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,870
Zoro! Head back!

49
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,530
--Hurry up, everybody!
--This way!

50
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,760
"Broke the gear"?

51
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,610
"There's no turning back"?

52
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
That's hysterical.

53
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,160
Realize your place!

54
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,410
Law!

55
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,630
B BUILDING 2ND FLOOR - THE EXAMINATION ROOM

56
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,420
The ceiling's gonna collapse!

57
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,630
Chopper-yan, it's not safe to stay here!

58
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Uh-huh! I've done all I could for now!

59
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,680
Go to R Building now!

60
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Alright, count on us! Let's go, guys!

61
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,350
Yeah!

62
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,440
Mocha! Stay with me! Let's get out of here!

63
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,330
Damn.

64
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,410
How will I eat breakfast tomorrow?

65
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,300
What a horrible turn of events.

66
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,130
How dare you, Law.

67
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,550
This is an upset.

68
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,720
But I know you're going to regret it.

69
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,330
Keep that in mind.

70
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,740
You don't know Joker's past.

71
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,180
And that will cost you your life!

72
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,370
Upstarts like you who have
acquired just a touch of fame

73
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,280
can't hope to take over the world.

74
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,440
It's filled with those
who are much stronger.

75
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,200
Tell him, Smoker.

76
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,190
All you squirts got is energy.

77
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,000
But this world is much...

78
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't worry about me.

79
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,530
Just worry about yourself.

80
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,440
This room will explode.

81
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,120
Goodbye, Vergo the pirate!

82
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,790
R BUILDING 1ST FLOOR

83
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
What was that?

84
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,220
S-Something is falling down!

85
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,980
I know who could have done such a thing!

86
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,270
It must be Law.

87
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,230
What is Vergo doing?!

88
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,610
Master! What's going on?!

89
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,240
--Some of us buried under the wreckage!
--Master!

90
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,700
Dammit!

91
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,210
You assholes ruined my "paradise"!

92
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,700
I wonder if everybody is okay.

93
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,470
Gotta take advantage of this confusion!

94
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,430
Roll!

95
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,300
Alright. Now let's look for
the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs.

96
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,310
You've got to be kidding!

97
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,360
--The Straw Hat member's gone!
--Where did he go?!

98
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,320
Find him!

99
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,200
R Building 2nd floor, can you hear me?

100
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,330
Oh, it's the Master!

101
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,830
If the Master is okay,
we're gonna be alright!

102
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,630
Secret room, come in!

103
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,460
Yes, Master, what just happened?

104
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,630
Open the air vents now!

105
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,130
Let Shinokuni flow into this room!

106
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,160
B-But that will...

107
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm a gas man. I'm not gonna die.

108
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,800
R-Roger!

109
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,530
Then let's get our fellow soldiers
on the 1st floor upstairs first!

110
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,960
I said "Now"!

111
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,480
I said "Do it now"!

112
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,860
Stop complaining and just do it already!

113
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,410
But there are over a hundred soldiers!

114
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,410
I don't care, you idiot!

115
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,790
You guys are just a bunch of guinea pigs!

116
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,120
No one would care if
hundreds of you die or not!

117
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,040
You are the dregs of society!

118
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,830
What are you doing?! Can't you hear me?!

119
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,820
I can find replacements
for you fools so easily!

120
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,660
Shinokuni is my true power!

121
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,720
That was close!

122
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,360
Now they know who Caesar really is.

123
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,850
Zoro and the others!

124
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,730
They're really in danger!

125
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,070
Could I control the doors
from here, by any chance?

126
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,460
Hey! Why're you looking at me like that?

127
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,180
Huh? N-No, I...

128
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,330
Oh, I get it!

129
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
The Master is trying to fool the enemies!

130
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,790
What?

131
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,600
Oh yeah! You're right!

132
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,550
He must have a plan about
the deadly gas, too!

133
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,310
He's not gonna let his people die!

134
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,980
Right, right!

135
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,300
The Master is a kind man. It would hurt him

136
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,820
if he finds out we suspected him.

137
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,110
Master! I opened the air vents!

138
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,660
No! The deadly gas!

139
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
It's flowing in!

140
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,330
Yes. You should've done
as I said from the start!

141
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,590
Dregs shouldn't think!

142
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,380
Now, become my power! Shinokuni!

143
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,710
LAND OF DEATH

144
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,010
This is my scientific power!

145
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,840
It's kicking in.

146
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,570
Look, Straw Hat Luffy!
This amazing appearance!

147
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,790
This is my scientific power!

148
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,590
Through this experiment,

149
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,500
two countries have already expressed
interest in the weapon - Shinokuni.

150
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,290
They are both quite peaceful.

151
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,920
But when humans get serious
about defending themselves,

152
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,800
they'll look for any way
possible to kill their enemies!

153
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,980
Everybody needs me!

154
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,260
I'll spread weapons all over the world

155
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,970
and become the king of the
land of death (Shinokuni)!

156
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,310
Look!

157
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,010
Run!

158
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,280
No...

159
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,900
--He killed our fellow soldiers!
--What is he doing?!

160
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,040
Master!

161
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,960
Does he really think of us as guinea pigs?

162
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,930
It's amazing if I do say so myself!

163
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,280
Look how fast it works on their nerves!

164
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,890
That's almost an art!

165
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,260
Wh-What... What was that?

166
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,730
Those people are...

167
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,810
Momo, look after Brownbeard.

168
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,040
Huh? Okay!

169
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,330
Hey, where are you going, Straw Hat Luffy?!

170
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,980
Did you chicken out all of a sudden?!

171
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,230
What a pathetic man!

172
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,430
But B Building beyond that path is
almost filled up with Shinokuni!

173
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,450
There is no place to run
on the island anymore!

174
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,520
That goes for all of you guinea pigs, too!

175
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,370
All of you,

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,410
die...

177
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,840
...like trash!

178
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,880
That's who the Master really is?!

179
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,010
Master!

180
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,220
I trusted him so!

181
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,440
Excuse me. I know you're broken-hearted
but could I sit in that control seat?

182
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,610
I wanna save my friends from the gas!

183
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,920
You bastard!

184
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,070
You were watching it, weren't you? Dammit!

185
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,450
Stop! I know you all watched it, too.

186
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,160
Yeah, you're right. We've
been terribly betrayed!

187
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,770
We're finished.

188
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,890
Now we know that he was our enemy but...

189
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,340
...we can't run from here!

190
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,090
But so are you people!

191
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,970
Did you just see your
captain run from Caesar?!

192
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,870
That serves you right!

193
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,180
He took off leaving you guys behind!

194
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,690
Whoa-whoa, are you dissing our
captain right in front of me?

195
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,950
If he were the kind of
person who would betray us,

196
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,180
it would've been easier for me.

197
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,330
I would've just run away with
my tail between my legs!

198
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,080
Third Gear!

199
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,670
But he never ever stops...

200
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,340
...believing in us...

201
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,180
...so we had no choice but to support him.

202
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,140
We pledged to live up to his
expectations as long as we breathe!

203
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,310
Master, please don't...

204
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,450
You people are just crumbs. You
shouldn't stand against your master!

205
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,460
Just drop dead like a dog!

206
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,670
--What should we do?
--There's nothing we can do.

207
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,690
We can't beat such a powerful man!

208
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,970
--Yes, you can!
--What?

209
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,550
You guys should just believe in our captain!

210
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,060
Caesar is...

211
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,970
...the type of person that
Luffy hates the most!

212
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,700
H-Help me, Master!

213
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,620
Yes!

214
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,660
I am the Master!

215
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,340
I am your savior and I can make efficient
use of you good-for-nothings!

216
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,180
Luffy won't forgive Caesar!

217
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,880
Armament Hardening!

218
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,360
Caesar!

219
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,030
You're back, Straw Hat Luffy!

220
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't ever wanna see your face again!

221
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,670
Your death is going to be the
climax of this experiment show!

222
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,130
Go to hell!

223
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,970
Gum-Gum...

224
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,600
...Grizzly Magnum!

225
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,210
Now, drop dead! Behold my scientific power!

226
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,090
Kneel before my power!

227
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,810
Shut up!

228
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,090
Oh yeah, Straw Hat!

229
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,840
You can work under me if you want...

230
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,710
Luffy has crushed Caesar.

231
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
The shocking news...

232
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,980
...spreads across the New
World in the blink of an eye.

233
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,530
Meanwhile...

234
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,530
...an assassin sent by Doflamingo...

235
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,020
...flies toward the island of Punk Hazard.

236
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,230
The storm of a new battle rages!

237
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

238
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,300
"Raid! An Assassin from Dressrosa!"

239
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
