2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,300
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,500
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,680
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,690
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,410
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,370
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,710
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,460
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,970
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,340
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:41,010
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,360
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,300
Let me tell you something...

20
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,610
You can't save this country.

21
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,270
Goodbye, Princess...

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,680
Crocodile!!

23
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,530
Luffy-san!

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,190
Straw Hat...!

25
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,440
Luffy's alive!

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm gonna put an end... to all this!

27
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,070
You can't turn into sand
once you touch water.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,800
You take rain away because
you're afraid of water, right?

29
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,330
Now I can beat you up.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,060
Our fight starts now.

31
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,440
"Sand Gator and Water Luffy!
The Second Round of the Duel"

32
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,220
Now, get up! Crocodile!

33
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,420
Get up! Gator man!

34
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,990
What?!

35
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,830
A cannonball will be shot
into the Square in ten minutes?!

36
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,130
That's right. The attack is scheduled at 4:30.

37
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,590
--4:30?!
--What?

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,470
Once it's shot, no one within
a 5 km diameter will survive.

39
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,220
That's what Crocodile said!

40
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,580
Within a 5 km diameter... Then...

41
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,930
Both the Royal Army and the Rebel
Army will be completely destroyed!

42
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,020
That damn gator!

43
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,560
Wh-What the hell will we do?

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,590
Find the cannoneer.

45
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,360
What?

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,650
We'll stop the attack!

47
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,230
Find the cannoneer?

48
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,130
So how do we find him?!

49
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,330
In ten minutes?!

50
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,900
We don't have time to think, right?!

51
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:57,330
But a 5 km diameter means this guy's
aiming at least 2.5 km from here, right?!

52
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,840
No, that's not true! The cannoneer
is probably near this Square!

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,490
What?! Why?! If that's the case,
the cannoneer will also be blown up...

54
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,530
So that's the kind of man Crocodile is...

55
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,190
He doesn't care if his own men die?!

56
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,640
What a crafty bastard...

57
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,810
Let's go, already!

58
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,340
Yipe!

59
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,380
We found you, Princess Vivi!

60
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,880
I wonder how far I'll be
promoted if I kill you...

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,090
Billions!

62
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,490
Ten minutes minus how many seconds?!

63
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,180
Hey, we're wasting time by talking.

64
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,900
Two seconds!

65
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,270
I'll go on ahead!

66
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,350
I'll go on ahead!

67
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,730
1.5 seconds!

68
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,110
Don't slow down, idiot!

69
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,270
Same to you!

70
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,040
Let's split up! At any rate, we gotta
get out of this dust devil first!

71
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,330
Ten more minutes...!

72
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,580
Okay, hurry up! Let's go!

73
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,300
Yeah!

74
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,130
This is really... the last chance!

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,490
The next ten minutes...
will decide... this country's fate...!

76
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,560
You think... you can defeat me...?

77
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,690
Yeah... since you no
longer can turn into sand.

78
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,450
I'm indeed impressed
that you figured it out...

79
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,650
...especially when you were close to dying...

80
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,400
But that is still nowhere near enough
to put you on the same level as me.

81
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,910
That's the level of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

82
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,290
So what if you're one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea?

83
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,020
Then, I'm one of the...

84
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,880
...Eight Warlords of the Sea!

85
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,190
Who on earth is that man?

86
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,890
He's a pirate. Haven't you heard?

87
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,610
Looks like the princess
escaped death once again.

88
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,400
Then he is the one... who brought
Vivi back to this country...

89
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,790
Gum-Gum...

90
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,170
...Pistol!

91
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,500
It's no good if I dodge it.

92
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,260
Whether it's wet or not...

93
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,660
...my hand can absorb any kind of fluid.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,220
Sh-Shoot! I forgot he still had that power!

95
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,530
You told me, didn't you...?

96
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,800
Depending on how Devil Fruit powers
are used, you can become stronger.

97
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,330
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

98
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,180
Shotgun!

99
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,740
Impertinent brat! Desert Spada!

100
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,340
That thing again?!

101
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,550
That was close...

102
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,380
Gum-Gum...!

103
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,860
You keep using the same technique...
Are you really trying to win?

104
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,430
Yeah!

105
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,010
Totally!

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,740
My goal was this from the start!
Time to get soaking wet!

107
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,480
That's obviously what
you'd wanna do! Sables!

108
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,850
Barrel! Barrel!

109
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,910
You're struggling desperately,
Straw Hat Luffy...

110
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,660
You can't do anything
without that barrel after all.

111
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,700
This isn't any different from our first fight.

112
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,390
You're right.

113
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,310
It's no different like this.

114
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,500
Then, how about this?!

115
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
Now, I'm not the same as I was.

116
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,740
Are you serious?

117
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,670
Water Luffy!

118
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,800
Ahh! This is bad! Water's leaking!

119
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,390
Is this brat... serious...?

120
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,590
Bloated with water...

121
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,480
I guess I shouldn't drink this much water...

122
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,640
Doesn't he get what's happening right now?

123
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,700
Stop messing around, you damn brat!

124
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,500
Dammit!

125
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,430
Who's messing around?!

126
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,010
My body...

127
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm always serious! Gum-Gum...!

128
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
...Bazooka!!

129
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,070
How's that... sand gator?!

130
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,920
I can't believe it...! He beat the Crocodile...

131
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,570
Who on earth is that boy...?

132
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,760
This is no time to be
impressed, right, Mr. Cobra?

133
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,450
Now, you show me the way...
to where the Poneglyph is!

134
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,950
What in the world are you
going to do... by looking at it?

135
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,380
Don't ask pointless questions.

136
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,860
All you have to do is show me the way...

137
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,700
I wonder if your luck is running out...
There isn't much time left.

138
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,680
Go already, Nico Robin...
unless you wanna be dried up, too.

139
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm losing... my patience...

140
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,490
Nico Robin?!

141
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes, as you wish.

142
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,930
Listen up, Straw Hat.

143
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,160
Every rock on the ground can be destroyed.

144
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,310
The grass is withering away!

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,980
Ground Secco!

146
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,670
What the heck...?!

147
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,870
I'm falling...!

148
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,950
That was close!

149
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,080
That bastard! Water-Water Pistol!

150
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,720
What?! He swallowed it all with his hand!

151
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,680
You thought you killed
my powers, Water Luffy...?

152
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,470
But that's a mistake.

153
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,630
The true power of sand is drying. Look!

154
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:12,610
My right hand dries out
everything... with no limit...

155
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,300
Stones... and even stone
statues are becoming sand...

156
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,800
The ground... is dying...!

157
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,610
Ah! My sandals dried up, too!

158
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,730
Everything that's connected
to this hand... Dry up!

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,080
Ground Death!

160
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,600
Where is he?! Where's the cannoneer?!

161
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,750
We've only got eight minutes.

162
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,370
If we have eight minutes, we can find him!

163
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,310
We'll stop the attack
no matter what happens!

164
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,480
Or the lives of a million
people will be destroyed!

165
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,180
A cannonball that can
blow up a 5 km diameter...

166
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,190
It has to be a big cannon!
Could it be inside a building?!

167
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,740
Dammit!

168
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,590
But wait...! If Alubarna is completely
destroyed in eight minutes...

169
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,310
...does that mean that we're all
going to die in eight minutes as well?

170
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,750
We don't have time to be scared!

171
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,350
Look! That's it!

172
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,070
Tsk!

173
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,350
C-Can we go up there... in eight minutes?

174
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,690
H-Hey!

175
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,230
Ahh, dammit!

176
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,150
You...! Are you from the Rebel Army?!

177
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,620
I don't have time to waste on you.

178
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,900
Go to sleep.

179
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,800
That's it! That's it!

180
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,750
This isn't it! It's got moss on it!

181
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,100
I don't see him... anywhere...!
There's no sign of a cannoneer!

182
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,110
Why...? Why?!

183
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,680
Seven minutes left...

184
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll stop it... I'll...

185
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,290
Nico Robin... Is that your real name?

186
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,190
What if it is? It has nothing to do with you.

187
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,670
A girl whose name was known
throughout the world 20 years ago...

188
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,500
Why... are you here now...?

189
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,930
All you have to do is show me
the way to the Poneglyph...

190
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,870
What incredible timing you
have showing up now, Navy.

191
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,390
Clear the way. We're in a hurry.

192
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,980
We can't! I heard everything
that's going on here in Alubarna

193
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,420
from a soldier on the ground.

194
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,200
Who do you think that person is?!

195
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,410
Well, I don't care who it is.
I hate people in the Government.

196
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,910
If you don't get out of my way...

197
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,900
We don't have the slightest
intention of giving way to you!

198
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,080
Then I might have to kill you.

199
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,670
Wait, Navy! Don't worry about me!

200
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,040
We've been warned that at 4:30 pm,
a cannonball will be shot

201
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,130
into the Palace Square where
the rebellion is going on right now!

202
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,820
Please stop it somehow!

203
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,330
What...?! Seven more minutes...!

204
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,020
A million citizens' lives are at stake!

205
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
But...

206
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,210
Then we'll save you and stop the explosion!

207
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,870
Wait! This woman is...!

208
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,640
Ready!

209
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,100
Don't get in my way!

210
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,860
Treinta Fleurs!

211
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,500
Strangle!

212
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,990
Devil Fruit Powers...

213
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,870
I said I was in a hurry, didn't I?
Don't make me upset!

214
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,120
Sergeant Major! This woman... is Nico Robin!

215
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,150
There's no mistake!

216
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,380
As Captain Smoker asked,
I looked for her wanted poster.

217
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,170
She's got a bounty and was talked
about worldwide 20 years ago!

218
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,800
I remember the articles appearing
in newspapers around that time.

219
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,320
There was an incident where
six Navy warships were sunk.

220
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,130
They said that a girl who was only
eight years old was responsible for it.

221
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,130
The Government declared her
a first-degree risk factor,

222
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,400
and the bounty put on her head was...
believe it or not, 79 million berries!

223
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,300
However, she suddenly
disappeared after that.

224
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,330
Stop your rambling!
Are you gonna clear the way?

225
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,240
Or do you all wanna die? Which is it?!

226
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,500
It seems there's no point in having
many soldiers against this woman...

227
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Sergeant! Take everyone to the
Square and stop the explosion!

228
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,200
But, Sergeant Major...!

229
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Hurry up! There's only six minutes left!

230
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,510
Yes, ma'am!

231
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,890
Now, let that man go!

232
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,990
I said you're in my way!

233
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,740
That was close!
His right hand is a problem...

234
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,440
The lawn has turned into desert!

235
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,010
Where'd he go?

236
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,700
You made me waste my energy...

237
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,050
You missed...

238
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
Cro...co...

239
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,310
You... lose again...

240
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,300
Straw Hat Luffy...

241
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,950
Which direction should I run towards
to see a more wonderful tomorrow?

242
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,890
I took the helm and opened the
miraculous map that I stored in my heart

243
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,120
I aimed for the sky and sought out
my dreams, though at times I got lost

244
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,570
It wasn't a dream; when I met you,
I discovered the wonderful person in me

245
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:50,790
With just a bit of courage,
I gained something grand

246
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,250
Now's the time for my "wish"
to become my "pledge"

247
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,000
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

248
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,750
Let's sketch out the tale of the future

249
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,140
I'll put all my feelings
in a brand new wind now

250
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,100
Shining ray! Find your brand new way

251
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,280
A never-ending journey to be together

252
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll chase after you
wherever you go, Shining ray

253
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,550
This is a good way to die, Straw Hat Luffy...

254
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,870
Dammit! There isn't much
time left till the attack!

255
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,840
You small fry...

256
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,170
What the heck are you doing?!

257
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,050
I'm trying to put myself in Crocodile's shoes!

258
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,080
Forget it! Just look for him!

259
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,100
This is really... the last chance!
It will decide this country's fate...!

260
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,430
On the next episode of One Piece!

261
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,430
"That Looks Gator-ish!
Luffy, Run to the Royal Tomb!"

262
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
