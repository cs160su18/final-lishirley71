2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,940
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,760
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ to rescue his brother,

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,740
Ace who will be executed in public!

62
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,580
Meanwhile, the Whitebeard
Pirates storming Marineford...

63
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,000
...begin an all-out war with the Navy!

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,120
Ace-kun...

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,590
Oars!

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,430
Climb Oars' body and advance!

67
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,880
What's that?

68
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,350
Heehaw!

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,870
"Straw Hat Team Arrives! Tension
Grows at the Battlefield"

70
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,120
I feel a chill in my heart!

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey, partner! Can't you do something?!

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,010
Do you really think that
wax will help in any way?!

73
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,970
Why are Luffy and the others
falling from the sky?

74
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,400
We have to go back a little bit in
time to know what happened to them.

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,530
The ship that they were on was
hit by Whitebeard's seaquake.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,280
It's speeding up!

77
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,490
H-Hey! Look at that!

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,130
Wh-What the hell is that?!

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,220
It's a tsunami!

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,220
--It's really big!
--We're gonna get caught!

81
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,250
The sea just suddenly drew back and now there's a big tsunami.

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,400
This must be...

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,100
Hey, Jimbei! We gotta do something or...

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,900
I don't want to be defeated
by a tsunami here!

85
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,940
I... I gotta save Ace!

86
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,950
Take in the sails!

87
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,410
Luffy-kun, let's ride on the tsunami!

88
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,080
Shouldn't we get away?!

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,250
What are saying, you ass?!

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,000
Turn around already!

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,710
Hey, stop it!

92
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,250
--We gotta hurry!
--Jump into the sea!

93
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,920
Help! Help!

94
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,840
How long have you been a pirate?

95
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,800
Are you a bunch of amateurs?

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,960
If we turn around now, we'll take the

97
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,610
wave on the side of the ship and capsize.

98
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,730
We don't have any option.

99
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,310
That's right!

100
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,190
Hang tight so you don't get
washed off by the big wave!

101
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,610
Damn!

102
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,030
Hurry up!

103
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,530
Just hang onto something!

104
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,870
My face is too big.

105
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,430
What happened?

106
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,430
--The wave stopped moving!
--What happened?!

107
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,000
What the hell?!

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,890
The ship has iced in and
we're completely trapped!

109
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,350
This must have done by...

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,990
Look down. You can see what's going on.

111
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,910
--Old man...
--The war has begun already.

112
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,830
Old man must have set that
tsunami as a declaration of war.

113
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,210
And this freezing is the
work of Admiral Aokiji.

114
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,880
Guys, listen!

115
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,800
I got an idea to get us through this!

116
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,430
We gotta hurry! There's less than 3
hours left before Ace's execution!

117
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,890
Uh-huh. And?

118
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,470
What?!

119
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,390
You want the ship to slide
down this frozen wave?!

120
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,230
That's the only way! First, we gotta
get this ship unstuck from the ice!

121
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,360
Are you nuts? It's a Navy
ship! We can't lift it up!

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
He's right, you idiot!

123
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,910
We can do it if we work together!

124
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,990
Oh, that makes me think that I can.

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,290
Yeah! We have the next King of the
Pirates - Captain Buggy on our side!

126
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,750
When Captain says that he can
do it, he will do it for sure!

127
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,510
Ring, ring, ring...

128
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,340
Attention, all ships and
soldiers! The target is TOTTZ.

129
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,470
Change the line and make
the shift to operation 3.

130
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,520
--It's a Navy operational message.
--Advance the preparation!

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,440
TOT... what was it?

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,770
Dunno. Must be some kind of code.

133
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,100
When you are all set,  we
move the schedule forward...

134
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,280
...and execute Ace immediately. That's all.

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,120
--Luffy-kun...
--Let's move!

136
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,790
This can't wait any longer.
We don't have time to argue!

137
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,540
Everyone, let's get on with Straw boy's idea!

138
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,010
Let's go!

139
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,140
H-Hey!

140
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,890
No! That's not the side!

141
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,720
And that was how Luffy and
the others started falling!

142
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,060
What just happened?! Did a
Navy ship fall from the sky?!

143
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,020
It's water, thank god. We fell into water.

144
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,190
I thought I was gonna die
by falling on the ice!

145
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Why isn't it frozen around here?

146
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,080
Look! The ship landed in the area
where Jozu had cleared the ice!

147
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,660
Is it a surprise attack from the Navy?

148
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,080
No, they don't look like the Navy.

149
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,340
Climb! Climb up!

150
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,010
It's nothing comparing to
the water torture in hell.

151
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,270
It's inconvenient that Devil
Fruit eaters can't swim.

152
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,740
Where am I?

153
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,670
Oh yeah, I fell from there.

154
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,390
Ace!

155
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,650
Where are you? Where are you, Ace?!

156
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,990
Ace...

157
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,000
Get on the ship!

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,130
He's not on this side!

159
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,770
Where are you, Ace?!

160
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,150
Wait for me, Ace! I'll be there soon!

161
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,660
Don't get in my way!

162
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,130
Ace!

163
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,780
Ace...

164
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:38,230
Ace!!

165
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,520
Luffy!!

166
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,450
Ace!!

167
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,240
I can see you finally!

168
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,470
Luffy!

169
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,060
Ace! Hang on! I'll...

170
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,980
H-Hey, don't tell me that's...!

171
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,690
Crocodile!

172
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,940
That's not all! Who is in that lineup?!

173
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,240
All forces are here on both sides!
There are a lot of big names!

174
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,680
The world's got to be ready for it!

175
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,830
Ace, we're coming to rescue you!

176
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,000
We're here for you!

177
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,790
Garp! It's your family again!

178
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,710
Luffy!

179
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,420
Look! It's not only Straw Hat!

180
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,100
Jimbei and Ivankov of the
Revolutionaries army!

181
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,150
Behind them are many infamous pirates, too!

182
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,720
They must've escaped from Impel Down!

183
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,940
He always causes trouble... Straw Hat.

184
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,520
Straw Hat!

185
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,700
--What brought him here?
--And he's not with his crew.

186
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,620
Luffy! I'm glad that you're alive!

187
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Look, Helmeppo-san!

188
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,960
What?! Nothing'll surprise me any more...

189
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,460
Straw Hat!

190
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,210
I heard that he was captured
at Impel Down! He's so tough!

191
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,170
He brought some big faces!

192
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,600
I didn't expect to see him again this soon.

193
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,060
He's the brother that Ace was talking about.

194
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,140
There's a former and an
active Warlord together!

195
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,650
And that supposed to be the big
troublemaker rookie--Straw Hat!

196
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,980
Smoker-san, look!

197
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,780
Die!

198
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,830
Straw Hat and Crocodile...
Why are they together?

199
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,790
So it is him.

200
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,090
The grandson of the hero--Garp and
the son of the revolutionary--Dragon.

201
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,630
I'll take care of him for good!

202
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,900
Of all things, you're working
alongside Straw Hat Luffy...

203
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,520
So that's your response, Jimbei?!

204
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,780
Yes, it is! I resign from The Seven Warlords!

205
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
It's odd that those people are teaming up.

206
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,480
Prisoners, a commander of
the Revolutionaries army,

207
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,660
some bizarre-looking people and...

208
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,620
...Crocodile.

209
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't think that they have a common goal.

210
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,340
At least, in this battle.

211
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,460
Where's Croco boy?

212
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,630
Oh? I think he chickened out and...

213
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,370
There he is!

214
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,090
He went ahead of me!

215
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,690
--Crocodile is aiming for Whitebeard!
--Pops!

216
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,900
Long time no see, Whitebeard.

217
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,320
You never learn.

218
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,350
He knows too well how to fight against me.

219
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,850
You can't turn into sand
once you touch water.

220
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,900
Now that we are here, our
agreement has been fulfilled.

221
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,450
Why do you want to protect Whitebeard?!

222
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,320
As I thought--this old man is Whitebeard.

223
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,160
Then leave him alone!

224
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,830
Ace likes this old man!

225
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,170
Ace's brother is quite a fighter.

226
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,590
Don't let him come close to Pops!

227
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,870
Everybody was surprised

228
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,420
when a strong guy like you
came back after losing an arm

229
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,570
in the East Blue.

230
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,030
Who is this enemy that you
gave your left arm to?

231
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,870
I put it up for a new generation.

232
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,670
Hey, squirt, that straw hat you have...

233
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,340
...it looks like the one that
"Red-Haired" was once wearing.

234
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,760
Old man, you know Shanks?

235
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,840
Shanks left it to me.

236
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,290
Look, Pops! This is my brother!

237
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,770
You came here to rescue your brother?

238
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,990
Yeah.

239
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,320
Do you know who you're messing with?!

240
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,550
A squirt like you will be dead meat!

241
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,350
Shut up! That's not up to you to decide!

242
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,480
I know what you're up to!

243
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,490
You wanna become the King
of the Pirates, right?!

244
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,740
But I'm the one who'll become the King!

245
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,450
How saucy you are!

246
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,370
I won't forgive you if you
cause me trouble, spoiled brat!

247
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm gonna do as I like!

248
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,550
I'm gonna rescue Ace!

249
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,710
--H-He's competing...
--...With Whitebeard!

250
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,550
It can't be!

251
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,860
We can punish all of them by
death, can't we, Sengoku-san?

252
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,570
Absolutely.

253
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,280
Luffy... Pops...

254
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,700
Hang on, Ace!

255
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,160
I'll get there...

256
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,950
I'll get there very soon!

257
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,130
At the Navy HQ, Luffy leads the charge
against the massive forces there.

258
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,140
As the men of the Navy attack Luffy in waves,

259
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,600
Ace shouts at him to stay away.

260
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,730
How will Luffy respond to his brother's wish?

261
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,100
On the next episode of One Piece!

262
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,650
"Even If It Means Death!
Luffy vs. the Navy; The Battle Starts!"

263
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
