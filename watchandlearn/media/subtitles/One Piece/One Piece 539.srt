00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop

Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,690

22

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your toughness, that’s what it takes

32

It's not our way to worry

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,230

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540

60
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
The sun of my heart will never set

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580
One, two, Sunshine

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,580

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460

64
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,460
One, two, Sunshine

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
ichi, ni, Sunshine yon...we go!

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,970
One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,410
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,790
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,390
2 years have passed since
the War of the Best.

76
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,020
Luffy and his crew returned
to Sabaody Archipelago

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,280
and on their way to the New World,
they reached the Fish-Man Island

78
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,160
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

79
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,450
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after Shirahoshi,
are engaging in secret maneuvers.

80
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,540
Luffy and the others find
themselves caught up in the turmoil.

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,580
Zoro and the others facing Hordy
and the New Fish-Man Pirates...

82
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,210
...tried to escape after the
tides turned against them

83
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,050
but were caught by Hordy whose
strength was multiplied tremendously

84
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,720
by taking the Energy Steroid.

85
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,230
Meanwhile, Luffy and the others
finally got to the Sea Forest...

86
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,980
The person who is responsible for setting
Arlong loose into the East Blue was...

87
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,900
...me!

88
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:33,210
"The Haunting Ties!
Nami and the Fish-Man Pirates!"

89
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm sure there is a key to the
void in history somewhere here.

90
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,390
The missing piece must have been

91
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,680
lying here secretly at this serene
place for several centuries.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,190
If I keep going, there'll be...

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,570
Here it is!

94
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,240
King Neptune...

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,210
Don't look back!
Think about what the King did for us!

96
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,710
I see the exit!

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,750
Yeah!

98
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,630
We made it outside!

99
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,590
Use the Bubbly Coral!

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,430
What a disaster!

101
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,560
So few soldiers made it out even
after we left the King there!

102
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,600
We failed!

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,980
Stop moaning! It was the King's order!

104
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,230
Men, this is not a retreat!

105
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,740
We will exterminate the pirates in the
palace and rescue the King at any cost!

106
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,110
First, we need to communicate with
Prince Fukaboshi and the others!

107
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,410
Get in touch with the Princes A.S.A.P.
and reorganize the forces...

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,290
...and let's go back to the palace!

109
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:56,910
Yes, sir!

110
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,330
The nearest town from here is...

111
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,040
Fishverly Hills, sir!

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,090
Look out!

113
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,670
FISHVERLY HILLS

114
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,670
Meanwhile, at the high-class
district - Fishverly Hills...

115
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,090
Run!

116
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,350
--All of you, get in line!
--Hurry up if you don't wanna die!

117
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,770
Th-This is... What do you want from us?!

118
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,310
--Step on it!
--What?

119
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,400
--It's a test!
--No way!

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,980
Much...

121
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,780
Shut up! Captain Hordy's
gonna rule this country-ch!

122
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,950
AN OFFICER OF THE NEW FISH-MAN
PIRATES - IKAROS MUCH

123
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,950
Now, step on the image!

124
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,870
No, I can't...

125
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,290
Step on it now!

126
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,670
CANDY FACTORY TOWN

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,670
At Candy Factory Town in the northeast...

128
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,960
Hey, just do it already!

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,380
I can't!

130
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,630
Huh?!

131
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,180
Please forgive me! I can't
tread on the image of her face!

132
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,220
Shut up!

133
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,560
Those who can't do it are human sympathizers.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,560
AN OFFICER OF THE NEW
FISH-MAN PIRATES - DARUMA

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Which means they're our enemies!

136
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,900
IN FRONT OF THE FISH-MAN CULTURAL HALL

137
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,900
In front of the Fish-Man Culture
Hall in the southeast...

138
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,950
Whoa, whoa! It's easy!

139
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,870
AN OFFICER OF THE NEW
FISH-MAN PIRATES - HYOUZOU

140
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,660
It's either step on this image
or flee from this island.

141
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,870
Screw you!

142
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,710
Damn! I can't take it anymore!

143
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,350
Just do it! If somebody
refused to do either...

144
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,180
...I've been told to slice 'em up!

145
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,190
MARINE SHOPPING MALL

146
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,190
At the Marine Shopping Mall in the east...

147
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,190
"Leave the country"? Don't be ridiculous!

148
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,110
This is the only place on the
seafloor that has light.

149
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,860
And we can't live in the humans' world!

150
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,320
See?

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,410
You can see how heartlessly the
humans discriminate against others.

152
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,170
What is it?! What are you doing?!

153
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,040
What's going on?

154
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,840
There is no way that humans
and Fish-Men can get along.

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,050
You must submit to King Hordy!

156
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,220
AN OFFICER OF THE NEW FISH-MAN PIRATES - ZEO

157
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,220
We will reign over humans and change history!

158
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,140
WATERWHEEL TOWN

159
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,140
At Waterwheel Town in the north...

160
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,440
Dosun!

161
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,480
--Now, you're next.
--It's gonna be easy.

162
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,780
I can't!

163
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,820
AN OFFICER OF THE NEW
FISH-MAN PIRATES - DOSUN

164
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm gonna pummel those who
won't step on it-dosun!

165
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,870
Take this!

166
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,910
You're... Fukaboshi! Don't get in my way!

167
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,050
What do you think you are doing?!

168
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,260
How dare you make people of this country
tread on the image of my late mother!

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,940
CORAL HILL

170
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,940
At Coral Hill, after Luffy
and the others left...

171
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,820
--What should we do?!
--We let Vander Decken get away...

172
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,900
...and we couldn't stop the Straw Hats
from taking Princess Shirahoshi away!

173
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,450
But the Princess said that
she'd be back by dinner.

174
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,870
You fool! They made her say it!

175
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,790
A group from the Fish-Man District
is rampaging all over the island!

176
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,080
--What?!
--What's going on on the island?!

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,800
Mermaid girls are going
missing all around the island!

178
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,300
If they sell the Princess
to the Celestial Dragons...

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,140
Hey, it seems like another
Mermaid girl went missing!

180
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm scared!

181
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,560
Oh no!

182
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,860
I took her!

183
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,740
That aside, I just saw something great!

184
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,200
A big size Mermaid-san!

185
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,660
A human-sized Mermaid is worth 70 million

186
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,670
so if I can catch a Mermaid
who is 7 or 8 times bigger

187
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,590
and sell her...

188
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,550
I'll make a bundle!

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,340
Y-You are...

190
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,180
Hello.

191
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,470
Good afternoon!

192
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,230
SEA FOREST

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,650
Father-sama!

194
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,980
Princess Shirahoshi, don't worry.

195
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,700
Maybe they got the King but
they can't really take his life!

196
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,870
What? Are you sure?

197
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,910
Yes. And I will save the King at any cost!

198
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,630
Okay. I will be counting on you, Boss-sama!

199
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,920
Now let me talk to Luffy-kun
and the others for a while.

200
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,350
Ladies!

201
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,810
Have some tea!

202
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,520
Thanks. Leave it there, Sanji-kun.

203
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,400
And we're having a serious
conversation so stop acting like that!

204
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,570
I love you, Nami-san, even
when you're so severe!

205
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,900
Sanji-chin hasn't changed a bit.

206
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,240
Good!

207
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,860
It's not for you!

208
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,120
Now, Jimbei-san.

209
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,210
What do you mean?

210
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,210
You set Arlong loose into the East Blue?

211
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,140
Jimbei-san!

212
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,100
I know.

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,180
That's what I heard.

214
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,350
What?

215
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,350
When Luffy and I first heard the
name Jimbei of the Seven Warlords,

216
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,440
that's what Yosaku told us.

217
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,530
In exchange for joining the Warlords,

218
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,740
Jimbei set loose a terrible
man into the East Blue.

219
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,750
--Was that what he said?
--I bet you don't remember it.

220
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,910
I wonder how Yosaku is doing.

221
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,090
When I read that you were with
Jimbei 2 years ago in the newspaper,

222
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,220
it raised so many questions in my mind.

223
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,850
Because I thought Jimbei was the key
figure who was pulling Arlong's strings.

224
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,890
Hey, Jimbei.

225
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,810
If you wanna make excuses, I'll listen.
But you better watch what you say.

226
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,820
As a matter of fact, this beautiful navigator
- Nami-san here had her home island...

227
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,490
...taken over by Arlong!

228
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,200
And she's been through hell because of it!

229
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,380
Depending on what you have
to say, I might not forgive you!

230
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,180
--Jimbei-san!
--Hatchin!

231
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,390
Your wounds are gonna
open up again! Don't get up!

232
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,430
He's right! We gave her so much pain...

233
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,350
...that we can't heal no matter
how much we apologize.

234
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,090
I’m gonna use my navigation skills
to travel to all the world’s oceans!

235
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,340
And then I’m gonna make a
world map of everything I see!

236
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,970
So your map of this island is your
first step toward your dream, then?

237
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,890
Yeah!

238
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,730
I'm a fill-in mother for
you two, Nami and Nojiko.

239
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,190
You two are my dear family!

240
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,300
Pirates, everyone!

241
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,420
Pirates are coming!

242
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,560
You seem to be in excellent spirits,
pathetic humans!

243
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,640
As of this moment,

244
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,650
this village - no,
this island - is now under my control!

245
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,450
100,000 Berries per adult.
50,000 Berries per kid.

246
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,160
Those who can’t pay… die!

247
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,250
I just can’t say I don’t have a family…

248
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,840
Even… if it costs me my life…

249
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,850
Yeah, maybe we’re not related by blood…

250
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,430
…but we’re a family.

251
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,640
I want to be their parent,
even if it’s only in name.

252
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,190
They’re… my kids.

253
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,440
Die with your pathetic love.

254
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,740
Nojiko! Nami!

255
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,120
I love you!

256
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,510
What's this?

257
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,840
--A sea chart?
--No!

258
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,680
I drew that! It's important
to me! Give it back!

259
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,850
You drew it?

260
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,020
--Give it back!
--Nami! No!

261
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,100
Oh? This is quite impressive.

262
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,190
She’s an invaluable
asset! Bring her with us!

263
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,570
--Right!
--No!

264
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,950
Let go! Let go! No!

265
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,950
We have no food for humans!
Shut up and keep drawing maps!

266
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,470
Gather up 100 million
Berries and bring it here.

267
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Do so and I’ll let the village
go and give you freedom.

268
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,060
Thief! She stole our treasure!

269
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,850
--She's a kid!
--Who cares! Shoot her!

270
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,820
Shit! Go after her!

271
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,750
70 million more...
70 million more to free the village!

272
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,250
Oh, you're back!

273
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,920
Humph! It seems like you
have nowhere else to go.

274
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,050
Welcome home, my dear navigator!

275
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,990
Sounds like you had a terrible experience.

276
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,280
You bastard! Don't distance yourself!

277
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,490
Yes.

278
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,410
It would never make me change
the way I feel about Arlong,

279
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,880
but until I went to Sabaody
Archipelago 2 years ago,

280
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,340
I never knew that such tough
Fish-Men were persecuted by humans.

281
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,850
When Camie was kidnapped
and I was going after her,

282
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,930
I couldn't believe what I saw!

283
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,560
The Sabaody Park in front of me looked exactly
like the Arlong Park that Arlong built!

284
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,070
We were yearning for it.

285
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm not just saying this
to make you forgive me.

286
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,250
Nami! Arlong-san really didn't like humans!

287
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,630
He hated them.

288
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,170
We went too far.

289
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,390
But ever since we were kids,

290
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,850
we yearned for the world that humans live in.

291
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Me, Arlong-san...

292
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,690
Everybody...

293
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,810
But we hurt so many humans!

294
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,520
Hachi, don't push yourself!
I'm gonna prepare some medicine so lie down.

295
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,610
I heard that Fish-Men and Merfolk were
considered mere fish a long time ago.

296
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:48,490
But 200 years ago, the Ryugu Kingdom became
a member country of the World Government.

297
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,160
They established friendly
relations with humans

298
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,750
and the king was allowed to
participate in the World Summit.

299
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,510
Despite that,
humans kept disliking Fish-Men.

300
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,930
The worst time that I experienced was
the beginning of the Great Pirate Era.

301
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:14,560
I vividly remember the fear of seeing
human pirates running wild on the island.

302
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,980
I can't get it off of my mind!

303
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,530
The Fish-Man Island was
taken over by humans.

304
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,790
And then, the late,
good-old Whitebeard saved us.

305
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,090
He claimed the Fish-Man Island as his own

306
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,050
and peace returned to the island.

307
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,220
However, it didn't stop humans
from disliking Fish-Men.

308
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,230
I know that you people saw
it at Sabaody Archipelago.

309
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,650
The reality.

310
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,450
The funny thing is those who seize
power tend to be more afraid of change.

311
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,200
Even though the Government bridged
the gap between Fish-Men and humans

312
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,040
those who held the real power ended up being
much more bigoted than all the others!

313
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,340
The relationship between Fish-Men
and humans remained the same.

314
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:30,810
Then, two people rose up on the Fish-Man Island,
to change our hopeless history.

315
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,770
One was Queen Otohime.

316
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,570
She kept trying to tell the islanders
to live in harmony with humans.

317
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,530
She was Princess Shirahoshi's mother.

318
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:49,780
And the other is the hero who
freed the slaves - Fisher Tiger.

319
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,540
Something Tiger... I heard that name before.

320
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,880
Calling for parting ways with humans,
he broke an unspoken rule

321
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,380
and invaded the Holyland of Marie
Jois by himself and freed the slaves.

322
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:13,350
Later, he formed the Sun Pirates
with the Fish-Men who were slaves.

323
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,270
The Sun...?

324
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,690
Yes! Me, Arlong, and Hachi joined the...

325
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,900
...crew of the Sun Pirates, naturally.

326
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:35,410
However, having the "Fish-Man Pirates"
who went against the Government...

327
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:44,250
...made it harder for Queen Otohime to
establish good relations with humans.

328
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,800
Queen Otohime was trying to weather
great hardships and change the future.

329
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,220
Fisher Tiger threw his future away

330
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,930
to save the slaves of his race
who were suffering at the time.

331
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,730
No one can say which one was right or wrong.

332
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,360
Let's talk.

333
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,820
They fought for the future
of Fish-Men and humans.

334
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,120
They were two monumental figures!

335
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,660
But what was their hidden angst?!

336
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,420
Queen Otohime tried to
guide the Ryugu Kingdom

337
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,170
toward a future where humans and
Fish-Men could live together.

338
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,400
There was also Fisher Tiger,
a hero who rescued Fish-Man

339
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,180
from enslavement by humans.

340
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,770
Their fates intertwined as they imagined
a new future for Fish-Man Island,

341
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,100
and an incident that shaped history occurred!

342
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

343
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,770
"A Hero Who Freed the Slaves!
An Adventurer Tiger!"

344
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
