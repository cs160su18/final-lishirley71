00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,100
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,970
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,060
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,660
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:19,310
"Yuba"              "Nanohana"   "Katorea"

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,270
Three years have passed since
a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,510
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,410
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people took up weapons.

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,810
The burning land is now
enveloped by a sad bellowing

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,660
and a mighty swell.

27
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,750
In the Alabasta port town of Nanohana,

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,460
Luffy reunited with his
older brother, Ace.

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,630
Ace demonstrates the power
of the Flame-Flame Fruit.

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,490
With Ace by their side,

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,200
the party follows the Sandora
River upstream toward Yuba.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,290
"Erumalu, the City of Green,
and the Kung Fu Dugongs!"

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,990
--Halt!
--What business do you have here?!

34
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,210
Please! Let us see the king!

35
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,300
How long is this civil war
going to keep up?!

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,030
With this civil war and drought,
we have nothing left to eat!

37
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,800
Please help my child!
There's no milk left!

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,330
Stop! Quit pushing!

39
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,800
We can't let you through!

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,150
--Let us speak with the king!
--You want us to just die, then?!

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,150
--Hey! Say somethin', will ya?!
--Are you just gonna abandon us?!

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,840
And you call yourself a king?!

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,380
Why, you! Don't you dare
insult His Royal Highness!

44
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,500
Cease that at once, guards!

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,730
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,300
My lack of strength has put you
through such unbearable suffering.

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,450
Those who wish to speak,
please come inside

48
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,100
and tell me of your qualms.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,560
All I can do now is share your
suffering as if it were my own as well.

50
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,900
I ask that you endure a little more.
I will return calm to this kingdom.

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,460
Even at the expense of my life!

52
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,540
Father! Someone set this up!

53
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,820
It's clear that someone is trying
to throw this kingdom into ruin!

54
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,260
I hope you're all right...

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,630
Where are you now,
and what are you doing, Vivi?

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,910
Tea's ready. Come on up to the kitchen.

57
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,690
Thank you, Sanji-san!

58
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,200
Heya! I'm Captain Rice Ball Usopp!

59
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,030
Oh! And who are you?!

60
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,410
I'm a riceman!

61
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,170
Quit playing with our food!

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,410
If you got free time,
go wash dishes or something!

63
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,250
Geez! I need to finish our packed
meals before we cross the river!

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,710
Need a hand?

65
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,300
No, no. You are a guest on board.
Just sit back and relax.

66
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,260
All right.

67
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,850
Don't wash the dishes
in that mop bucket!

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,060
What a nice breeze!

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Nami-san. I'd like to land
the ship here for a moment...

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,150
Eh? What for?

71
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,830
I have an important task for Karoo.

72
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,830
Karoo?

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,250
Karoo. I want you to go to
Alubarna Palace on your own

74
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
and deliver this letter to my father.

75
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,740
I've written down everything
Igaram and I learned

76
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,770
about Crocodile and
Baroque Works' schemes.

77
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,400
And that I've returned to Alabasta
alive with supportive friends.

78
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,990
Can you do it? You'll have to
cross the desert on your own.

79
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,070
Listen. You have to drink your
water with care in the desert.

80
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,420
Karoo! Good luck!

81
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,420
Now let my father know
this kingdom can be saved!

82
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,490
Drink your water with care!

83
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,860
Karoo... Thank you...

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,650
I knew Crocodile, one of the Seven
Warlords, was in this country...

85
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,990
But a pirate trying to steal a kingdom?
That sounds like a bad joke.

86
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,100
A pirate dropping anchor in
one spot and settling down?

87
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,210
Don't tell me he's trying
to usurp the throne.

88
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,960
Alright! Let's set sail!

89
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,150
Hold on! I'm not on board yet!

90
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,460
There could be another side
to this takeover thing.

91
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,920
Another side?

92
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,650
Some sort of deeper goal...

93
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,940
Alabasta, the kingdom of sand...

94
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,560
Even if you build cities
atop the sandy earth

95
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,670
and exist there for
thousands of years,

96
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,860
the desert will always be
filled with the stench of death.

97
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,530
From its very inception, this land
has embraced the shadow of death.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,540
I've just received word that the
Billions' ships stationed in Nanohana

99
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,360
have all been wiped out by someone...

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,460
I'm having this verified as we speak.

101
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,250
There are more replacements for
the Billions than we even need.

102
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,040
A single drop of water spilled in the
desert is no obstacle for my plan.

103
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,310
But, if anyone who would
dare defy me has appeared...

104
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,430
crush them.

105
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,500
Understood.

106
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,940
I've already sent the Lizard
Runners to contact the others.

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,700
Excellent.

108
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,670
We're finally here!

109
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,730
We're finally going into the desert!
I bet it'll be hot...

110
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,700
--It gets over 50 C in the daytime!
--Eh?! It does?!

111
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,590
What happened, Nami-san?!
Where did your dancer outfit go?!

112
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,440
Aah! Not you too, Vivi-chan!
Why are you dressed like that?!

113
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,020
In the desert, any exposed skin
will wind up terribly sunburned!

114
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,730
This is terrible... My dancer girls...

115
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,360
Put this on, Luffy-san.

116
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,780
Okay! Thank you!

117
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,000
--Let's get ready to disembark.
--Yeah.

118
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,870
Okay! Let's land!

119
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,920
What's that?

120
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,240
--Turtles?
--Aren't those seals?

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,470
Kung Fu Dugongs!

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,340
"If you wanna come on shore,
you'll have to beat me first!"

123
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,640
"Or else go back to
the other shore, cowards!"

124
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,000
Is what he says.

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,360
I can't sit quietly by when
someone calls me a coward!

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,880
--Let's do it!
--Wait! Usopp-san!

127
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,730
Kung Fu Dugongs are strong!

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,790
--One is winning over there!
--Winning is bad, too!

129
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,500
Huh?

130
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,760
It's a Kung Fu Dugong rule

131
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,680
that if someone loses,
they become the winner's pupil!

132
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,840
That's very martial arts-ish.

133
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,510
The number of pupils just went up!

134
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,830
Alright, everyone! After me!

135
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,520
Stance!

136
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,020
No! Like this!

137
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,730
Yeah! Now go like this!

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,020
That's it! Like this!

139
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,150
Like this! Like this!

140
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,030
Like this!

141
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,800
Alright! Let's set out for Yuba!

142
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,260
Hold on, now!

143
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,220
Are you bringing them with us?!

144
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,110
You can't, Luffy!

145
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,220
The Dugongs can't cross the desert...

146
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
So cute...

147
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,300
I don't know why, but I feel like
we're doing something very sad...

148
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,900
Me, too. What should we do?

149
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,070
I know!

150
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's see here...

151
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
What're you doing?

152
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,740
Here!

153
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,450
You can have this! So stay here, okay?

154
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,750
--Help!
--Chopper!

155
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,260
See ya!

156
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,260
Hey now, Luffy! Do you understand
the current situation?!

157
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,700
They said they were coming with me,
so why couldn't we let them?

158
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,390
We couldn't go to any city with
that big of a group! You're so dumb!

159
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,560
Honestly!

160
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,520
We would've been in big trouble
had Chopper not persuaded them!

161
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,800
Yeah! They kept saying,
"We'll accompany you!"

162
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,900
They really would've come if
we hadn't given them food!

163
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,870
Sheesh! Thanks to you, our food
supply's gotten a lot smaller!

164
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,830
--He knows how to cause trouble.
--That's for sure!

165
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,470
--What's this?
--Is this the town of Yuba?

166
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,620
No...

167
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,390
This is Erumalu. It used to be
known as the City of Green...

168
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,060
City of Green?

169
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,320
The sight of this town
explains everything.

170
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,820
What the Baroque Works organization
has done to this country...

171
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,320
What the people of Alabasta
are going through...

172
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,040
Wow! There's nothing here at all!

173
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,110
Yes. It's a ghost town now,

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,710
but up until just recently, it was
a thriving city full of greenery!

175
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,250
This place was?

176
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,750
Rain was always scarce, but even so,
the city was able to manage

177
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,100
by saving every last drop
of rainwater it could.

178
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,720
But, for three years now,

179
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,940
not a single drop of rain has
fallen in any part of this country.

180
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,150
--For three years?!
--That long?!

181
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,050
But even without rain, what
about the river we just crossed?

182
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah! Couldn't they just pipe
water in from that big river?

183
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
The answer to that is up ahead.

184
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,970
Never in the thousands of
years of Alabasta's history

185
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,610
has the rain stopped completely.

186
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,930
But, there was one place where
the rain fell more than usual...

187
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,280
Alubarna, the capital.
The city with the king's palace...

188
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,470
The people called it
the King's Miracle.

189
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,130
Until what happened
that day, at least...

190
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,200
Lower the cargo!

191
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,850
It's falling over!

192
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,020
Look out!

193
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,350
Hey! Are you alright?!

194
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh, no! This is bad!

195
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,650
We were supposed to deliver
this to King Cobra in Alubarna!

196
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,590
What is this green powder?

197
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,700
What is it?

198
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,830
H-How should we know?!
We're only following your king's orders!

199
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,100
--Right?
--We're just couriers!

200
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,330
Run!

201
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,040
Wait... Could this be?!

202
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,060
Dance Powder?!

203
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,040
You've heard of it?

204
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,800
Yes. It's also known as
"Rain-Summoning Powder."

205
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,250
Rain-summoning?

206
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,260
I'd only heard stories about it,

207
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,920
but a researcher in a country
where it doesn't rain created it.

208
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,940
By creating a misty smoke from it
and letting it rise into the sky,

209
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,030
you can artificially cause it to rain.

210
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,380
That's what Dance Powder is.

211
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,900
Oh! I get it!

212
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,550
You mean that mystery powder!

213
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,810
I ate some a while back!
It tastes really bad!

214
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,950
It isn't food.

215
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,130
It's for making rain.

216
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,680
What?! You think I'm lying,
don't you?! Hey, you!

217
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,340
Hold on! Wouldn't something like
that be perfect for this country?

218
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,360
As the name suggests, the country
that developed Dance Powder

219
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,930
was almost happy enough
to dance at first.

220
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,940
But there was a big catch:

221
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,630
the neighboring country had a drought.

222
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,700
Understand?

223
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,270
Dance Powder quickly and
artificially matures clouds

224
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,500
that would normally grow into
rain clouds further downwind

225
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,560
and causes them to rain.

226
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,250
So...

227
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, I get it!

228
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,960
It steals rain that would've normally
gone to a neighboring country!

229
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,080
Eventually, war broke out
between the two countries

230
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,800
and many lives were lost as a result.

231
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,970
Ever since, the World Government
has put a worldwide ban

232
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,200
on the production and
possession of Dance Powder.

233
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,720
Powder that can bring both
happiness and dread when used...

234
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,050
When all that Dance Powder was
brought into the port town,

235
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,080
Alabasta was in the middle of
a strange weather phenomenon

236
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,150
where rain fell nowhere but in
the town where the king lived.

237
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,760
We haven't had a single drop of rain

238
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,500
because the king's been
using Dance Powder!

239
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,850
Alubarna's rain wasn't a miracle at all!

240
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,400
It's all because of the king
that we're parched and starving!

241
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,500
Hold on, Vivi! That means
your dad is the bad guy here!

242
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,920
You idiot! He was framed!

243
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,360
Vivi-chan's father would
never do any such thing!

244
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,250
Never... Never...

245
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,640
Of course, my father had
nothing to do with it,

246
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
but at around the same time,

247
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,400
a massive amount of Dance Powder
was found inside the palace...

248
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,320
They even had people
working inside the palace?

249
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,660
What's this road, Vivi-chan?

250
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,410
This was a canal that used to bring
water in from the Sandora River.

251
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,370
Someone destroyed this canal, too...

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,570
With its canal gone, the City of Green
could no longer secure water.

253
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,550
As if praying, the people continued
to wait, but rain never came.

254
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,770
Ever since the Dance Powder incident,
distrust in the king grows daily.

255
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,020
And it's all how Crocodile planned, huh?

256
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,480
And then the fighting finally began.

257
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,440
To escape the fighting, the
exhausted people abandoned the city

258
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,940
and left for other oases
in search of water.

259
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,330
And then...

260
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
the City of Green withered away.

261
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,350
--Huh? Is that someone's voice?!
--Is it the rebel army?!

262
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,230
Don't tell me Baroque Works
has been following us!

263
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,240
--No. It's just wind.
--It has to be someone's voice!

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,660
It's coming from all directions!
What do we do, Big Brother?!

265
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,310
There's no danger.

266
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,480
It's just wind blowing across the
town and echoing off old buildings.

267
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,090
It's as if...

268
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,220
It's as if the city of
Erumalu is crying...

269
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,160
Here it comes!

270
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,010
Whoa, what was with that wind?

271
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Someone's collapsed!

272
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,050
There are still people in this city?!

273
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
What did my father...

274
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,600
What did the citizens
of this country ever do?

275
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,860
These people have worked
so hard to live,

276
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,790
being natives of a desert land who
are forced to fight with nature.

277
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,510
Yet he's destroyed their lives!

278
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,000
What gives him the right to do that?!

279
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,100
What?!

280
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,140
All the while,
as one of the Seven Warlords,

281
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,840
he pretends to be a hero of the people!

282
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,890
No one realizes he's
deceiving the entire country!

283
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,560
Crocodile! Crocodile! Crocodile!

284
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,770
I...

285
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
can't let him get away with this!

286
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,370
Geez, you're all such kids.

287
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,220
Vivi!

288
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,180
Let's get moving!

289
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,350
I'm itching to do this now!

290
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,870
Let's go to Yuba!

291
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,020
That's where the rebel army is, right?

292
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,180
Yes. I'm going to persuade their
leader to stop the rebellion.

293
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,150
Persuade?

294
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,220
All of Alabasta's calamities
are Crocodile's doing!

295
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm going to tell him the truth

296
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,800
and have him stop the
pointless shedding of blood!

297
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,040
Got it.

298
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,020
Like the adventurers
I dreamed of when I was a child

299
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,070
I continue on to the ends of emotion

300
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,170
I scoop up my hands,

301
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,710
and the sand and time
that spills from them

302
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,670
show me that this is
what I was born to do

303
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:56,700
Let's continue swimming
at a near-tumbling speed

304
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:08,570
Until we wash up someday
on a white sandy beach

305
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,460
no one knows about

306
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,900
I can't go on...
I can't take hot weather...

307
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,170
Then take off that animal suit.

308
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,610
You jerk! Are you making
fun of reindeer?!

309
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,060
Hey. What in the world is Luffy doing?

310
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,180
--He's riding a camel!
--Wait! Something's chasing him!

311
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,640
Ugh! How is he able to
summon trouble like this?!

312
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,230
On the next episode of One Piece!

313
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,020
"Adventure in the Country of Sand! The
Monsters that Live in the Scorching Land"

314
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
