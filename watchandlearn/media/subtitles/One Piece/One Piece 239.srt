2
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,580
These guys are really strong...

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,380
Dammit! What's with you guys?!
Tell me the reason at least!

4
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,170
We're the ones who'd like to know why.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,300
The culprits who attacked
Iceberg-san last night were...

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,260
...from your gang, weren't they?!

7
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,450
Iceberg was attacked?
What're you talking about?

8
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,710
Wh-What did they mean?

9
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,050
D... Don't be ridiculous! Why...
Why would we do such a thing?!

10
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,050
So you'd play innocent to the end, huh?

11
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,220
But we really didn't...

12
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,970
The culprits...

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,360
When Iceberg-san came around, he told
us that he remembered the two culprits.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,900
One was a big man with a mask on.

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,030
The other was a tall woman.

16
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,990
When we asked the government,
they said that she's one of you guys...

17
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,830
Nico Robin, the woman
with a bounty on her head!

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,290
Robin?!

19
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,130
Did you come to this island in order
to kill Iceberg-san from the start?

20
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,560
Or did you decide to do so after
you guys met him yesterday?

21
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,020
I don't know what you pirates think...

22
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,440
...but now that we've come to know you're
the culprits, we won't leave you at large.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,980
So he's one of the culprits?

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,570
We can't forgive him!
We definitely can't forgive him!

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,610
Oh, no...!

26
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,530
Hey, hey, so did Iceberg die?

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,740
Heaven forbid that he'd
get killed by fools like them!

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,460
Precisely because he's still alive,
this guy could go after his life again.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
So we'll take care of him right here, right now.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,090
Dead or alive...

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
They don't care if you're captured alive or not.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,060
Do you know what it means
to be on the wanted list?

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,600
You pirates can't complain,
no matter who does what to you.

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,270
In other words, the world's
laws won't protect you guys.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,570
That's right.

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,820
We are outlaws.

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,530
I know that. But...

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,500
...don't say things like that when
you know nothing about Robin!

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,220
It's all right! Now let's move forward

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,760
with the sun always in our hearts

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,060
As power passes through our clasped hands

42
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,730
let's grab hold of our wishes

43
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:44,740
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

44
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:52,040
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,000
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,140
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

47
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,520
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

48
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,480
but what you cherish most will be right there

49
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,480
And if you get into a jam

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,530
I'll always be there to protect you

51
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,700
It's all right! Now let's move forward

52
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,240
with the sun always in our hearts

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,250
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,540
and gaze at the light beyond

55
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,460
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

56
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,760
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,720
So let's grab hold of our wishes

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,470
under the same flag-- together, we're one

59
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,140
One Piece

60
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:10,030
"The Straw Hat Pirates Are the Culprits?
The Protectors of the City of Water"

61
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,740
Luffy...

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,790
Let me see Ice pops!

63
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,710
I'm sure he was mistaken!
There's no way it was Robin!

64
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,420
Why would we let you get closer
when we don't know what you'd do?!

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,380
He's right! Tie up the culprits!

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,260
They tried to kill our town's hero!

67
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,760
Send them to the gallows!

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,140
H-Hey! What're you saying?!

69
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,480
You bitch!

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,560
Hey! You were with that Straw
Hat guy earlier, weren't you?

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
You must be one of them, too!

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,570
Is that right?!

73
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,360
Yeah, he's right! I saw her, too!

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,200
We're not gonna let you get away!

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,160
Don't fight!

76
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,490
Hey! Stop it!

77
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,160
Nami!

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,880
Let go of me! I said let go
of me! What did we do?!

79
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,540
Don't play innocent! You bastards are assassins!

80
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,710
How dare you shoot Iceberg-san?!
We won't let you get away!

81
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,970
Hey! Stop it, you guys!
We're saying we didn't do anything!

82
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,720
That's right!

83
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,560
First off, Robin doesn't have a reason
to go after Iceberg-san, either!

84
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,650
Just keep insisting that.

85
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,570
In any case, this is it for you two.

86
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,490
Learn that harming Iceberg-san

87
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,610
means that you're turning us,
Galley-La Company, into an enemy...

88
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,200
That you're turning this city,
Water Seven, into an enemy.

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,080
Why are you saying
groundless things like that?!

90
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Let me talk to Ice pops!

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,420
Just give up, pirate!

92
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,630
The information will spread
throughout this town immediately.

93
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,340
There's no longer a place for you to escape!

94
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,640
We'll bring down everyone in your gang!

95
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,100
Beat him up, Galley-La Company!

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,750
What's the matter, Straw Hat?!

97
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,330
You've only been defending.
Don't you wanna fight back?!

98
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,170
Like I said, I don't have any reason to fight you!

99
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,180
We now know that pistols don't work on you.

100
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,060
Dammit. Looks like they're
all serious about this.

101
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,030
It was a direct hit!

102
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,400
No... He got away.

103
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,160
That was close...

104
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,650
Shoot! I can't move!

105
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,910
--Luffy!
--All right! They got him!

106
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,170
Yay! Just as you'd expect from our
pride and joy, Galley-La Company! Yay!

107
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,300
That feels great!

108
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,850
Right. A guy like that should be blown away!

109
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,140
Well, well, well...

110
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,820
But, you know, that Straw Hat shorty
is the Franky Family's detestable enemy.

111
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,360
I was the one who was fighting him first.

112
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,290
Don't you come and snatch
my prey when I'm fighting!

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,580
Just how many times do I have
to repeat myself, you bastards?!

114
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,750
Galley-Laaa!!

115
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,050
Just hold on a sec. We'll deal with
you after we capture him completely.

116
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,430
Like I said... why in the hell
are you capturing my prey?!

117
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,480
Well, never mind. Seems like you
guys don't get what I'm saying.

118
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,270
Paulie! Watch out!

119
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,770
Galley-La! Run!

120
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,150
Franky is gonna launch a crazy attack!

121
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,940
Hm?

122
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,950
Connecter set...

123
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,330
He brought down a huge crane
earlier with the same attack!

124
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,880
Brought down a crane?

125
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
A cannon?

126
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,840
Run! Galley-La!

127
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Go! Get them, Bro!

128
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,300
Well, I'm not gonna shoot a cannonball.

129
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,140
What I'll shoot out is an air bullet.

130
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,440
But its speed exceeds the speed of sound.

131
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,520
Air?

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,730
It's dangerous! Run!

133
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,160
What the hell?

134
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,380
Coup de Vent!

135
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Ow... What the hell was that?!

136
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,010
It felt like high-pressure winds crashed into us!

137
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,590
Another crane is coming down!

138
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,970
Run! It'll reach this far!

139
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,440
Hurry up!

140
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,390
It's coming down!

141
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,980
Yeah! Get crushed!

142
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,530
A shipyard like this should be... crushed!

143
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,050
What is he?! A cyborg? Where did
he get that kind of technology?

144
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,850
And what was that weird cannon?!

145
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,600
Ah... but...

146
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,770
I was able to escape thanks to that.

147
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,270
Nami! Run!

148
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,060
Luffy!

149
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,270
Are you okay?

150
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,530
No way I'd get brought down
by something like that!

151
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,240
Anyway, I don't get it.

152
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
Let's go see Ice pops somehow!

153
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,580
What?! We're going?! It's not
possible in this commotion!

154
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,290
Hey, look! Straw Hat is getting away!

155
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,540
Oh, shoot!

156
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,960
We're gonna be surrounded!

157
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,590
--Nami!
--Hm?

158
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,300
Hold on tight!

159
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,140
Hey, wait!

160
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,260
Don't let them get away!

161
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,020
--They got away!
--Go after them!

162
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,020
I don't see him.

163
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,350
Yeah... Maybe he still can't move...

164
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,940
But it wouldn't be good if
we go closer and he finds us.

165
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,780
Yeah...

166
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,950
Chopper, are you ready?

167
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,950
Yep.

168
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,540
Hey! I heard that a storm surge
called Aqua Laguna is approaching!!

169
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,380
Yep! This town will be
submerged by midnight tonight!!

170
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
This shore will be totally submerged, too!!

171
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,050
That's terrible!! We shouldn't
stay around here!!

172
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,680
That's right! We shouldn't stay around here!!

173
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,760
We'd better hurry up and
evacuate to high ground!!

174
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,390
That's right!! Let's hurry up and evacuate!!

175
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,350
--Evacuate!! Evacuate!!
--Evacuate!! Evacuate!!

176
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,730
Evacuate!! Evacuate!!

177
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,920
Run!

178
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,300
What were those voices just now...?

179
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,430
Make sure you evacuate!

180
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,230
Evacuate, Usopp!

181
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,440
They were saying something
about a storm surge.

182
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,820
Come to think of it... the wind is awfully strong.

183
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,660
Bro?

184
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,160
Hm?

185
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,080
They got away. Don't you
have to go after them?

186
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,380
No... I ran out fuel with the
Coupe de Vent I just shot.

187
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,000
Look at my ducktail.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,420
Yeah... It looks like a
willow swaying in the wind.

189
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,890
Those damn bastards got in my way.

190
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,470
Once I'm done refueling,
I'll eliminate him for sure.

191
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,400
Just as you'd expect from a man with
a 100 million bounty on his head...

192
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,150
He sure is a man of mettle.

193
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,360
Seriously...

194
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,910
Franky has really done it...

195
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,330
What a terrible day today is!

196
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,830
At any rate, we can't let them get away.

197
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,880
Aqua Laguna is coming tonight.

198
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,170
Except for the two sea train
departures left today,

199
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,630
they have no means to leave this island...

200
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,630
...since they can no longer
use the ship they came on.

201
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,760
We'll gather information.

202
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,730
Have every Galley-La craftsman
spread around the island.

203
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,640
We're gonna settle this before sunset!

204
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,490
Grandma! Grandma! It's Water Seven!

205
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,580
Be careful not to get too
excited and fall into the sea.

206
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,810
That must be the Galley-La
Company's main office.

207
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,350
It's connected to Dock #1.

208
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,430
Look.

209
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,230
People who look like reporters are all over.

210
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,190
Shipwright-looking people
are gathered there, too.

211
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,780
Iceberg-san must be in that building.

212
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,950
Are you serious about going?

213
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,410
Of course.

214
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,580
I'll go ask Ice pops in person why
he said Robin was one of the culprits.

215
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me warn you.

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,220
Just remember that we're also being
chased after by the entire island!

217
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Make sure you get some idea
where his room is beforehand,

218
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,430
and seize an opportunity to carefully sneak in.

219
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,020
Well then, I'm off.

220
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,230
Huh?

221
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,690
--Hey!
--They said they couldn't find them.

222
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,610
Who's that?!

223
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,320
Ah... He is...!

224
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,120
The window got broken!

225
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,420
What happened?!

226
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,040
An attack!

227
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,170
Straw Hat Luffy has broken into the main office!

228
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,390
What?! In the middle of the day?!

229
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,300
To think that he attacks the
main office again out of the blue!

230
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,350
Where is he?!

231
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,810
He went to the mezzanine
stairs to the third floor!

232
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,770
--Where are the foremen?!
--They're stationing craftsmen all
over the island, so they're all gone!

233
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,940
He's wearing a red vest and a straw hat!

234
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,280
Protect Iceberg-san!

235
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,280
It's Straw Hat!

236
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,700
Where did he go?!

237
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,080
Where is he? Where is he?

238
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,880
Idiot! Don't shoot a pistol!
We're inside, remember?

239
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,300
It's not good for Iceberg-san!

240
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,350
I'm sorry about the
commotion outside the room.

241
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,850
Well... what's going on?

242
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,190
I was told that Straw Hat Luffy
has broken into this building.

243
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,160
Kalifa... I have a favor to ask.

244
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,450
--There he is!
--Dammit!

245
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,120
Whoa! So many of them!

246
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,080
He's going to Building #2!
Go around from upstairs!

247
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,470
Straw Hat!

248
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,430
She is...

249
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,940
Kalifa-san, didn't a pirate come here?

250
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,770
No, he didn't. More importantly,
chase after him more quietly.

251
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,570
Iceberg-san still needs to rest quietly.

252
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,780
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,740
Looks like the Straw Hat
hasn't reached this far yet.

254
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,860
Let's stand watch around here.

255
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,580
His target is definitely this room!

256
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,140
Well... you wanted to see me...
right, pirate lad?

257
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,980
That's right. Thanks for
calling me in. That saved me.

258
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,190
I doubt you came all the way here by
yourself to kill me in this commotion.

259
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,490
I came to hear the truth!

260
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,320
Last night, I saw Nico Robin with my own eyes.

261
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,080
And... she is one of you.

262
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,750
That's the truth.

263
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,750
Was it really Robin?!

264
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,540
Don't say a word.

265
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,300
Your words no longer mean anything.

266
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,560
I called you in here...

267
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,640
...because I have a favor to ask.

268
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,690
Let me see Nico Robin again now!

269
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,940
Extra! Extra!

270
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,660
The culprits for Mr. Iceberg's
attack were the Straw Hat pirates!

271
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:53,620
We, Water-Water Newspaper, will buy
any information on their sightings!

272
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,290
The culprits are on this island!

273
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,210
Find the Straw Hats and send
them all to the gallows!

274
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,130
Yeah!

275
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,110
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

276
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Chasing after something constant

277
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,240
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

278
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Even when we're exhausted

279
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,710
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

280
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,130
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

281
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,050
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

282
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,010
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

283
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,800
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

284
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Eternally... Eternally...

285
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,680
Wild fantasies from our childhood

286
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,520
We trace unforgettable memories

287
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,190
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

288
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,030
To this familiar sunny sky

289
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,820
Together we entrust our feelings

290
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,410
We go beyond the changing time

291
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,040
Eternally... Eternally...

292
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,090
It's gotta be a mistake that
Robin is the assassin, right?

293
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,840
I wonder where she went.

294
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Craftsmen are everywhere on the island.

295
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,760
We have to find her soon.

296
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,220
They say that a crazy storm is approaching, too.

297
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,720
What're we gonna do?

298
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,890
Maybe Robin really betrayed--

299
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,560
No! I don't believe it!

300
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,890
On the next episode of One Piece!

301
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,520
"Eternal Farewell? Nico Robin,
the Woman Who Draws Darkness"

302
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
