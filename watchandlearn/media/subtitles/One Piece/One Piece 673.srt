The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake
up! Wake up heart beat!

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070
Freedom is our only compass,

We will keep making our own route

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,980
Running at full speed

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,150

We are the one! Go ahead!

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,800
Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,480
Everytime we overcome something,

burning, intense excitement!

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,680
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,730
Luffy and the others formed a pirate
alliance with Trafalgar Law

75
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,760
and have come to Dressrosa.

76
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,630
Luffy entered a fighting competition - in
which a winner will get the Flare-Flare Fruit

77
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,640
as the prize - and won the first round

78
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,610
but now, he's heading for the palace
to take back Law who's

79
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,140
been captured by Doflamingo.

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,710
Leo! Leo!

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,690
Stay with me! That was too reckless!

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,330
We must complete Operation SOP...

83
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,580
...as soon as...

84
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,690
...possible.

85
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,360
Then, the commander will...

86
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,700
...take down Doflamingo...

87
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,170
...for sure!

88
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,740
Rebecca, do you know
how your mother Scarlet died?

89
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,240
The Toy Soldier cried like a baby.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,390
He was so pathetic.

91
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,940
You can't go after him!

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Are you okay, Commander?!

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,430
Th-Thank you!

94
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,230
--Let's get going!
--Wait! They're gonna get beaten up!

95
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey! Let go of me! You little bastards!

96
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,320
Stop looking back, Commander!

97
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,390
We were planning on
sacrificing ourselves from the beginning!

98
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,510
Don't be silly!

99
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,840
What will happen if you stop here?!

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Even if
Leo and the others pulled off Operation SOP,

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,690
if we let Doflamingo walk away,
he'll turn everything back again!

102
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
You're the only one who can bring
down Doflamingo, Commander!

103
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,400
He's worth betting everything on!

104
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,580
Nobody remembers him now

105
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,230
but everybody knew him once!

106
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,030
When he was a Big Human, his name was...

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,010
...Kyros!

108
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,500
He was the strongest gladiator
in the history of the Colosseum!

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,590
That's who our commander is!

110
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,760
"The Rupture Human!
Gladius Blows Up Big Time!"

111
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,660
THE ROYAL PALACE B-1 - THE RAMPART TOWER

112
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,810
That didn't make a dent, did it?

113
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,960
I can't see an end to this!

114
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,270
How and where do I have to attack
to finish him off?!

115
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,690
THE ROYAL PALACE 1ST FLOOR
THE SOLDIER AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE

116
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,260
Break him down!

117
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,170
Don't get in my way!

118
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,990
Rampo!

119
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,830
--Are you okay, Rampo?!
--Commander!

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,420
You alright?!

121
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,020
No worries! It's nothing!

122
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,100
Once they pull off Operation SOP,

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,000
you can change back to being a great gladiator!

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,690
But we're responsible to help you
to reach Doflamingo before that!

125
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,410
You guys...

126
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,730
Don't tell me that's...

127
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,970
Commander!
There's another executive!

128
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,770
He's a member of the Pica Army!

129
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,530
Gladius!

130
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,740
You have no chance of winning now!

131
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,670
Rampo and I are gonna draw his attention!

132
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,070
So please run ahead!

133
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,160
No, don't!

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,700
Are you guys gonna try to
sacrifice yourselves again?!

135
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,670
Rampo!

136
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,310
Let's attack him from both sides, Cub-san!

137
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,400
Okay!

138
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,820
Wait!

139
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,690
Why should I fight these little rats?!

140
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,910
Take this!

141
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,040
Your buzzing around is annoying me!

142
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,790
Cub!

143
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,060
Rampo!

144
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,640
--Commander!
--Now is your chance!

145
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,450
Toys can't run that fast!

146
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,800
I ate the Pop-Pop Fruit
and became a rupture human!

147
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,600
I can detonate my own body.

148
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,010
And...

149
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,020
What?!

150
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,550
...Inorganic objects as well.

151
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,020
I can destroy a thing like
a tin toy completely!

152
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,530
L-Let go of me!

153
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,360
I have a...

154
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,300
...responsibility!

155
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,980
Rebecca!

156
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,380
Enjoy being blown to pieces!

157
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,550
Jet Stamp!

158
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,420
Who is it?!

159
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,420
--Soldier! Where are Franky and the others?
--You're...

160
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,950
Oh, you aren't with them?

161
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,600
Straw Hat! This is no time to talk!

162
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,350
Straw Hat Luffy!

163
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,590
Violet!

164
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,940
Gladius!

165
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,960
How could you...

166
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,880
How could you betray Young Master-sama!

167
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,580
--Alright! Bring it on!
--No! You have to run!

168
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,720
What're you doing?!

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,420
We don't have time!
And he's pretty strong, too!

170
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,870
Let's just go to the Suit Chamber now!

171
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,260
Viola-sama, why are you doing this?!

172
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,760
You know who I am?

173
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,260
I do! Even if you don't remember me!

174
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,290
I've been watching over you
with my Clairvoyance, too!

175
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,260
You and Rebecca!

176
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,950
What?

177
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,440
It must've been hard! Thank you!

178
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,000
Violet!

179
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,420
I will never let a traitor walk away...

180
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,550
...alive!

181
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,200
I didn't betray anybody!
Since that day a decade ago,

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,630
I've never trusted you guys,
not even once!

183
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,600
Either way, it's disrespectful
to the Young Master!

184
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,870
Helmet Pop!

185
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,650
Viola-sama!

186
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,680
Oh no!

187
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,090
It isn't a serious wound, is it?!
Sorry that I couldn't protect you!

188
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,760
It was just some shrapnel grazing by!
Let's make our way up!

189
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,890
How we go up doesn't matter, right?!

190
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,960
Wait a second!
The staircase is not that way...

191
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
--What?!
--What're you up to?!

192
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,620
That must be it!

193
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,420
Where did they go?!

194
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,590
Young Master?

195
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,390
Why're you here?

196
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,990
DON QUIXOTE DOFLAEMON
KIN'EMON IN DISGUISE

197
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,780
Hm? Young Master?

198
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,000
Who is Young Master? I'm Don Quixote...

199
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,440
That's how they address Doflamingo!

200
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
I am the Young Master.

201
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,460
There are some intruders in the palace.

202
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,290
Please wait upstairs until we wipe them out.

203
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,120
No, I can't do that...

204
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,770
I mean, I'll leave it up to you.

205
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,730
I'm gonna go down underground
to see how Kanjuro is doing.

206
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,340
Kanjuro?

207
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,100
The samurai who has disappeared
from the junkyard?

208
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,450
Indeed. I'm gonna go see Kanjuro
who has disappeared from the junkyard...

209
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,000
What?!

210
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,450
He disappeared?!

211
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,360
Boy! We made it straight to our destination!

212
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,340
THE SUIT CHAMBER

213
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
No, you'll have to wait!

214
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,150
Hey, why do we have to hide?!
Mingo is there!

215
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,540
Be quiet! Don't ruin their operation!

216
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,640
--What operation?
--The Tontattas' Operation SOP!

217
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,670
We can only make a move
after they pull it off.

218
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,000
So stay still for now!

219
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,890
I thought you guys wanted to destroy
the SMILE factory and that's it.

220
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,530
Then why are the Straw Hats working with
the Little People of Green Bit?

221
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,830
They're not acting on some casual whim.

222
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,000
The Little People?

223
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,570
How did they sneak into the basement?

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,350
Why do they wanna attack Sugar?

225
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,520
I don't know why but they keep doing things

226
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,360
that are causing me a lot of grief.

227
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,460
If it's not a coincidence, it means...

228
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,750
...they know what's behind
the darkness of this country!

229
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,790
Answer!

230
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,970
The Young Master is asking
you questions, Law!

231
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,270
Don't do it if it's gonna
make you cry-dasuyan!

232
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,950
You two never change!

233
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,310
I told you.

234
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,630
I have nothing to do with them anymore!

235
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,550
Our alliance ended.

236
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,190
I don't know what you're
talking about at all.

237
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,970
Are you trying to fool me?

238
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,010
Or do you really not know anything?

239
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,000
If Violet were with us,
she could tell what's in your mind easily.

240
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,460
Or...

241
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,100
...you didn't instigate them,
did you, King Riku?

242
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,970
The Tontattas once served you.

243
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,460
Father-sama?! Why is he here in the palace?!

244
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,750
Tra-guy seems alive.

245
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,540
King Riku!

246
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm glad you're okay after a decade!

247
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,630
Your name is Kyros, huh? Come with me!

248
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,760
I will save you at any cost!

249
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,870
Hey, let's kick Mingo's ass already!

250
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,570
I said wait!

251
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,060
What are Leo and the others doing?!

252
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,350
The moment that all the toys in Dressrosa
change back to humans will be...

253
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,730
...the one and only chance
to take down Doflamingo!

254
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,020
I will finish him off at any price!

255
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,090
I won't let
Cub and the others' effort go to waste!

256
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,530
I'm counting on you, Leo! Usoland!

257
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,340
THE RUINS OF THE "EXECUTIVE TOWER"
IN THE UNDERGROUND TRADE PORT

258
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,290
Leo! You...

259
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm not that hurt. It's nothing.

260
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,730
Everybody's trying their best!

261
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,630
To accomplish Operation SOP!

262
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,260
H-Hey!

263
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,870
Are you still going on with this?

264
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,250
Of course, I am!

265
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,180
If we can't knock Sugar out,

266
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,450
the commander and the Big Humans
who got turned into toys...

267
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,830
...can't change back!

268
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,610
Making Sugar eat this clump
of Tatababasco Sauce is...

269
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,660
...our responsibility!

270
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,500
These guys...!

271
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,980
Do you still want something?
How annoying.

272
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Not just to rescue our captive friends

273
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,880
but also to save the whole of Dressrosa

274
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,430
and restore the King Riku dynasty, we must...

275
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,940
...accomplish Operation SOP first!

276
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,350
Charge!

277
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,500
Don't bother!

278
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,580
Stand up, little bears!

279
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,630
I don't wanna do this!

280
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,470
--I don't wanna fight our friends!
--Somebody, help!

281
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,710
Now, go ahead and kill each other!

282
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,280
What are they doing?!

283
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,000
They did their best already!

284
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,240
They are... helpless fools!

285
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
I agree.

286
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,350
But I like them.

287
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,730
Robin?!

288
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,460
You're barely alive!

289
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,250
Doce Fleurs!

290
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,400
What's this?! What's this?!

291
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,770
What's this?! It's so creepy!

292
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,290
--Leo!
--Robiland!

293
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,810
Do it now!

294
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,940
Put the Tatababasco grape in her mouth!

295
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,180
Thank you!

296
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,920
He can make it!

297
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,910
That's it!

298
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,950
Leo!

299
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,830
What?! What happened?!

300
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I thought he was gonna make it!

301
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,890
Stop wasting your time!

302
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,120
There is no salvaging Operation SOP now!

303
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,560
Merciless Trebol torments and

304
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,220
squishes the Little People one after another!

305
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,260
But even though they hear their

306
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,980
friends screaming and crying,
the Tontattas keep their spirits high...

307
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,400
...believing in their last hope -
the legendary hero named Usoland!

308
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,940
On the next episode of One Piece!
A Liar! Usoland on the Run!

309
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,070
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
