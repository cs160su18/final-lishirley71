00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,990
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,900
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,130
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,030
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,550
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,960
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,270
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,280
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,410
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,500
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,930
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:14,410
"Rainbase"                 "Alubarna"
"Yuba" "Erumalu" "Nanohana" "Katorea"
"Spiders Café"

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,370
Three years have passed
since a single drop of rain fell

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,110
in the kingdom of oases.

24
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,480
Seeing hope beyond turmoil,
the people take up weapons.

25
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,700
Fanning the flames
of rebellion is Crocodile.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,530
To stop his scheme,

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,860
Luffy and company stormed
the enemy hideout in Rainbase,

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,580
but they wound up captured instead.

29
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,750
What is the operation Crocodile speaks of?

30
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,250
Will Vivi's wish be swallowed
up by the burning land?

31
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,590
It just turned noon.

32
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,700
The operation is beginning.

33
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,970
"Operation Utopia Commences!
The Swell of Rebellion Stirs"

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,410
Don't hold suspicion, Koza.

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,320
You know His Majesty's
character very well.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,820
All you old people say that.

37
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,830
I didn't follow you here to
Yuba for the king's sake.

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,770
The rebel army is over
100,000 strong now!

39
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,650
Yeah, I heard.

40
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,700
Apparently there've been casualties, too...

41
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,430
It's nothing.

42
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,080
Just a little rain will clear him
of these strange suspicions.

43
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,930
Yes.

44
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,770
What on earth?!

45
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,800
The canal's been destroyed!

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
Who would do this?!

47
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,200
Now we can't bring water to this town!

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,430
It hasn't rained for over a year now!

49
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,110
Erumalu is done for!

50
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,220
Don't hold suspicion, Koza...

51
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,450
I don't want to suspect you,
but people are dying of thirst!

52
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,880
You may not be using it,
but you do have it!

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,900
No. Wait for natural rain.

54
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,280
Dance Powder summons misfortune.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Just a little bit should be alright!

56
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,960
The rebellion might even stop
if there's at least some rain!

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,580
It would only result in a greater calamity.

58
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,860
It is not as easy to use as you think, Koza.

59
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,710
I can't stand to watch
towns dry up anymore!

60
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,920
You haven't changed a bit
since the old days.

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,690
I have changed.

62
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,060
I can fight.

63
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm going to...

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm going to come here to take your rain!

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
Where is this country headed?

66
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,780
Where are we headed?

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,450
Where does the answer lie?

68
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,680
I have bad news, Koza!

69
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,390
"Alubarna Palace"

70
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,640
T-Terrible news, Chaka-sama!

71
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,060
It's His Majesty!

72
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,020
What?! What are you saying?!

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,690
He vanished!

74
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,670
That's absurd!
Have you searched everywhere?!

75
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,490
Yes!

76
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,840
Not only the palace, but the
garden and storehouses as well!

77
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,970
Could he have left
in the middle of the night?

78
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,510
Out of the question!
The king's security was top-notch,

79
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,460
and he couldn't have escaped our eyes!

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,210
Then... Then, why?

81
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,410
Why would the king hide himself
just before going to battle?!

82
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,060
Search! Outside the palace and the towns!

83
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,720
Yes, sir!

84
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,690
Pell excels in finding people,
but as luck would have it,

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,890
he's busy conducting
reconnaissance in Rainbase...

86
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,880
What has happened to His Majesty?

87
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,810
I can't afford to act recklessly...

88
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,720
Damn it!

89
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,790
Just what are you planning
to do to Alabasta?!

90
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,390
Would you like to know the type of
people I look down on most of all?

91
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,560
Hypocrites who treasure the
so-called "happiness of the people."

92
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,700
You intend to kill my father?!

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,480
As if you could ever do that!

94
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,320
There's no need to shout.

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,950
I have no such intention.

96
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,870
He's not even worth killing.

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,830
I'm going to let Cobra taste
humiliation far crueler than death.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,580
Crueler than death?

99
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,830
That's no way for a princess
of a kingdom to look.

100
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,890
I'll ask one more time!

101
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,510
Just what is Operation Utopia?! Tell me!

102
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,820
Now, now. Do you realize where
you stand in this situation?

103
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,010
Answer the question!

104
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,600
You're a valiant princess.

105
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,080
But very well.
The operation has already begun.

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,890
I'll tell you about my plan
to end this country...

107
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,200
About Operation Utopia...

108
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Terrible news,
Chaka-sama! It's His Majesty!

109
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,200
What is it?! Did you find him?!

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,630
Yes, sir! He's apparently in Nanohana!

111
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,810
The information is certain!

112
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,360
I see! That's a relief!

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,080
But...

114
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,550
But, unbelievably enough...

115
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,800
C-Come again?!

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,550
--Koza!
--Koza-san!

117
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,970
--Wait!
--We're coming too!

118
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,310
Why suddenly now?!

119
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,220
Has he fallen as far as he can?!

120
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,690
Don't hold suspicion, Koza.

121
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,150
Why would he do something
this nonsensical?!

122
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,330
"Nanohana"

123
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,570
Y-Your Majesty?

124
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,320
What did you just say?

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,540
Just as you heard.
I am honestly apologizing.

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,750
It was I, Cobra, the king of Alabasta,
who stole this country's rain!

127
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,560
Cobra-sama...
How can you joke like that?

128
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,420
Yeah...

129
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,230
It is no joke.

130
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,880
I used Dance Powder to keep the rain
in the capital city of Alubarna.

131
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,100
As li'l ol' king-- no, I mean, as a
respected king, I cannot go thirsty.

132
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,150
T-That may be so,

133
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,870
but many have died due to lack
of food and water as a result!

134
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,880
Why would you allow--?!

135
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,710
I am aware of that, of course.

136
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,080
And that many oases have dried up.

137
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,910
But some sacrifices are unavoidable
if we are to protect the country.

138
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,170
This is crazy!

139
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,790
You knew how miserable things were,
yet you only helped yourself?!

140
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,800
That's far too selfish even for you, King!

141
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,260
Is a mere cretin like you trying
to talk back to me, the king?

142
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,070
I've come to Nanohana to
apologize for what I've done.

143
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,490
What more do you want?

144
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,310
My brother died in Yuba, you know...

145
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,660
I have come all the way to
this city for one other reason.

146
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,950
As you know, Dance Powder is
outlawed by the World Government.

147
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
If word of its use is leaked outside,

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,470
Navy Headquarters will take
action and destroy said country.

149
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,240
This must be avoided.

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,340
However, you may remember that
large amounts of Dance Powder

151
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,210
were found being smuggled
into this town two years ago.

152
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,180
It is necessary to eliminate
all traces of that incident.

153
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,810
Understand?

154
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,980
You don't mean...

155
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,620
That's right!

156
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,440
If we are to be rid of that
terrible incident forever,

157
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,440
we must be rid of this city and all of you!

158
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,380
W-What?!

159
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,500
That's insane!

160
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,280
We have to die just 'cause you ordered it?!

161
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,660
Hey! King!

162
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,140
So it was all your fault!

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,990
It's...

164
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,130
It's because you steal the rain that
all the towns are drying up, jerk!

165
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm gonna avenge everyone...

166
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,100
Don't!

167
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,380
King...

168
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,650
Men! Burn Nanohana to the ground!

169
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,670
Yes, Sire!

170
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,430
Koza!

171
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,540
Koza-san!

172
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,210
Koza. It's been a while.

173
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,170
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,070
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

175
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,310
King!

176
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,030
Stop!

177
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,650
I came to apologize, as you can see.

178
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,580
Quit screwing around! Shut up!

179
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,460
Do you realize what you're saying?!
This is an incredible insult!

180
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,970
I am the one who's been
using Dance Powder to--

181
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,760
I said shut up!

182
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,630
--Koza...
--Why are you so angry?

183
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,600
--Sire...
--Surely even you can appreciate...

184
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,330
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

185
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,300
...that I...

186
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,680
You asshole!

187
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,770
Do you know how the people felt
as they died in the dried-up towns?!

188
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,630
They didn't have hatred or anger for you!

189
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,160
"It isn't the king's fault!"

190
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,520
"He's a great person!"

191
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,550
Even as they died, they all
said that, with faith in you!

192
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,370
But what happens to them now,

193
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,500
unless you at least lie
and say you're innocent?!

194
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,430
Cobra...

195
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,940
Koza-san!

196
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,770
Leader!

197
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,970
Koza!

198
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,930
Well, I guess it's time!

199
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:15,420
Didn't we fight because
the kingdom-- no, everyone--

200
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,220
wanted to know that answer?!

201
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,210
At the very least...

202
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,250
...that's why I fought...

203
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,420
You can't be serious!

204
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,100
Here they come!

205
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,980
A giant ship is about to crash! Run!

206
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,540
What is that ship?!

207
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,750
Mommy!

208
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,760
I-It's toppling over!

209
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,840
For a final operation,
that sure lacked exertion.

210
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,180
Have we ever had any
exerting work before this?

211
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,410
We did it! Now light the
fires and let's retreat!

212
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,080
Yes, sir!

213
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,150
I just can't feel relaxed without this on!

214
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,650
Koza! Say something! Koza! Hey!

215
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,420
The royal army disappeared!

216
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,180
What?!

217
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,010
How deux you like my kingliness?!

218
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,270
That was great, Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

219
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,890
Put out the fires!

220
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,140
The damn royal army lit fires and ran off!

221
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,860
Hurry!

222
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Put out the fires!

223
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,870
Now to meet up with Mr. 2 outside town.

224
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,820
Alubarna's the finale.

225
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,730
I look forward to it.

226
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,260
Vague! My favorite word is "vague"!

227
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,070
Now whether or not the king
will stay king is vague!

228
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,670
The operation's a success!

229
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,380
Where's Bunchi?!

230
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,840
He's west of town, Mr. 2, Bon Clay-sama!

231
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,550
Huh? The king turned
into a weird ballerina...

232
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,010
It's no use! It won't go out!

233
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,430
Damn the king!

234
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,330
He was a fake!

235
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,130
This is bad! Everyone's being tricked!

236
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,220
I have to tell 'em!

237
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,930
What a naughty little boy.

238
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,110
What do you think he's discovered?

239
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,030
That damn imbecile
made a careless slip-up.

240
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,650
Who're you?!

241
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,620
I take it there's no use in
asking you to stay quiet.

242
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,810
Water! We need more water!

243
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,410
Wait! That's for my shop!
Can you pay for it?!

244
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,010
Not now, you idiot! The town is on fire!

245
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,890
Put out the fires!

246
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,220
Water!

247
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,170
It's no use! We can't
keep up with the fire!

248
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,430
We should probably run for it!

249
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,200
Hang in there, Koza!

250
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,410
You're not the type to die like this!

251
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,070
Hey! Take Koza!

252
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,900
Little boy! Say something!

253
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,820
This is terrible! Not even children are safe!

254
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,610
I-It's not...

255
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,340
What's that?!
I'll stop the bleeding! Don't talk!

256
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,320
It's not what you think!
Everyone's being tricked!

257
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,120
Hang in there, little boy!

258
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,350
Koza!

259
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,090
Let's... end this country.

260
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,660
Contact all of our branches!

261
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,000
This will be our final battle!

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
O-Okay, but we don't
have nearly enough weapons!

263
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
No, we do now.

264
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,980
Know that ship that just crashed?

265
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,550
It was an armory ship.

266
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,050
Seriously?!

267
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah! It was full of weapons!

268
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,020
It's almost like divine guidance.

269
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,470
Oh, really? A little pipsqueak saw me?

270
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,910
So sorry! So, so sorry!

271
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,200
Sheesh. Now Mr. 4's team
just needs to do its thing...

272
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,060
Fatty and Old Hag know
how to get things done!

273
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,730
Kidnapping the king
will be nothing to them!

274
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,590
Hear me, rebel army!

275
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,690
The Alabasta of old is long dead!

276
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,820
This is the final battle!
We're going to capture Alubarna!

277
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,780
We're going to launch an all-out assault!

278
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,660
The king must pay!

279
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,360
We'll build a new country!

280
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,330
"Meanwhile, at Alubarna Palace"

281
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,790
Nonsense!

282
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,440
Cobra-sama would never do such a thing!

283
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,670
It must be a mistake!

284
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,420
But the time between his disappearance
and his arrival fit perfectly!

285
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,070
Excuses no longer hold any water!

286
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,610
News of the Nanohana incident
have spread throughout Alabasta,

287
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,380
and rebel soldiers
everywhere have responded!

288
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,380
Not only that, the citizens
who had faith in His Majesty

289
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,870
have begun taking up weapons
out of hatred for him!

290
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,270
Their numbers are unknown!

291
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,730
The entire country is infuriated
and heading for Alubarna!

292
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,060
There's no stopping things now!

293
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,030
Please, make your decision!

294
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,140
We will obey you!

295
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,240
How can this be?!

296
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,830
Even the king's words from
yesterday are blurred now!

297
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,860
In what do I put my trust?!

298
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,940
Very well! We need only
fulfill our given duties!

299
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,690
We are the royal guards
of the Alabasta Kingdom!

300
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,260
No kingdom should crumble
in the absence of its king!

301
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,720
Protect the truth you see before you!

302
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,110
Protect this kingdom!

303
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,360
Counter the rebel army!

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,740
"Rainbase"

305
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,160
What a horrifying plan...

306
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,980
Well? Do you like it?

307
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,820
The operation you once
participated in has now blossomed.

308
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,300
If you listen closely, you could
probably hear the howls of Alabasta.

309
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,610
And they all think the same thing.

310
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,940
"Protect Alabasta."

311
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,210
"Protect Alabasta. Protect Alabasta."

312
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,320
Stop it!

313
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,250
How can you be so cruel?!

314
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,490
Isn't it just heartrending?

315
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,210
Love for the kingdom will be
what destroys the kingdom.

316
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,530
Is he stupid?

317
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,940
Did he not hear what I said?

318
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,690
He's definitely stupid.

319
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,900
But that's also why he's our captain.

320
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:07,390
Crocodile! I will kick your ass...

321
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,170
So many moves I've made
to make it this far...

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,250
The sabotage to instigate the citizens.

323
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,840
Directing the royal army's misconduct.

324
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,520
Have you any idea why I'd go to
such lengths to attain this country?

325
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,890
As if I'd understand anything
inside your rotten head!

326
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,570
You really are a bad-mouthed princess.

327
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,690
Vivi!

328
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,560
Now, now. What are you
trying to do, Miss Wednesday?

329
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,660
Stop you!

330
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,260
I'm going to stop you! There's still time!

331
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,790
If I can just get to Alubarna east of here...

332
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,700
If I can get there before the rebel army,

333
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,750
I may be able to stop them!

334
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,350
I absolutely refuse to let you have your way!

335
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,630
Vivi!

336
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

337
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,660
I couldn't even say half of it

338
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:42,180
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

339
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:55,560
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

340
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,770
Glory glory you're my shine

341
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:06,530
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

342
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,280
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

343
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm sure I'll make it there

344
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,630
What is that insanely huge alligator?!

345
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,130
Wow! There's an alligator
growing from that banana!

346
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,990
Don't be stupid!

347
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,060
The alligator swallowed the key to our cell!

348
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,790
What?! What a troublesome gator!

349
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,190
What is that eyebrow freak
doing at a time like this?!

350
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,680
Hang in there a little longer,
everyone! I will bring back help!

351
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

352
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,690
"The Terrifying Bananagators and Mr. Prince"

353
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
