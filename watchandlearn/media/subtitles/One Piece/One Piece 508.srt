2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,570
Luffy, depressed after losing his brother
Ace in the war against the Navy,

60
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,770
lamented over his weakness but soon
realized the importance of friendship.

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,760
At that moment, Dark King
Rayleigh appeared before Luffy.

62
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,910
I have a suggestion for you.

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,060
"Back to Our Captain!

64
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,230
A Jail Break at the Sky Island and
the Incident on the Winter Island!"

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,760
What?

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,220
Luffy-kun...

67
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,810
Luffy...

68
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,480
I didn't expect that...

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Rayleigh, what are you saying...

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,530
Luffy?

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,660
I think that's what you and
your friends need the most.

72
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,030
But don't you think what Luffy-kun
really needs now is...

73
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,580
...to get his body and mind healed?

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,420
But my friends will...

75
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,930
Yeah, I think they will
try to get to Sabaody.

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,390
The news about you has spread
all over the world already.

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,660
I bet it has reached your friends by now.

78
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,400
Then, I have to see them...

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,810
I promised them. I gotta go.

80
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,860
To Sabaody!

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,500
Then, here's my second suggestion.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,300
Huh?

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,130
Meanwhile...

84
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,810
On the small Sky Island - Weatheria,
where scientists study the weather...

85
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,640
Is it really true?

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,560
That young girl...

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,300
...tried to escape from this island?

88
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,340
Yes, it's true.

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,180
Where are you going, young girl...

90
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,490
She suddenly disappeared
from the Weather Field

91
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,990
and showed up at the Balloon Terminal...

92
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,970
Please! Don't get in my way!

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,460
Then she hijacked a balloon
carrying a heavy load!

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
However...

95
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,080
What happened?! It's out of control!

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,100
Damn! What's wrong with this balloon?!

97
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,200
Ow, ow, ow...

98
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,530
Somebody stop this thing!

99
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,130
No!!

100
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,260
It's coming this way!

101
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,300
Run fast!

102
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,470
Move, move!

103
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,440
And that's what happened.

104
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,070
I had no clue that she'd
do something like that.

105
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,000
I wonder what made her do such a thing.

106
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,380
CRIME

107
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,010
Let me out! I'll give you back what I took!

108
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,970
I gotta go somewhere!

109
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,040
Hey, let me out of here already!

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,850
Oh yeah! Haredas-san... Call Haredas-san!

111
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,410
Please!

112
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,360
We won't let you out! We don't
know what you'd do next!

113
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
How should we punish this young girl?!

114
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,990
A sentence of flooding or lightning?

115
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,700
You common cat burglar!

116
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,160
I won't do anything!

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,560
Just let me out of here!

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,290
No way!

119
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,300
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

120
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,880
Oh, Mr. Haredas!

121
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,470
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

122
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,470
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

123
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,310
Hey! Hey, hey, young girl.

125
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,620
That's too much!

126
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,230
Seems like you're really in a rage again.

127
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,650
Ta-dah!

128
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,070
This can help. Let me show you something.

129
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,070
These are tightly tied Wind Knots!

130
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,500
Mr. Haredas!!

131
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,090
I said "let me out"! You want
another one?! I'm in hurry!

132
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,750
Mr. Haredas! Can you hear us?! Mr. Haredas!

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,850
Yes, this is Haredas...

134
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,810
She hit him rather than
talk to him! She's a devil!

135
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,150
Doctor! Call the doctor!

136
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,610
What?

137
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,320
She stole Weather balls from the
Weather Field and our research notes?

138
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,980
As you see here, Mr. Haredas.

139
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,090
Young girl...

140
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,740
I used to be a thief and I'm a pirate now.

141
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,880
What's wrong with stealing?

142
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,220
She's the worst kind of human being!

143
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,800
We have such a villain in our country!

144
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,450
Like I said... I wanna
get out of this country!

145
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,350
Let me out of here! I'm begging you!

146
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,270
I gotta go now! You got
back what I stole, right?

147
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,980
Hey, let me out!

148
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,740
Don't get too close! She's very violent!

149
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,050
What's the matter with you all of the sudden?

150
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,280
You tried to hijack the balloon and
go down to the sea, didn't you?

151
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,550
Amateurs can't operate a
balloon. You could have died.

152
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,800
You were very eager to learn
the science of weather.

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,980
What happened to you?

154
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,480
It's in that newspaper.

155
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,690
Newspaper?

156
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,450
The "Luffy" in that newspaper
is the captain of our ship.

157
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,700
What?!

158
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,360
Oh, it's this guy.

159
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,370
They said he caused quite
a stir in the previous war.

160
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,870
He's a hot rookie with a Straw Hat.

161
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,640
Oh, I never would have thought
that this boy was your captain.

162
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,640
After his crew was separated,

163
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,120
Luffy must've been fighting
such a hard battle on his own.

164
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,940
And he took part in the War of the
Best in order to rescue Ace, and...

165
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,200
...he saw Ace killed right before his eyes!

166
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,660
And I didn't even... know about it!

167
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,090
I know that Luffy will be there

168
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,710
at the place where we promised to meet!

169
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,780
Before he is completely broken,

170
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,510
I wanna see him and support him!

171
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,860
Oh, hey, hey, hey, young girl!

172
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,900
Let her out now!

173
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,860
We're so violent! We abducted
a young girl and made her cry!

174
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,900
--Give the key to Mr. Haredas!
--The key, the key!

175
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,830
Here, you can come out now.
I'm sorry, young girl...

176
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,750
--Where did she go?
--I don't see Mr. Haredas, either.

177
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,810
Huh? How did she make it that far?!

178
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,350
Thanks! Bye!

179
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,890
Huh?! What the...!

180
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,060
She pretended to cry and now
she took Mr. Haredas hostage!

181
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,650
And she took the stolen goods, too!

182
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,360
--We can't let her get away!
--Catch her!

183
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,530
Weatheria's science of
weather  must be kept secret!

184
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,980
Chase her!

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,120
I don't care where! Please
take me down to the sea!

186
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,670
--That's impossible...
--Make it possible!

187
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,050
Luffy! I know that you're okay!

188
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,480
I'm sorry!-- You've always supported us!

189
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,930
It's our chance to return the favor!

190
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,010
Catch her! Don't let her get away!

191
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,350
Oh, young girl, you haven't
stop pretending to cry.

192
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,040
Shut up!

193
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,600
Meanwhile, on the Winter
Island Future Land Baldimore

194
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,960
where the genius Vegapunk was born...

195
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,560
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

196
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,350
Geek! Geek! Geek! Geek! Geek!
Geek! Geek! Geek! Gee...

197
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,530
I mean, god!

198
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,860
What's wrong, Kitton?

199
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,360
Well, the old man has become
another person again!

200
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,030
He's like a demon this time!

201
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
Is there a ship?!

202
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,570
Here he comes!

203
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,340
I bet you put something strange
in his stomach, didn't you?

204
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,770
Like habanero juice or kimchi soda?

205
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,760
No, I didn't!

206
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,850
Hey, grandpa!

207
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,470
I gotta go see my friend as soon as possible!

208
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,070
Give me a ship... A ship to take!

209
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,880
Ship?

210
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,570
No, I can't do that.

211
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,450
Because we don't have a ship on this island.

212
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,040
There is a liner that brings
us supplies once a month

213
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,080
and Navy ships that come irregularly.

214
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,050
When is the liner due?

215
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,220
It just came a week ago.

216
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,890
Damn! I gotta wait for 3 weeks?!

217
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,970
This country is surrounded by thick
ice. It's like a natural fortress.

218
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:09,080
In order to get here, you need an
ice-breaker with special equipment.

219
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,300
Damn it all!

220
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,860
I can build a new ship but
it'll take too much time!

221
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,040
Ol-Old man, you need to calm down.

222
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,580
Good smell... Flavor!

223
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,370
I don't have any time for this!

224
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,840
I have to get off of this island at any cost!

225
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,340
With all that he's going through now...

226
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,880
What am I doing here?!

227
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,620
Damn!

228
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,540
Old man.

229
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,420
Seems like you have a good
reason but nothing can be done.

230
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,260
Oh yeah!

231
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,030
If I remember correctly,

232
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,980
there was an
ice-breaker developed by Vegapunk at his laboratory.

233
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,280
He made it years ago, so I don't
know if it still works...

234
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,570
No! It's too dangerous!
I'm not gonna go this time.

235
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,570
It's that place again...

236
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,500
"Again"? Don't tell me
that you snuck in there!

237
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,980
--Yeah, a while ago.
--Uh-huh, a while ago.

238
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
What?!

239
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,000
I can repair it! Because I'm a shipwright!

240
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,800
Oh no, that's not what I'm concerned...

241
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,420
Let's go back there now!

242
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,060
Listen to me!

243
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,790
Too cold!

244
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,280
We have an intruder!

245
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,820
Someone's breaking into
Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory!

246
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,840
Don't use any firearms inside!

247
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,200
Remember that you're surrounded by
priceless treasures! Understood?

248
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,580
Roger that!

249
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,710
Stop!

250
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,550
Damn! I didn't expect Navy soldiers here!

251
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,870
They tightened the security after I broke in!

252
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,160
No, I shouldn't.

253
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,770
I'm not gonna shoot!

254
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,560
Don't let him get away! Go!

255
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,070
Treasure? That laboratory?

256
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,160
Yes, Vegapunk works for the Navy
as head of all the sciences

257
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,330
and we feel proud of him!

258
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,790
I mean, you can say that his
brain is a world-class treasure.

259
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,000
This is where Vegapunk spent his boyhood.

260
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,020
Take a look at that mountain.
It has an odd shape, doesn't it?

261
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,010
It does when I come to
think of it... What is it?

262
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,360
That's something he made when he was a kid,

263
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,350
to help the people in this
country from severe cold.

264
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,220
He converted animals in the forest
into a work force and almost finished it

265
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,830
but it's still incomplete.

266
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,200
It's an earth heating system that
will warm the whole island up.

267
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,370
But as with many of his ideas,

268
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,040
he couldn't make what was in his head real.

269
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,040
There wasn't enough technology
or money to make it happen.

270
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,380
But seeing him sad that he
couldn't make everyone happy...

271
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,220
...warmed our hearts.

272
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,750
It's super tearjerking!

273
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,060
Oh, is it?

274
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,690
We are always waiting for him to come home.

275
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,400
If you understand,

276
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,490
please don't ever go into
the laboratory with the self-destruct button.

277
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,010
What?

278
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,540
Did you just throw out the name of
the most unwanted button in the world?

279
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,090
I didn't know that.

280
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,360
Say old man, let's go home!

281
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,120
Let's go home and drink hot tea!

282
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
I can't do that!

283
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,430
Because that's the only place
that has an ice-breaker,

284
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,810
which I need to get off of this island!

285
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,770
I have to do it!

286
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,940
I just learned the news
of my captain's ordeals.

287
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,240
Bye! Thank you for everything!

288
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,240
Wait! Don't ever push the
self-destruct button!

289
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,790
Why would I, stupid?!

290
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,290
Why did he
put one in in the first place?!

291
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Hey, I just saw somebody!
It's this way! Hurry up!

292
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,720
Where's the ice-breaker?!

293
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,900
Stop!

294
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,560
Hey, somebody broke into the laboratory!

295
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,030
Really? That's not good!

296
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,240
Even a blueprint from there is priceless.

297
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,900
Stop!

298
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,900
I think I outran them.

299
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,900
To all soldiers!

300
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,230
If you break something in the
genius Vegapunk's house while in pursuit...

301
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,920
--...it's a breach of the criminal code!
--Yes, sir!

302
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,740
It's all super brilliant! I can't believe
these are all from his younger days.

303
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,390
A lot of these ideas would need a couple
hundred years to implement fully.

304
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,470
They're right. As an engineer, I
don't wanna mess with anything here.

305
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, it's a pirate mark!

306
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,190
Can I ask you something? If I
push that button by any chance...

307
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,400
Old man?

308
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,710
Is it gonna be my fault?

309
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,430
Of course it is!

310
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,440
This incident on the Future Land

311
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,830
will be known around the world
as Baldimore's nightmare.

312
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,510
After hearing about the War of the Best,

313
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,310
Zoro races full-tilt toward the sea.

314
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,600
Mihawk watches him approach with cool eyes.

315
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,310
What will come of their reunion?

316
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,480
Meanwhile, Luffy sets a huge plan in motion!

317
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

318
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,720
"Encounter! The Great Swordsman Mihawk!
Zoro's Self-Willed Deadly Struggle!"

319
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
