2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,440
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,430
Luffy made a raid on the Navy HQ

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,650
to rescue his brother,
Ace, who had been jailed,

62
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,320
only to see Ace killed right before his eyes.

63
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,050
Taken from the Navy HQ to the Maiden Island,

64
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,870
the deeply depressed Luffy is now...

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,790
I'm too weak! I can't save anybody!

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,590
Can't you see things clearly now?!

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,590
Don't just think about the ones you've lost!

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,670
You can't get back what you've lost!

69
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,230
What is it that you still have?!

70
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,920
I still have...

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,200
I still have my friends!

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,340
I wanna see them now...

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,260
I wanna see them!!

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,300
"Straw Hats in Shock!
The Bad News Has Reached Them!"

75
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,860
This is the Gloom Island in the Grand Line -

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,030
GLOOM ISLAND

77
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,570
the ruins of Muggy Kingdom.

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,070
Wh-What are they?

79
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,290
B-Baboons?!

80
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,630
What are they talking about?

81
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,060
No idea.

82
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,100
They don't look like they
can be reasoned with anyway!

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,420
Three-Sword Style...

84
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,370
...Bull Demon...

85
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,580
...Courageous Talons!

86
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,690
Oh no! There are more of them!

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,830
They are...

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,800
...using weapons like humans!

89
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,300
Three-Sword Style...

90
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,710
Dragon Twister!

91
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,160
What?!

92
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,320
My wound from before has been reopened!

93
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,690
Hey... Hey, are you breathing?!

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,030
Shut up... Don't distract me now...

95
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,720
How annoying!

96
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,640
How can you say that to someone
who's only worrying about you?

97
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,370
Why should I worry about
him in the first place?

98
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,420
This is no good.

99
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,450
This energy...

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,940
It's...!

101
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,320
You're...!

102
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,110
"Hawk-Eye"...

103
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,940
...Mihawk!

104
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,250
Meanwhile, in South Blue's Birdie Kingdom...

105
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,750
BIRDIE KINGDOM

106
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,750
...where the birds and
humans are always fighting.

107
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,670
Don't eat me in a hot pot!

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,010
We caught the racoon again!

109
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,510
Racoon! Racoon!

110
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,760
I said I'm not a racoon!

111
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,590
Dad, he said he's not a racoon.

112
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,510
That's ridiculous! A racoon can't talk!

113
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,610
I am talking! You need to
listen to your kid sometimes!

114
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,530
I'm a reindeer and I can speak
like humans! And I'm a doctor!

115
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,370
That's ridiculous! A racoon can't talk!

116
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,320
Dad, he's talking!

117
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,860
You got it, finally? Then get me down now.

118
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,500
Let me see your butt.

119
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,140
Wow!

120
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,560
This is a cream for burns.

121
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,600
We make all kinds of medicine out of plants.

122
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,980
Really? So you have other
kinds, too? Can I see them?

123
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,730
We don't have them now.

124
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,730
The plants we make medicine
out of grow on that big tree.

125
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,200
But the mean birds who made
their nest here a year ago

126
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
block us from going up to pick them.

127
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,040
We're running out of most medicines, so
the number of sick people is increasing.

128
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,370
She's my friend.

129
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,330
This is...

130
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,750
I can't breathe.

131
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,710
Her life is in danger.

132
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,050
We have no time to lose!

133
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,430
Let's put this to rest!

134
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,220
It's do or die!

135
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,350
This is war! Prepare for anything!

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,180
Dad!

137
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,270
Son, take care of your mother!

138
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,650
W-Wait a minute! Don't jump the gun!

139
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,400
As a doctor, I can't just ignore sick people.

140
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm gonna see the birds and tell
them to stop making trouble!

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,620
Really, Racoon?

142
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,810
Don't worry. I can talk with animals.

143
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,540
And...

144
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,120
...don't make me repeat
myself! I'm not a racoon!

145
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,480
I got along with the cheeper.
The birds will understand me.

146
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,840
Racoon! It's not like I don't trust you

147
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,990
but I don't think those mean
birds will listen to you.

148
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,870
If anything goes wrong,

149
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,130
we have no choice!

150
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,420
What's up?

151
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,310
I'm here to talk to you.

152
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,560
The humans in the forest have a big problem!

153
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,690
Huh? "We won't let them have the treasure"?

154
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,900
What do you mean?

155
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
Racoon!

156
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,200
W-W-Wait a minute!

157
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,290
Ow, ow... Damn!

158
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,370
Rumble!

159
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
Arm Boost!

160
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,830
What treasure?

161
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,630
Why do you hate humans that much?!

162
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,850
You guys!

163
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,310
The talks broke down, Racoon!

164
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,480
We have no choice!

165
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,500
Guard Boost!

166
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,220
Racoon!

167
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,860
Damn!

168
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,450
Neither the humans nor the birds on this
island will listen to other people!

169
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,400
Dammit!

170
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,430
Are you the cheeper from the other day?!

171
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,010
You got better!

172
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,640
Everybody! Listen to me!

173
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,380
I see!

174
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,560
Looks like they came to an understanding.

175
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,690
Listen! The birds had a
compelling reason, too.

176
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,890
They like glittering things and they've been

177
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,490
collecting them from all over the world

178
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,970
but some humans tried to steal them

179
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,290
and chased them away from their home island.

180
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,400
That's why they thought

181
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,750
that humans will come after
them on this island again.

182
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,000
These are... the medical plants!

183
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,320
Is that enough?

184
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,220
If you have extra, put
some cream on me again...

185
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,010
Racoon!

186
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,570
It doesn't hurt!

187
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,060
Here is a shiny thing for you!

188
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,680
You guys hit it off already!

189
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,210
Oh, News Coo!

190
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,300
Thank you for the newspaper!

191
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,890
Let's see...

192
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,000
Meanwhile, on the small
Sky Island Weatheria...

193
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,810
WEATHERIA

194
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,840
Gee, you need to use the
lower half of your body more!

195
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,910
Are you even trying, young girl?

196
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,480
No, I'm not! What I wanted to
learn is the science of weather,

197
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,070
not field work! Do you understand?!

198
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,740
This is a part of the science of weather.

199
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,210
This is the Weather Field
where we grow Weather balls.

200
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,750
There's always some manual labor in science.

201
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,340
Damn! He should have told me that.

202
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,350
Oh, News Coo! You brought the newspaper?

203
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,640
Thank you!

204
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,270
Let's see how the weather's
gonna be tomorrow...

205
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,140
Let me see it!

206
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,530
BOWIN ISLANDS

207
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,530
On Bowin Islands in the Grand Line,

208
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,230
Usopp has been eating an
abundant variety of food

209
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,120
and gaining a lot of weight!

210
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,540
How do you like my body?

211
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,170
You better stop eating'n! Usopp'n!

212
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,590
It's not muscle'n.

213
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,590
It's visceral fat'n!

214
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,670
You're gonna get a lifestyle disease'n!

215
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't care as long as I can get stronger!

216
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,970
He has no ear'n.

217
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,980
--It's the newspaper'n!
--Ah, hop!

218
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,930
Grilled Chicken!

219
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,940
Don't eat that'n!

220
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,410
KAMABAKKA KINGDOM

221
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,200
On Peachy Island Kamabakka Kingdom...

222
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,680
Hey! Stop!

223
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,390
What a beautiful sunset.

224
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,260
Oh, bird-san!

225
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,340
Thank you!

226
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,970
How's my love horoscope today...

227
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,640
What's wrong?

228
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,220
What the hell is this?!

229
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,670
At Tequila Wolf in the East Blue...

230
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,410
TEQUILA WOLF

231
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,430
Nico Robin, here...

232
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Thank you. How did you know my name?

233
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,140
All the soldiers in the Revolutionary
army know about you.

234
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,610
Could you trust us and come with us?

235
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,910
I'm sorry, but I have to see my friends!

236
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,720
It's very important to me.

237
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,910
I see. That's too bad.

238
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,580
"Your friends" means the Straw Hats?

239
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,920
We got some information about them.

240
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll tell you if you like.

241
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,880
Please. I'm very interested!

242
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,810
On the Winter Island Future Land Baldimore...

243
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,810
BALDIMORE DR. VEGAPUNK'S LABORATORY

244
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,560
Cola up!

245
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh, I missed this feeling of it
circulating all over the body!

246
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,740
I didn't expect to see a mechanical
animal inside of the laboratory.

247
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,540
The mechanical polar bear...

248
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,680
...hit me!

249
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,250
And the refrigerator that I crashed
into had a load of cola inside!

250
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
And I beat him!

251
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,920
It ended up great!

252
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,590
What's that?

253
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,520
LAZY BONES ISLAND HUNGERIA

254
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,520
On the Lazy Bones Island Hungeria...

255
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,040
How terrifying to hear
that voice of resentment!

256
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,030
Satan-sama must be performing
a forbidden ritual

257
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,450
to curse the Longarm Tribe to death!

258
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,250
I lost my concentration.

259
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,630
It's getting more ominous!

260
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,690
45 degree angle! Oh no, it's 60 degrees!

261
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,760
I got into an awful slump!

262
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,520
Am I being punished for
seeing too many panties?

263
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,310
This is...!

264
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,530
You better not do that, Roronoa Zoro.

265
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,070
You've been injured beyond your limit.

266
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,410
Do you think you can beat me when
you can't even beat the baboons?

267
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,000
Why the hell are you here?!

268
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,090
I've been living in that castle
quite a while. Why are you here?

269
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,630
I got blown away by Kuma, a member
of The Seven Warlords like yourself!

270
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,380
I see.

271
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,560
That explains why Straw Hat
came to Marineford with other people.

272
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,400
You saw Luffy?! How was he?! Was he alright?!

273
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
He's still alive probably.

274
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,000
But I assume that he's been
very badly traumatized.

275
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,250
What happened?

276
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,370
He lost his brother.

277
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,250
No way!

278
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,960
You can't be serious!

279
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,750
Oh my!

280
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,630
You must be kidding me...

281
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,760
I can't believe this...

282
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,430
What... did you say?

283
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,800
"Fire Fist" Ace...

284
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,940
...died before Straw Hat's eyes.

285
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,780
Luffy...

286
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,120
Luffy!!

287
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,070
Luffy decides to head for
the Sabaody Archipelago

288
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,230
to fulfill his promise to
reunite with his companions.

289
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,330
Just then, the Dark King Rayleigh appears.

290
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,680
As Luffy expresses his
surprise at their reunion,

291
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,180
Rayleigh makes an even more
unexpected proposal...

292
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,530
On the next episode of One Piece!

293
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,190
"Reunited with Dark King Rayleigh!
Decision Time for Luffy!"

294
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
