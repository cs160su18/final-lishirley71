2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,760
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,660
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,260
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the Grand Line
in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,630
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,980
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,820
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,100
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,540
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,840
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:25,400
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,200
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,280
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,500
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,710
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,210
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,470
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,370
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
We are!

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,160
What great weather!

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
If we keep going this way,

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,980
we should see the
navy base island soon!

27
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,900
Wow, Coby!
You're amazing!

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,580
We're actually gonna
reach our destination?

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,680
But of course!

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,280
These are the bare
minimum skills all sailors need!

31
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,490
This is no time
to be laughing, Luffy-san.

32
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,420
He's being held prisoner there.

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,180
The famous pirate hunter...

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,940
Roronoa Zoro!

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,700
The man who's chopped up
bounties like a bloodthirsty beast...

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,580
People say he's a
demon in human form!

37
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,790
"Enter the Great Swordsman!
Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro"

38
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,130
We made it!
The navy base city!

39
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,230
Seriously, Luffy-san!

40
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,250
You're crazy to want him to join you!

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,200
I still haven't decided yet.
I just wanna see if he's a good guy...

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,470
He's been caught
because he's a bad guy!

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,200
Mm! Yum!

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,420
Do you know if Zoro's at the base?

45
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,900
It would seem the name "Zoro" is taboo here...

46
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,490
Well, let's check out the base anyway.

47
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,200
You're gonna be a marine, right?

48
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,770
Y-Yes... But I'm not really ready yet...

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,940
Rumor has it...

50
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,870
...a guy named
Captain Morgan is at this base, and...

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,430
What a funny town!

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,950
It's strange...

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,020
I understand Zoro, but why are
they afraid of a navy captain's name?

54
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,470
I suddenly feel uneasy about this...

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,980
You sure they didn't jump just for fun?

56
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,390
Nobody would do that!

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,900
Alright! This's the place!

58
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm finally here!

59
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,420
I guess this is where
we part ways, Luffy-san.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,310
It was only for a short time, but...

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,080
Upsy-daisy!

62
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Luffy-san! What in the world are you doing?!

63
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,870
Now where's this demon?!

64
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,400
He wouldn't be out here.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm sure he's in
a prison cell or something...

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,430
There he is!

67
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,710
Alright!

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
See! There he is!

69
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, right!
He wouldn't be out--

70
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,860
A black hood and a haramaki...

71
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,570
That's Roronoa Zoro!

72
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,640
He can get away easy
if we untie those ropes!

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,840
D-Don't be stupid!

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
There's no telling what'll
happen if we let him loose!

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,820
I bet he'd try to kill you too, Luffy-san!

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,700
Don't worry! I'm strong!

77
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,200
I can't believe this guy!

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, you guys.

79
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,040
You're an eyesore.

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,670
Get lost!

81
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,730
Luffy-san! There's no way you
could survive with him on your crew!

82
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,920
Oh no!
Stop her, Luffy-san!

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,570
She'll be killed!

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,920
What?

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,770
You must be hungry!
I made you some rice balls!

86
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,430
Do you wanna get killed, pipsqueak? Scram!

87
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,910
You haven't eaten anything this whole time.

88
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,470
Here! This is my first time,

89
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,830
but I worked really hard to make them!

90
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,430
I ain't hungry!

91
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,060
You're an eyesore!
Get the hell outta here!

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,830
But...

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,890
I don't want 'em!
Don't make me kick your ass!

94
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,890
It's not nice to be a bully!

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,730
You seem surprisingly well, Roronoa Zoro...

96
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,290
Now there's another weird guy!

97
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,480
Thank goodness!

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,610
He must be with the navy!
Now that girl will be safe!

99
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,630
Oh? Those are some
tasty-looking rice balls.

100
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,570
Stop!

101
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,910
Too damn sweet!

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,060
Those're full of sugar!

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,040
You're supposed to use salt for rice balls!

104
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,370
But I thought they
might taste better sweet...

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,040
--Take this! And this!
--Stop! Stop!

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,630
H-How horrible!

107
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,060
And I worked so hard to make those...

108
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,680
Did you not read this notice?

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,720
"Those who help
criminals will be executed!

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Navy Captain Morgan"

111
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,070
Looks like even little brats
know how scary my dad is!

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,840
Dad?

113
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,370
Then that's Captain Morgan's son?!

114
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,020
You. Throw this kid out.

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,580
Sir?!

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,610
I said throw her over the wall!

117
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,000
Or can you not follow my orders?!
Don't make me tell my dad!

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,420
Y-Yes, sir!
Right away!

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
No!

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,700
I-I'm sorry, little girl.
Curl yourself into a ball.

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,210
T-Thanks...

122
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,520
Are you all right, Luffy-san?!

123
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,360
Are you all right?!

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,800
I can't believe how
horrible that guy is!

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,490
Do you hurt anywhere?

126
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,070
Damn you...

127
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,860
You sure are stubborn about staying alive...

128
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,120
Yeah! I will live the full month!

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,060
Well, good luck with that.

130
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,020
Ten days left, you know!

131
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,740
Assuming you can live that long!

132
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,850
How can he be so cruel, Luffy-san?!

133
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,060
He's gone?!

134
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,630
I hear you're a bad guy.

135
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,290
Are you still here?

136
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,800
Being stuck out here for all to see...

137
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Are you really strong at all?!

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,750
Mind your own business!

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,750
If it were me, I'd probably
starve to death in three days!

140
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,080
I got more spirit than you.

141
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,440
I will live through this...

142
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,470
I swear it!

143
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,540
What a strange person!

144
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,500
Wait!

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Could you pick that up for me?

146
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,080
You're gonna eat this?

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,140
It's mostly a mud ball now.

148
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,760
Just shut up and give it here!

149
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,960
Told you so.

150
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,400
It was good.

151
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,860
Thanks for the food.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,490
Really?!

153
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,810
Yeah! He ate every last bite!

154
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,210
I'm so happy!

155
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,660
Is Zoro really as evil
as the rumors say?

156
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,210
No!

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,330
After all, he let himself
get crucified in our place...

158
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,850
Huh? What do you mean?

159
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,300
It's all that Helmeppo's fault.

160
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,910
He's Captain Morgan's son...

161
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,270
Outta the way!

162
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,220
Make way for my adorable pet-sama!

163
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,730
Get in the way, and you get executed!

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,950
No! Stop that!

165
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,570
Hey, you!

166
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,660
You gonna complain about
what my pet-sama's doin'?!

167
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,360
Rika! Stop that!

168
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,830
We'll get in trouble
if we go against him!

169
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,860
--Oh, crap!
--He's in trouble now!

170
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,110
Who the hell are you?!

171
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,800
Don't tell me you're...

172
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,780
...pirate hunter Zoro?

173
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,540
And if I am?

174
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,580
Why is a pirate hunter defying the navy?!

175
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,770
Just shut up and let me eat in peace!

176
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Why, you...

177
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,220
You're annoying me.
Both you and your pet-sama!

178
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,050
You do realize that if my
dad finds out about this,

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,890
they're gonna get
executed for sure!

180
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,060
Whadya say?
Let's make a deal!

181
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,920
You get strung up in place
of this mother and daughter!

182
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,450
For, yeah, one month...

183
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,220
If you can survive for one month,

184
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,220
I'll let you live, too.

185
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,920
Whadya say?

186
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,120
One month.

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
It's been three weeks since then.

188
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,670
Helmeppo punches and
kicks him while he's tied up!

189
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,540
I... I...

190
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
I see...

191
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,430
I'm hungry!
Let us all eat for free!

192
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,260
Hey! Bring me some booze!

193
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,220
Quit dawdling! Hurry it up!

194
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,250
Oh, yes.

195
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,930
I've been bored lately,

196
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,480
so I've decided
to execute Zoro tomorrow.

197
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,350
Look forward to it!

198
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,470
W-What the hell're you doing?!

199
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,580
Luffy-san! Please stop!

200
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,670
This guy is scum!

201
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,150
Y-You hit me!

202
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm Captain Morgan's son, you know!

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,590
So what?!

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,550
I'm gonna tell my dad
and he's gonna execute you!

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,820
Fight me yourself!

206
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,580
Luffy-san! Calm down!

207
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,610
Are you trying to get
on the navy's bad side?!

208
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,720
I've made up my mind, Coby!

209
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm... going to have Zoro join my crew!

210
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,140
I am...

211
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,070
great!

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes! You're exactly right,
Captain Morgan, sir!

213
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,540
But hasn't tribute to me
been a bit lacking lately?

214
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,250
W-Well, the citizens'
wallets do have their limits...

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,960
The issue is the level of respect for me.

216
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,430
Wouldn't you agree?

217
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,640
Dad!

218
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,930
There's someone I want you to slaughter!

219
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,180
You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!

220
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,500
I promised her...

221
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,280
I can't afford to die
in a place like this!

222
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,750
You again?
You sure have lots of free time.

223
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,360
I'll untie you, so join my crew!

224
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,460
Say what?!

225
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,080
I'm looking for people
to join my pirate crew.

226
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,560
Forget it!
Me, stooping to a criminal's level?!

227
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,710
Screw that!

228
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,200
What's wrong with being a pirate?!

229
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,690
Pirates are despicable!
As if I'd wanna be one!

230
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,320
Oh, come on!

231
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,640
You're already known
as an evil bounty hunter!

232
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,480
People can say whatever they want,

233
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,100
but I ain't done anything I regret.

234
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,110
I will live through this
and accomplish what I want!

235
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah?

236
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,400
But I've decided you're gonna join me!

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,940
Quit deciding on your own!

238
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,490
I hear you use swords.

239
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,620
Yeah. But that stupid son took my stuff...

240
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,450
--I'll go get it back for you!
--What?!

241
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,440
So if you want your sword, join my crew!

242
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,110
You're really getting on my nerves!

243
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,220
Is he planning to bust
into the base by himself?!

244
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,970
You idiot! The base is
in the other direction!

245
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,270
Gum-Gum Rocket!

246
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,400
W-Who the hell is that guy?!

247
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,750
Alright! Stop there!

248
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,330
Stand it up in one shot!

249
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,250
Dad! Why aren't you
going to get revenge?!

250
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,030
The guy hit me!

251
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,920
Not even you've ever hit me in the face!

252
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,640
Do you know why I've never hit you before?

253
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,260
Eh? Because you think I'm--

254
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,260
Yes. Because you're...

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,740
...a stupid son who
isn't even worth hitting!

256
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,910
Don't get the wrong idea!

257
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,830
Your dad is the one who's great! Me!

258
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,800
Which reminds me, I hear a rat
snuck into the crucifixion yard.

259
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,440
I-I-If you mean that pipsqueak,
I made sure she was dealt with--

260
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,760
You killed her, I hope?!

261
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,220
N-No! I mean, she was just a little kid...

262
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,380
You, there!

263
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,390
Go into town and exterminate her!

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,870
Y-You can't be serious!
She's just a little girl!

265
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,880
I can't in good conscience...

266
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,350
Anyone who disobeys my
orders is a traitor, even little brats.

267
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,030
B-But... I can't do it!

268
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,190
Lieutenant!

269
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,290
Y-You didn't have to go that far!

270
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,230
It was with my strength that
I rose to my rank of captain!

271
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,130
Listen! In this world,
titles mean everything!

272
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,500
That means that I, the captain and
highest ranking officer at this base,

273
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,180
am the most superior person here!

274
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,510
So everything I do is right!

275
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,690
Isn't that right, you guys?!

276
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,770
Yes, sir!
You're absolutely correct!

277
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,340
The kid's death can wait for now.

278
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,610
Observe! This is the symbol of my authority,

279
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,720
which took many years to finally complete!

280
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,480
Now, stand it up!

281
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,290
Display my greatness
at the top of this base!

282
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,920
That's weird.
There's no one here...

283
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,080
I gotta find that stupid son
and get Zoro's sword back.

284
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,510
Pull! Pull!

285
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,300
You, there!

286
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,440
You bumped it, didn't you?!

287
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,280
I heard something up there...

288
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,540
I-I'm sorry, sir! I was careless!

289
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,480
I told you to think
of this statue as me!

290
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,620
The slightest scratch or speck
of dirt is treachery against me!

291
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,220
I'll just check it out!

292
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,290
Gum-Gum...

293
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,890
...Rocket!

294
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,880
Now you pay!

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
I jumped too far!

296
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,220
--What is that?!
--It flew up from below!

297
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,280
I stopped!

298
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,110
Sorry...

299
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,780
Seize him!
I'm going to kill him!

300
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,240
Yes, sir!
Right away!

301
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,990
Dad! That's him!
He's the guy who hit me!

302
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,790
Oh! It's you!

303
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,640
I've been looking for you!

304
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040
Come with me!
There's something I want you to give back!

305
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,500
--Let me go!
--Helmeppo-sama!

306
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,690
After him!
Don't let him escape!

307
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,090
Captain! There's someone
in the crucifixion yard!

308
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,430
What?!

309
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,290
It's one traitor after the other...

310
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,470
After him!
After him!

311
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,450
Hurry!

312
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,890
Someone just had to interrupt...

313
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,700
Where is Zoro's sword?!

314
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,170
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!
Just stop dragging me!

315
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,430
Alright! Talk!

316
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,620
In my room...
We just passed it...

317
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,920
What? Why didn't you say so?
Now we gotta go back.

318
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,630
--Freeze!
--Let Helmeppo-sama go!

319
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,100
No.

320
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,890
Go ahead and shoot, if you dare!

321
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,970
No! Don't!

322
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,520
Please escape, Zoro-san!

323
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,600
You'll be killed for doing that, you know!

324
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,510
I can't stand to watch
the navy like this anymore.

325
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,940
I want to be
an honorable marine!

326
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,320
Stop! I can't escape!
I only got ten days until--

327
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,370
You're going to be
executed tomorrow!

328
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,240
What?!

329
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,290
Helmeppo never once
intended to honor your agreement!

330
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,470
So Luffy-san got angry and punched him!

331
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,000
He did?

332
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,510
The navy is after Luffy-san now.

333
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,860
I won't ask you to be a pirate.

334
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,210
But please, help Luffy-san!

335
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,780
Luffy-san is the only
one who can save you.

336
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,400
And I think you're also the only
one who can save Luffy-san now.

337
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,240
End of the line!

338
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,320
For the crime of treachery against me,

339
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,290
I'll now execute you two where you stand!

340
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,250
This the room?!

341
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,220
Bingo!

342
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,520
But there are three here!

343
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,180
Hey! Which sword is Zoro's?

344
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,930
Oh, he passed out.

345
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,930
Coby!

346
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,970
This is some interesting
stuff you guys've pulled!

347
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,620
Were you two and that straw hat
kid plannin' a coup or something?!

348
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,830
I've always fought alone.

349
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,290
Unlike arrogant bastards like
you who use soldiers as cronies!

350
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,690
Roronoa Zoro...

351
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,750
Don't you dare underestimate me!

352
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,040
You may be strong,

353
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,220
but before my authority,
you're as good as scum!

354
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,220
Aim!

355
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,110
I...

356
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,090
...can't afford to die here!

357
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,140
You're still as weak as ever, Zoro!

358
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,490
Gum-Gum...

359
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,660
...Rocket!

360
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Fire!

361
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,250
--What are you--?!
--Luffy-san!

362
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:36,870
Straw Hat?!

363
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,590
That doesn't work!

364
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
I told you I was strong!

365
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,810
W-Who the hell are you?!

366
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,820
I'm Monkey D. Luffy!

367
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,630
The man who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

368
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,990
"To be continued"

369
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

370
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

371
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,310
before someone else could
beat me to it

372
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

373
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,530
before I can even attain my dream

374
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:06,650
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

375
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:19,640
so that my memories won't fade

376
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm gonna be the world's greatest swordsman!

377
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,480
Great! Why not be a great swordsman pirate?!

378
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,590
Don't talk like it's so easy!

379
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,990
The soldiers have started to go berserk!

380
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,510
Probably 'cause we're
enemies of the navy now!

381
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,220
Here! I'll untie your ropes!

382
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,640
I gotta hurry! There has to be a
map to the Grand Line in this base!

383
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,500
Huh? The ropes are tighter now.

384
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,290
Hey!

385
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

386
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,700
"Morgan vs. Luffy!
Who's the Mysterious Pretty Girl?"

387
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!
