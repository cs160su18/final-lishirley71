00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,760
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,710
attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,840
The words he uttered just before
his death drove people to the seas.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,670
My treasure?
If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,240
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,030
And so men head for the
Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,490
The world has truly
entered a Great Pirate Era!

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,860
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,770
and set out in search
of something to find

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,270
ONE PIECE!

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,690
Compasses only cause delays

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,970
Delirious with fever,
I take the helm

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:24,630
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it's not a legend!

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,170
When it comes to personal storms,

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,470
simply ride aboard
someone else's biorhythm

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,420
and pretend it isn't there!

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,650
We're going to gather up
all our dreams

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,360
and set out in search
of something to find

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,600
A coin in my pocket,
and do you wanna be my friend?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,860
We are, We are on the cruise!

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,010
We are!

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,470
Gum-Gum...

25
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
...Bazooka!!

26
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,060
Oh, no!

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,100
If I can get my arms and
legs out, the game is mine!

28
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,580
What?!

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,220
This is gonna end it... for sure!

30
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,070
He can be defeated by someone
with a spear of blind determination.

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,590
I know an idiot who's holding back
that spear for a stupid reason...

32
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,560
All... Blue...

33
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,940
I'm the strongest man!!

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,250
Don Krieg... We lost.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
Chief Commander!

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,060
Thanks for everything, Sanji-san.

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,110
When he wakes up, could you tell him...

38
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,100
Maybe... I can live
only a few more hours...

39
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,810
It's kind of stupid that I'm resolved
because I don't have much time left,

40
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,300
but this time, I want to do it with
my own will... in my own way...

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,790
Then, there'll be nowhere
for me to escape, right?

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,580
You don't have to think about stupid
things like fearing your enemy

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,940
or how to keep from getting hurt...
I learned it from that guy.

44
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,120
Well, then! We gratefully
accept the boat.

45
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,880
We don't have to return it, right?

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,850
Right. If you have the courage
to come here to return it,

47
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,170
try it, you small fry.

48
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,500
He's right! Just keep
this in your brain!!

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,780
This is the sea restaurant
Baratie, where cooks fight!

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,440
Hmph! What a scary restaurant...

51
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,440
"Set Sail! The Seafaring Cook
Sets off with Luffy"

52
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,990
Ahh! My hat! My straw hat!!

53
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,660
It's right there.

54
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,160
Huh? Oh, yeah. Here it is.

55
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,720
So you're awake?

56
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,140
Oh? Where're those guys?

57
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,000
They left... thanks to you.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,840
Me?

59
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,890
Ghin said, "I'll see you
again in the Grand Line."

60
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,600
Ghin did?

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,080
To you?

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,520
No, to you!!

63
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,840
Speaking of which,
since I drove them away,

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,760
today is my last day
to do chores, right?

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,770
Congrats.

66
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,530
By the way, will you...

67
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm not going!
I won't become a pirate.

68
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,970
I'll continue to work as a cook here

69
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,890
until I get that damn geezer
to acknowledge my skills.

70
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,620
Okay, then I give up.

71
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,120
Your hand hasn't given up yet!

72
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't leave here...
since they're all undependable...

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,040
But I'm hoping to go some day...
to the Grand Line.

74
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,510
Then let's go now.

75
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,810
It's not the right time yet.

76
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,520
Say... do you know the All Blue?

77
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,660
No...

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,410
Oh, you don't?! It's a miracle sea!

79
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,010
The East Blue, West Blue,
North Blue, and South Blue...

80
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,960
Fish from all those
four seas live in that sea!

81
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,100
To us cooks,
it's a dream-like paradise!

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,980
That's what the Grand Line is like.
So, have you heard...

83
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,230
He looks so happy...

84
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,220
That idiot...

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,420
Guys!! Meal time!!

86
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,610
Aw, man...

87
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,240
We can finally eat!

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,620
Food! Food! Food!

89
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,170
Hey, where do we sit?

90
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,030
Where's our food?

91
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,070
There're no chairs for you.

92
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,260
Sit on the floor and eat.

93
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,570
No chairs? That can't be true!
This is a restaurant!

94
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,670
Guess we can't help it...

95
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,760
They're acting kinda weird...

96
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,890
Hmph! Nothing new...

97
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,850
Hey! Who prepared
the soup this morning?!

98
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,790
Hey, I did it! I did! Isn't it good?

99
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,820
I made it especially good today!

100
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,940
I can't eat damn nasty soup like this!
What is this, pig feed?!

101
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,680
Hey, is human food not to your liking,
you damn racoon dog?

102
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,180
Ha! When it's this bad, it's art now.

103
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,570
It makes me sick to my stomach!

104
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm sorry, but I'm really
confident about today's soup.

105
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,850
There's something wrong
with your taste buds!

106
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,640
Ugh! This is nasty!

107
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,240
I can't eat it!

108
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,690
Right, guys?!

109
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,330
I can't eat something like this!

110
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,980
This is damn nasty soup!

111
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,490
I can't eat soup like this!

112
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,660
This is terrible!
Someone, give me some water!

113
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,030
What do you think
you're doing, you bastards?!

114
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,440
You're a sham Sous Chef after all...

115
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,070
You're just an old-timer.

116
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,370
We're sick and tired of you
settling matters with violence!

117
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,010
If the food's bad, we're gonna say so!

118
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,970
What'd you say?!

119
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,010
We're seafaring cooks.
Don't waste even a drop of soup.

120
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,910
Owner!!

121
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,320
You geezer!

122
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,950
What is this damn nasty soup?
It's like sludge!

123
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,530
If we serve something like this,
our restaurant will go out of business!

124
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,300
Don't be ridiculous,
you damn geezer!

125
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,220
Just how is this soup
different from yours?! Tell me!

126
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,040
From my soup?

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't flatter yourself!

128
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,930
Owner punched him...

129
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,270
He didn't kick...

130
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,590
It'll be a billion years before you can
give me a lecture on cooking, little brat!

131
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,860
I'm a man who has cooked
on seas around the world.

132
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,140
Dammit!

133
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,050
That damn geezer! I... I...

134
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,260
I'm not a "little brat" any more!!

135
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,140
This soup is super good, you know...

136
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,960
We know that.

137
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,460
Huh?

138
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,730
Sanji's cooking skills are
recognized by everyone here.

139
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,820
It's not bad at all.

140
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,420
Yeah, this soup is very well made.

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,120
Boy, that was scary...
He seriously snapped...

142
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,210
Yeah...

143
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,770
But that idiot won't listen
unless we go this far...

144
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,550
Say, kid...

145
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,900
Hm?

146
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,700
You were saying that you wanted
a cook for your ship, right?

147
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,020
This isn't a favor that I'd
like to ask of you or anything,

148
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,590
but would you take that
little brat with you...

149
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,130
...to the Grand Line?

150
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,460
The Grand Line... is his dream.

151
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,140
Man, Owner, you really
made us put on quite a show.

152
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,090
I was worried that he might figure
it out because of your bad acting.

153
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,470
Your acting was horrible, too.

154
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,050
I'll have another bowl of soup!

155
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,810
--Me, too!
--Me, too!

156
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,720
I can hear everything,
you damn idiots...

157
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
So what do you say, kid?

158
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,510
No.

159
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,380
What?!

160
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,150
I thought you wanted
a cook for your ship.

161
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,760
Or are you saying that he's
not good enough for you?

162
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,070
He's good enough, all right.
I do want him to come with me.

163
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,040
But he says that he wants to
continue working here as a cook.

164
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,110
Even if you guys ask me to
take him with me, I can't.

165
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,320
So you're saying that
you can't agree to it

166
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,760
until he tells you so himself, huh?

167
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,630
Exactly. More, please!

168
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,790
Well... fair enough.

169
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,590
But who knows if that twisted
damn brat can just say he'll go...

170
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,000
There's no way he can, since he's
an idiot through and through...

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,970
More, please!

172
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,880
Dammit!

173
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,700
Sanji!

174
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,500
What is he? A fishman?

175
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,310
He came all the way from the
Fishman Island to eat our dishes?

176
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,440
Idiot! It's a human and a panshark!

177
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,970
Hm? What's going on?

178
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,970
Oh? Hey, it's you, Yosaku!

179
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,910
Oh, Big Bro Luffy!

180
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,300
Why are you alone?
Where're the others?

181
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,390
What happened to Nami?

182
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,600
It's not that we caught up with her,

183
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,890
but from the direction
Big Sis Nami was heading,

184
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,730
we figured out roughly
where she was going.

185
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,830
I see... We can bring her back then.

186
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:54,260
Well... If what we're thinking is right,
her destination is a crazy place...

187
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,060
In any case, we need your help,
Big Bro Luffy. Please come with me.

188
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,470
Okay! I don't really get it, but got it.

189
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,130
I'll come with you.

190
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,610
Wait!

191
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,240
Hm?

192
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,410
We both have foolish dreams.

193
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,940
Hm?

194
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,040
In order to achieve
my goal, the All Blue...

195
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,210
Sanji?

196
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
Yeah. I'll come along...

197
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,660
...on your journey to become
"King of the Pirates"!

198
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,600
What?

199
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,090
I'll be the cook for your ship.

200
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,930
Is that okay or not?

201
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,580
It's okay!! All right!!

202
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,170
I'm happy for you, Big Bro Luffy!

203
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,200
Yeah!

204
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,390
Yaay! Yaay! We got a cook!
We'll have good food!

205
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,850
So that's how it is, everyone.

206
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,830
Sorry for causing you
all sorts of trouble.

207
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,020
Ha! I don't like it! I wanted to
kick you out from here myself.

208
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,090
And you decide it so easily?

209
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,050
Sorry for making you
resort to bad acting.

210
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,220
You knew?!

211
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,690
I could hear everything,
since you're all stupid.

212
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,730
What?!

213
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,300
That is to say, you're willing
to go that far to kick me out,

214
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,110
huh, you damn geezer?!

215
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,820
Why do you always have to
talk like that?! You bastard!

216
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,720
Hmph! That's right, little brat!

217
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,730
I don't like kids to begin with.

218
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,990
Not a single day passed
where I didn't regret

219
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,160
letting a useless one live,
you damn brat.

220
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,390
Ha! Fine by me, you damn geezer!

221
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,130
Enjoy the rest of your life to the utmost.

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,400
Whoa! This is a nice ship.
Is it okay for us to use it?

223
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,650
Of course! It's Sanji's boat.

224
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,440
You still need more?!

225
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
Yeah. Give me more meat.

226
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,200
Just how many days
will you be at sea?

227
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,020
Don't know...

228
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,840
Kid...

229
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
Hm? Pops!

230
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
Do you wanna take this?

231
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,080
It's a record of my one-year
journey in the Grand Line.

232
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,030
Don't need it.

233
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,370
I knew it...

234
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,630
I want that marbled meat, too!

235
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,300
Enough already!

236
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,460
Whoa!! Damn geezer,
is this the sea restaurant?

237
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,780
"Baratie Employee Guidelines
1. Serving customers... That is 'love'!
And 'love' means 'restaurant'! 2. Motto! Motto! Service motto!"

238
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,710
For example, Sanji...

239
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,060
Hm? What is it?

240
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,850
Be they arch rogues or jail breakers,

241
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,020
if these damn bastards
badly want to eat

242
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,540
and find their way to this restaurant,

243
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,210
there may be a point in our
continuing to fight at this restaurant...

244
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah!

245
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,630
We're gonna be busy!

246
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,380
We'll be fine 'cause I'm here!

247
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,980
Ah...

248
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,560
Uh! Ow! Ouch...

249
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,400
Geez...

250
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,370
You peeled the skin
too thick, little brat!

251
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,630
That hurt!

252
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,900
When someone's cooking seriously,
you should just watch quietly!

253
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,910
What?! Don't get smart,
you little brat!

254
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,540
I'm not a little brat!
You damn geezer!!

255
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,040
Try this.

256
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,310
Did you make it by yourself?

257
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,670
Yeah.

258
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,680
How is it?

259
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,230
Cripes, this is damn nasty,
you little brat!

260
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,270
You damn geezer!!

261
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,630
Big Bro Cook sure is taking time...

262
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,430
Yeah...

263
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,590
This is for my longstanding grudge!

264
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,780
Be prepared, Sanji!

265
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,120
There's no way you guys
can defeat him.

266
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,110
Let's go.

267
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,310
You don't have to say goodbye?

268
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,910
That's okay.

269
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,850
Sanji!

270
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,460
Don't catch cold.

271
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,670
Owner Zeff!!

272
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,630
Thank you for all the damn things

273
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,150
you've done for me
over all these years!!

274
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,660
I'll never forget your kindness...
for the rest of my life!!

275
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,140
You asshole!!

276
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,230
I'll miss you, dammit!

277
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,080
I'll miss you!!

278
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,670
I'll miss you!!

279
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,300
I feel sad, dammit!

280
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
You idiots!

281
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,290
Men should part without a word.

282
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,460
Let's go!! Set sail!!

283
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,690
I'll see you again, you damn bastards!

284
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,180
As long as you don't fear even death
because you have faith in yourself,

285
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,960
you'll find the All Blue... for sure...

286
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,860
Guys! Customers are
gonna show up soon!

287
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,500
Get to work already!

288
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:24,280
When I was little, I had
a vision of a treasure map

289
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,220
and I always searched
for that miraculous place

290
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,390
before someone else could
beat me to it

291
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,410
If the world is going to change

292
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,410
before I can even attain my dream

293
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,490
then take me to the time
when I knew nothing

294
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:19,870
so that my memories won't fade

295
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,470
It sounds like Nami-san
headed to Arlong Park.

296
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,310
What's that?

297
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,310
It's a place dominated
by fishman pirates.

298
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,650
She couldn't be...

299
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,930
Considering her cuteness...
she might be a mermaid...

300
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,760
A water imp?

301
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,830
I'll kill you!

302
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,250
"Nami"

303
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,690
Then a half fishman?

304
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,730
No meals for you!

305
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,440
Why?!

306
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

307
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,200
"The Worst Man in the Eastern Seas!
Fishman Pirate Arlong!"

308
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,130
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
