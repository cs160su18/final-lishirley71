2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,710
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,170
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,010
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,400
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,610
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,440
He flies around using his Chopper cape

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,020
and fights for world peace!
The name of our hero is...

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,360
...Chopper Man!

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:07,240
"Go, Chopper Man!
Protect the TV Station on the Beach"

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,120
I don't want to hear about no Chopper Man!

43
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,170
He interferes with each and every
attempt I make to conquer the world!

44
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,760
"Evil Incarnate--Dr. Usodaba"

45
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,760
This is Dr. Usodaba, evil incarnate!

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,340
Leading the evil Usodaba Gang,

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,550
he's a fearsome scientist who
schemes to take over the world!

48
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,390
Your less-than-stellar
performance is also to blame.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,190
Quit lazing about!

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,100
Huh?

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,610
"Naughty Monster--Sanjiropus"

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,610
This is the naughty monster, Sanjiropus.

53
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,030
He insists that he isn't naughty,
but he's always thinking about naughty stuff.

54
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,370
I'm not naughty.

55
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,950
Don't lie!

56
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,750
"Rice Ball Monster--Zorokiller"

57
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,750
This is the rice ball monster, Zorokiller!

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,790
He loves rice balls!

59
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,000
He can't stand people who
don't carry rice balls on them.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,170
I can't stand you.

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,300
Guys, try to make yourselves
useful every now and then!

62
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300
--Tea!
--Okay, coming up!

63
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,720
Why am I serving tea?!

64
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,270
Serve your boss tea!

65
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,270
"Matsuhachi"

66
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,020
I just realized something.

67
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,190
My organization is understaffed.

68
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,990
I want higher-level subordinates
who will treat me with respect...

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,490
Amateur Sing Off!

70
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,910
Anyone interested in trying
their luck, please enter!

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,460
This is it! I could use this!

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,170
"Giant Luffybomber"

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,130
Meanwhile, here at
Chopper Man's secret base...!

74
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,170
Have at me.

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,930
What's keeping you? Have at me! Come on!

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,890
"Pretty Assistant--Namifia"

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,890
This is Namifia, a pretty assistant!

78
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,270
Namifia efficiently manages
Chopper Man's missions.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Now bring it on!

80
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,950
Aw, jeez! Please, someone call!
We're in the red this month!

81
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,870
It's no use... Guess we'll have
to cut our grocery budget.

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,950
You're a polar bear?

83
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,830
I'm a panda.

84
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,420
Huh?

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,920
Hey, Namifia! I'm out of potachi!

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,800
Go buy me some more!

87
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,180
"Champion of Justice--Chopper Man"

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,180
This is Chopper Man, the champion of justice!

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,140
He is our hero,
protecting peace around the world!

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,940
Ow, ow...

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,150
That hurt! Why did you do that, Namifia?

92
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,610
This is no time to be laughing
at a TV show, Chopper Man.

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,570
Earth isn't in the least bit of peril today!

94
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,450
Isn't that a good thing?!

95
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:58,330
No, it's not! We're out of the job if
people don't call asking for your help!

96
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,540
All you talk about is business!
But isn't peace on Earth more important?

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,760
Starting tomorrow,
you're grounded from eating potachi.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,510
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,510
--Koala--!
--Now for our next item on the news.

100
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,100
I wonder if there is any juicy bad news.

101
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,390
Like a monster appeared!
Or a robot is going berserk!

102
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,060
Hey! Give the remote back.

103
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,110
--Forget it.
--I wanna watch those comedians!

104
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,610
No!

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,070
All of you in front of your TV sets,
how are you doing?

106
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,240
Usodaba!

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,080
My organization, the Usodaba Gang,
has taken over this TV station!

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,040
Great! There's a crisis!

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,500
What's he doing on TV?

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,420
There is but one reason why
we came to this TV station!

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,340
I have a declaration for all
those currently tuned in!

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
In order to conquer the world,
my Usodaba Gang...

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,810
...is currently recruiting people
who would like to join our ranks!

114
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,810
What?

115
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,640
Join now, and no entry fees!

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,150
No annual conference fees!

117
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,860
And that's not all!

118
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,270
I will present the most
extraordinary of our applicants

119
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,440
with my organization's secret treasure.

120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,150
It's fast! It's strong!

121
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,700
But it's a model, so you can't ride in it.

122
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,370
We'll present the Air Force C Mach 2!

123
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,210
I had to stand in line for a week to get this.

124
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,620
I really don't want to part with it,

125
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,840
but I'm woefully giving this away!

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
It's the Air Force C Mach 2
Limited Edition Version?!

127
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,180
Now, you in front of the TV!
Join the Usodaba Gang right this instant!

128
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,310
This is bad! Chopper Man, it's time for action!

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,510
Right!

130
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,930
You know what your mission is, right?

131
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,640
Of course I do!

132
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm going to join the Usodaba Gang!

133
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,190
You don't know after all!

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,650
Air Force C Mach 2 Limited Edition Version!

135
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,190
I am extremely worried...

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,820
That's right!

137
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,280
--We've got the Giant Luffybomber!
--Bomber!

138
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,490
If I used that...!

139
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,870
"Giant Luffybomber"

140
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,870
It's gone!

141
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, yeah... I sold it just the other day...

142
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,300
What do you think, Robiflowern?

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,590
Wasn't I overflowing with
charisma when I was on TV?

144
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,300
Yeah, well, more or less...

145
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,220
"Flower Monster--Robiflowern"

146
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,220
This is the flower monster, Robiflowern.

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
She's an evil woman

148
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,520
who's been defeated by Chopper Man's
killer "Cute Spark" time after time.

149
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,690
Do you guys see me in a
somewhat better light now?

150
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,570
--Huh?
--Don't laze around during our strategy meeting!

151
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,370
--Tea!
--Okay, coming up!

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,120
I did it again!

153
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,500
Serve your boss tea!

154
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,500
"Matsuhachi"

155
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,500
It's okay. If this plan is a success,

156
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,340
high-level subordinates will flock to me...

157
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,960
Usodaba-sama, you're wonderful!

158
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,010
Usodaba-sama, you're a genius!

159
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,300
Usodaba-sama, have some tea!

160
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,720
But hijacking the airwaves was a good idea...

161
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,850
...for you, anyway, Usodaba-sama.

162
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,560
That was one word too many, Robiflowern.

163
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,190
My plans are always perfect!

164
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,940
If I get it across on TV that my
Usodaba Gang is strong and cool,

165
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,150
I bet people wanting to join
will come flocking in droves!

166
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,280
When that happens,
world domination will be as easy as pie!

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,450
And then those two will get the boot.

168
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,790
But what type of show will you put on?

169
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,290
I'm glad you asked!

170
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,550
First, we'll start with my enchanting voice.

171
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,220
"Super Star"

172
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,850
Sorry for the wait!

173
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,890
Just leave this to me!

174
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,520
I'll make all of the women in front
of the TV swoon with my charms.

175
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,310
Please watch, Robiflowern-chan!

176
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,520
S-Sure...

177
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,900
It's not my fault if you have to start sharing me.

178
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,700
I wonder if this is a good idea.

179
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,780
It's fine. Let him perform,
Robiflowern. He's the opening act.

180
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,790
Go wait in the Call Center for incoming
calls from people wanting to join!

181
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Very well.

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,290
I see it! I can see it!

183
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,300
The Call Center will be abuzz

184
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,510
with interested viewers
from across the country!

185
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,680
"Cooking for 30 Hours with Sanjiropus"

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,680
Cooking for 30 Hours with Sanjiropus!

187
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,470
Huh?

188
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,480
Hello! I'm the cooking
monster of love, Sanjiropus!

189
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,190
Today I'd like to introduce
you to a super-easy recipe

190
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,480
that uses leftovers in your fridge.

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,530
Almost like magic, I'm able to
transform any old leftovers...

192
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,990
...into dishes like this within three minutes.

193
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,450
What?! From those ingredients?!

194
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,950
Now for the key point!

195
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,080
For the remaining 29 hours and 57 minutes,
I will gaze at no one but you...

196
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,510
Stare...

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,400
Stare...

198
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,190
What are you doing?! The food got cold!

199
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,150
That's the problem?

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
It can't be helped.

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,490
We really do need my enchanting--

202
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,700
Something-or-Other Giri!

203
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,490
Outta the way!

204
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,250
I'll prove that I'm the strongest.
Now shut up and watch.

205
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,460
"Rice Ball Samurai"

206
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,340
What?

207
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,590
No!

208
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,340
Let's have fun and play, Missy!

209
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,510
Save me!

210
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,970
Screaming won't get ya anywhere.

211
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,600
Stop right there!

212
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,480
Who're you?!

213
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,350
Who cares? Get him!

214
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,530
Lost by a hair...

215
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,820
Ow, ow, ow...

216
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,290
P-P-Please spare me!

217
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,000
Bastard, do you have any rice balls?

218
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,210
What?!

219
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,300
Make sure you have some from now on!

220
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,720
Um, excuse me!

221
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,180
"Fin"

222
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,310
That didn't make sense!

223
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,730
Damn it! At this rate, my plan will be in ruins!

224
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,900
Hey! Please let me join.

225
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,730
Oh, someone finally came!

226
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,610
--Hiya!
--It's you!

227
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,450
Please let me join your gang. I want the model.

228
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,570
Air Force C Mach 2 Limited Edition Version!

229
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,290
In your dreams! I'd never give my
beloved collection to you, my enemy...

230
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,210
Wait a second.

231
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,960
Come on! Please!

232
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,130
Shall I throw him out?

233
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,420
No, wait.

234
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,800
Hey, you!

235
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,170
Do you want this?

236
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
I want it! I want it!

237
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,510
Then it's yours.

238
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,970
Really? Yay!

239
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:12,350
In exchange, fight me and lose in a
pro-wrestling program that I planned out!

240
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,310
That's my condition.

241
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Huh? I have to lose?

242
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,900
I hate losing...

243
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,730
You're only pretending to lose.

244
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,490
Don't you want the Air Force C
Mach 2 Limited Edition Version?

245
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,990
I'm only pretending, right? It's a deal!

246
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,620
Great! Take him to the dressing room!

247
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,460
--Dabada!
--Yay! I'm going to be on TV!

248
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,790
Usodaba-sama?

249
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,300
If I defeat Chopper Man in
a fight in front of the cameras,

250
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,800
no one will question whether my
organization--no, I am the strongest!

251
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,430
Makes sense!

252
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,020
Just you watch!
The main event is about to begin.

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Everyone around the country,
thank you for waiting!

254
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,330
Today's main event is
Usodaba versus Chopper Man!

255
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,080
We're broadcasting live from a special ring

256
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,960
in the globe-shaped observation deck.

257
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,680
"Wind"

258
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,300
I will be the ring announcer, Shorts.

259
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,970
We have invited Minoru Kazeno-san
to be our commentator.

260
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,680
It's a pleasure!

261
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,510
--Usodaba!
--We already have a pumped-up
Usodaba in the ring.

262
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,060
Everyone across the nation!
Before today's match,

263
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,600
I'd like to present you with
one of my wonderful songs.

264
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,850
Music--

265
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,230
Oh! At last, Chopper Man
has entered the stadium!

266
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,690
Yay! Namifia, are you watching?

267
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,950
Chopper Man!

268
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,990
With his cape glistening in the blue sky

269
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,030
All that cheering doesn't
make me happy or anything!

270
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,000
It's him! He's coming this way

271
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,790
Uh, guys...

272
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,540
"Wind"

273
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,540
As expected, the crowd is
going wild for Chopper Man!

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Working to defend the...

275
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,080
Enjoy letting it get to your
head while you still can!

276
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Today is the day I'm going to pulverize you.

277
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,720
Usodaba Lock!

278
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,260
Ow, ow. That hurts!

279
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,890
You're taking this too far.

280
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,060
Keep quiet and let me beat you!
Don't you want that?

281
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,680
"That"?

282
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,480
The Air Force C Mach 2 Limited Edition Version!

283
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:31,780
"Wind"

284
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,150
Well, Usodaba got the first strike, Kazeno-san.

285
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,450
Chopper Man isn't exhibiting his usual power.

286
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,820
I wonder what's wrong...

287
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,280
It really is a one-sided fight.

288
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,120
Hiya!

289
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,450
Ow, ow, ow!

290
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,330
Take this!

291
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,830
Thrum!

292
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,010
No one could have expected
the match to turn out like this!

293
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,430
"Wind"

294
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,760
Usodaba is overwhelmingly powerful.

295
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,430
He's good.

296
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,970
Dang, Chopper Man's weak!

297
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,850
What a letdown.

298
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,680
In comparison, Usodaba is putting
up a surprisingly good fight.

299
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,190
Usodaba! Usodaba!

300
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,730
Usodaba!

301
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,360
Usodaba! Usodaba!...

302
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,150
It looks like Usodaba's popularity
is suddenly skyrocketing!

303
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,410
Uh, testing, testing.

304
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,030
Hello? Is this the reporter, Sanjiropus-san?

305
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,000
The Call Center is getting
flooded with people saying,

306
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:23,040
"Call Center"

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
"I want to join the Usodaba Gang."

308
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,290
At last!

309
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,250
At last, my time has come!

310
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,130
Hey, can we stop now? I want
to take the model and go home.

311
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,340
Hang in there for just a bit longer!

312
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,760
I'm about to wind this up.

313
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,010
I'm seriously going to crush you.

314
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,850
Oh, no! Usodaba has climbed onto the top rope!

315
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,480
Chopper Man is in serious trouble!

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,810
"Wind"

317
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,150
Will tonight be the birth of a new, dark hero?

318
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,730
This will finish him off.

319
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,780
But first, I'd like to sing a song!

320
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,250
My Air Force C Mach 2 Limited Edition Version!

321
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,540
Is it all right?

322
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,380
Phew! It's still fixable.

323
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,050
Thank goodness...!

324
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,670
Thank goodness!

325
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,340
Gimme.

326
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,340
--No way.
--Eh?

327
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,430
Wasn't that the deal?

328
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,770
That deal? I never intended
to go through with that!

329
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,390
Dumb deer!

330
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,850
Wh-What...?

331
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,030
Right now, I'm more popular than you!

332
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,690
It's all going according to plan!

333
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,820
But I worked so hard...

334
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,200
Go on, everyone!
Let's hear you call for Usodaba!

335
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
Not yet!

336
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,830
--Dabada!
--This match isn't over yet!

337
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,790
Hmph! You're being a poor loser.

338
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,330
Killer move!

339
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,920
Cute Spark.

340
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,130
Ah, this is...

341
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,590
Cute Spark!

342
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,920
--Cute, cute, cute!
--Allow me to explain!

343
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,880
--Cute... Spark!
--Chopper Man can melt the heart

344
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,060
--Cute, cute, cute! Cute! Cute?
--of anyone who sees his killer "Cute Spark."

345
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,970
Cute!

346
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,940
Vroom, vroom! Vroom, vroom, vroom! Cute?

347
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,110
He's totally aware of how cute he is!

348
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,820
I won't lose! I won't lose to you!

349
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,900
Chopper Man! Chopper Man!

350
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,860
--Chopper Man! Chopper Man!...
--Wh-What's this?

351
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,320
D'aw, Chopper Man is so adorable!

352
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,660
Go away, Usodaba!

353
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:30,630
"Wind"

354
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,500
The stadium has flipped 180 degrees.
Chopper Man is the crowd favorite!

355
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,630
Let's share some of the
feedback we've received.

356
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,000
"Call Center"

357
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,670
Uh... "Chopper Man, good luck!
Don't let Usodabo beat you."

358
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,010
I'm Usodaba!

359
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,470
"Don't lose to Long-nose."

360
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,680
At least say my name!

361
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,510
At any rate, everyone's really excited over here!

362
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,010
Whose side are you on?!

363
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,970
--Damn it!
--Chopper Man, let me tag in!

364
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,640
Become the wind.

365
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Hey! Why are you tagging in?!

366
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,150
I won't forgive you for bullying Chopper Man!

367
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,490
Uh oh! Minoru Kazeno
suddenly entered the fight!

368
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,410
I'll just have to pull out my ultimate weapon!

369
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,830
Click.

370
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,370
What's that?

371
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,330
Hey, look outside!

372
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,210
Cyber!

373
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,960
"Giant Robot--Frangashan"

374
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,960
This is the giant robot, Frangashan!

375
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,970
This is Dr. Usodaba's latest secret weapon.

376
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,380
Its true strength is unknown!

377
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,890
Go, Frangashan! Destroy everything!

378
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,350
Okay!

379
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,850
Leave this to me!

380
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,980
Flick.

381
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,020
See? I really am the strongest!

382
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,030
Gotcha!

383
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,190
Gah! That's--!

384
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,120
"Giant Robot--Luffybomber"

385
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,120
This is the giant robot, Luffybomber!

386
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,790
It's a giant robot that's 50 meters tall.

387
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,160
Personality: It does its own thing!

388
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,670
I came to save you. It came at a high price.

390
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,760
I expect you to pay me back!

391
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,920
Namifia!

392
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,090
Damn it! Frangashan, do something!

393
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,800
Bring it on!

394
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,110
Here I go!

395
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,110
Hey, here he comes!

396
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,610
Yeah!

397
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,070
Go, Frangashan! Huh?

398
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,870
S-Stupid! Stop that!

399
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,870
What are you going to do?

400
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,950
Upsy daisy.

401
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,500
It lifted up the globe!

402
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,170
Hey! There are a bunch of people in here!

403
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,710
Wow, everyone was quick to flee.

404
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,170
Here I go!

405
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,510
You're pretty good...

406
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,020
Sweet!

407
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,270
I'm falling!

408
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,310
Huh?

409
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,860
Stupid! Let go! No, don't let go!

410
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,490
Take this! Feel my wrath
for not giving me that model!

411
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,990
Chopper Violence!

412
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,790
Cheers for a good day at work!

413
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
Oomph.

414
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,040
A word, please!

415
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,210
Man! That applause doesn't
make me happy or anything.

416
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,970
In the end, this just boosted his popularity.

417
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,100
Damn it! I'll get you for this!

418
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,980
This one really put us in the red, but...

419
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,150
He certainly is beloved!

420
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,070
That's it!

421
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,240
Hello. This is the office for
the Chopper Man Fan Club!

422
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,320
Oomph!

423
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,030
You'd like to know where
to submit the entrance fee?

424
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,370
--Just one moment please.
--There!

425
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,700
Amazing! We're making a fortune!

426
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
Hey, how many of these do I
have to sign before I can stop?

427
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
You have to sign all of those today.

428
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,340
In exchange, I'll buy you that model
plane if you get them all done today.

429
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,760
Really?! I'll do my best!

430
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,100
--In a sense, the assistant Namifia
was the strongest of them all.
--There! There! There! There!...

431
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,480
Yes, hello?

432
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,730
--Go! Don't lose, Chopper Man!
--There! There! There!

433
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,440
There! There!

434
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,150
Well, next we're entering haunted waters!

435
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,330
Granny Kokoro warned us, but I wonder
what type of ghosts are there.

436
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,540
Indeed, I wonder what type of ghosts are there!

437
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,870
Yeah! I'm really looking forward to this.

438
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,500
Say, who're you?

439
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

440
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,340
"Plunging into the Devil's Sea!
The Mysterious Skeleton Floating in the Fog"

441
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
