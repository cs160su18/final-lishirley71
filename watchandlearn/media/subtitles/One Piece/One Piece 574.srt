00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,450
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World, the
second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:07,380
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,080
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,380
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
turned to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,970
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,700
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,270
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,350
where they instigated an all-out war
against the New Fish-Man Pirates.

78
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,880
Luffy finally defeated
Hordy in a fierce fight

79
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,950
and thwarted his plot.

80
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,790
All right! Spread the sail!

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,170
Let's set sail!

82
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,010
Take me out for a fun stroll again!

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,430
I want to go to a real forest above ground!

84
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,600
Okay, fine!

85
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,480
I'll take you there next time!

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,270
We promise!

87
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,070
Once we pass through this deep sea,

88
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,740
we'll get to the ultimate sea!

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,790
Let's go!

90
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,330
Guys!

91
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,040
To the New World!

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,620
"To the New World! Heading
for the Ultimate Sea!"

93
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,830
After leaving the Fish-Man Island,

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,410
the ship ascends toward the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

95
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,760
--It's going very well!
--Yeah, almost too well.

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm starting to get hungry. Let's do it now!

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,710
Wait until I finish making this, Luffy.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,970
How nice!

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,010
It's called Shower Tempo.
Do you wanna use it?

100
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,060
Oh? Me?

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm okay. I just brushed myself 2 days ago.

102
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,110
By the way, doesn't that
cloud look like cotton candy?

103
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,960
You can't eat it!

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,820
Oh yeah? It's not sweet, sweet cotton candy?

105
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,710
What? There is something sweet
and yummy in the bathroom?

106
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,270
Oh yeah! Looks pretty sweet and yummy!

107
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,340
Nami-san, please! Turn around!

108
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,010
Chopper, step away from the cloud.

109
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,560
How scary!  I don't wanna
eat that cloud anymore!

110
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,940
It's so relaxing!

111
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,620
My first bath on the Sunny in 2 years!

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,710
It's so luxurious with a view of the deep
sea - it's as beautiful as the night sky.

113
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,370
Don't they need you on the deck?

114
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,300
It's okay. I'll go up before
we ride an upward current.

115
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,000
If a sea monster strikes,
they can take care of it.

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,920
Hurry up, Usopp!

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,070
Just one minute.

118
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,470
We want a giant fish so
the ropes gotta be strong!

119
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,020
Okay, I think this is good.

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,890
Finished!

121
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,300
Ta-dah!

122
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh? You guys are having fun.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,880
I hadn't even thought about it
on our way to the Fish-Man Island

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,460
because I was excited to see the island

125
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,030
but if we catch a deep-sea fish
now, Sanji can cook it for us!

126
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,950
I hope it'll go with cola!

127
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,530
Cook, huh? That's a good idea!

128
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,490
Can't wait to have a drink in
celebration of entering the New World!

129
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,410
Now, which one should we catch?

130
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,090
I want something that looks yummy!

131
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,680
That one would taste good
fried up with some salt!

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,560
A fried fish with salt sounds good!

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,100
How about slicing it in half and grilling it?

134
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,390
Like an eel, huh?

135
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,940
Oh! That one looks good too! It
would be yummy with some mayonnaise!

136
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,230
Which one?

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,750
No, it doesn't look good at all.

138
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,720
No matter how you cook
it, it won't taste good.

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,290
You think so? Well, whatever's fine with me!

140
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,210
Second Gear!

141
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,170
I'm sure Sanji can cook up any fish!

142
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,000
Gum-Gum...

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,880
...Jet Pistol!

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,610
I knew you wanted that one!

145
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,890
Hey, isn't it a little too big?!

146
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,600
Hurry, hurry! Catch it!

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,060
Special Attack - Capture Star!

148
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,320
Yeah!

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,860
We got a deep-sea fish!

150
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,120
I wanna eat it already!

151
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,490
Are you sure it's a fish?
Looks like an old man!

152
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,780
An old man?

153
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,370
It got eaten!

154
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,600
Hey, hey, not again! They keep coming!

155
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,140
Reel it in already, Usopp!

156
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,260
I can't, I can't! The
ship is gonna flip over!

157
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,840
I can't believe this! Is it a Russian doll?

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,630
Do you think something happened?

159
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,680
The ship is shaking and  I
hear them yelling on the deck.

160
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,560
I shouldn't have trusted them!

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,940
One-Sword Style - 360 Pound Phoenix!

162
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,150
Nice, Zoro!

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
What's going on here?

164
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,780
Hey Sanji, look at that!

165
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,050
I see! That's great!

166
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,210
A deep-sea fish, huh? Can't wait to cook it!

167
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,320
Well, first of all, how did you get burned?

168
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,420
Listen to this! You won't believe it!

169
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,550
There are 2 more fish inside that one!

170
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,690
But, is the ship really moving forward?

171
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,330
It feels like we're sinking...

172
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,810
No way!

173
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,230
What is that?!

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,350
What?

175
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,540
It's a giant sea snake! No!!

176
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,310
Alright, get closer! Let's eat that too!

177
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,030
We have too much to carry already!

178
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,990
Wait! Don't tell me it's...

179
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,650
Whitestrom!

180
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,840
It's a giant whirlpool that appears
out of the blue in the deep sea,

181
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,420
like a living dragon!

182
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,300
What?

183
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,510
A whirlpool in the deep sea?!

184
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,230
What the hell is that?! This
is dangerous, isn't it?

185
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,430
Damn, those fools!

186
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,270
What?! Oh no! It must be the Whitestrom!

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,520
When a ship gets caught up in the whirlpool,

188
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,700
it'll end up somewhere far
off usually missing its crew.

189
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,750
What?! That means the crew
all died, doesn't it?

190
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,370
This is dangerous! Let's get away!

191
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,260
A ship will end up somewhere far off?

192
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,370
So it's like the wormhole of my dreams?!

193
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,120
No, it's not, you fool!

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,760
Guys! We have to get away
from that whirlpool now!

195
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,180
There! Our navigator's back! Let's go, fools!

196
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,700
Augh! What is that fish doing there?!

197
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,310
Oh, we caught it!

198
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,150
What do you think you're doing?! We
can't advance if we're pulling that!

199
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,480
See? The fish got caught in the whirlpool!

200
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,320
--No! Get it back!
--Yeah!

201
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,740
No! We're gonna cut it loose!

202
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,820
What?! We wanted to eat the deep-sea fish!

203
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,880
Which is more important to
you - the fish or your life?!

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,500
How could you get in this much trouble
while I was away for only 10 minutes?!

205
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,960
Franky, Coup de Burst?!

206
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,840
No, it's super too late for that!

207
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,550
--Huh?
--Stop "Huh?"-ing me!

208
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,310
We're gonna get caught in the whirlpool!

209
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,930
We're in big trouble!

210
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,270
Oh no!

211
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,300
--It's too late!
--I don't wanna die!

212
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,940
Hold onto the ship!

213
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,450
How fun!

214
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,990
This is super not good!

215
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,340
Even the Sunny can't endure
a whirlpool this wild!

216
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,630
I blame Luffy and the rest of you!

217
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,210
My head is spinning!

218
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,640
Can't we get out of the whirlpool somehow?!

219
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,690
There are no records of someone
escaping the Whitestrom! Because...

220
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,610
No one has ever survived!

221
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,650
Instead of the New World,
we're all going to hell!

222
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,070
It stopped.

223
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,070
The Sunny was not destroyed.

224
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,490
We hit something and got
bumped out of the whirlpool.

225
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,300
In any case, we're alive!

226
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,700
Where are we?

227
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,180
What's this black wall?

228
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,960
It doesn't seem like the Red Line.

229
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,220
A ghost!

230
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,140
What is it?

231
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,060
It's gonna eat us!

232
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,660
A monster!

233
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,710
What is that?!

234
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,880
It's going away!

235
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,020
A fin? Don't tell me it's...

236
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,480
I can hear it singing. It must be...

237
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,820
Wow, it's a pod of whales!

238
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,030
Oh, those scars!

239
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,220
We'll come back to see you again.

240
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,260
When I come back, let's fight again!

241
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,060
Laboon?!

242
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:40,500
Laboon! Wait for us! We'll come
back here for sure...! For sure!!

243
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,540
Laboon! You got so much bigger!

244
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,590
Don't be ridiculous! Laboon should be
in the first half of the Grand Line.

245
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,260
He's gigantic! He can't fit
through the hole in the Red Line!

246
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,860
Amazing!

247
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,720
It's like a miracle to come
across a pod of Island Whales.

248
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,270
Some of them have scars like Laboon.

249
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,190
Yeah, the scars look the same! I can't
believe it! But it's not Laboon?!

250
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,320
Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!

251
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,910
Laboon! Stop! Listen to me!

252
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,120
It's me from the Rumbar Pirates! Brook!

253
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,160
Come to your senses!
That's a different whale!

254
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,530
Laboon!

255
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,510
We're not on a whale watching crew!

256
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,500
It's still dangerous out here!

257
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,300
Now, let me call the roll to make sure
no one got lost in the whirlpool!

258
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,130
--Nami-san!
--Yes!

259
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,380
Robin-chan!

260
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,100
Here.

261
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Okay, we gotta get out of here now.

262
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,650
The ship will be destroyed if
those giant whales crash into us!

263
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,330
Why didn't you call our names?

264
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,570
Sanji-kun! Six more of us
are alive and well here too!

265
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,200
Nami-san, what should we do?!

266
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,350
Let's not do anything.

267
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,780
Yeah, we shouldn't do anything,
fools! Let's watch the whales now!

268
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,290
What's wrong with you?!

269
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,330
Since they're such giant whales,
they're creating a current.

270
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,250
It'll be dangerous to go against it!

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,140
Tighten the sails!

272
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,760
Turn the ship in the direction
that the whales are heading!

273
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,140
Okay!

274
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,890
Oh yeah! This is where Laboon came from.

275
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,670
Are any of you related to him?

276
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,190
Be careful, Brook!

277
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,430
Is anyone looking for a calf
who got lost 50 years ago?

278
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:37,610
Don't worry! He's doing okay
on the other side of the world!

279
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,090
According to Luffy-san, he's very big now.

280
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,250
So please don't worry!
I think Laboon would...

281
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,050
Catch the stream!

282
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,880
Okay!

283
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,100
We're okay now.

284
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,750
We'll stick with the whales for a while.

285
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,180
That's kind of nice.

286
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,240
Oh? Brook?

287
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:17,490
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

288
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:26,200
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

289
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,580
Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!

290
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,590
Sea wind blows to where, who knows?
The waves will be our guide!

291
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,240
O'er across the ocean's tide,
the sunset is goin' wild

292
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,350
See the sky! Birds singing
in circles passing by!

293
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,850
Bid farewell to weaver's town!
Say so long to port renowned!

294
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,110
Sing a song, it won't be long
before we're casting off!

295
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,320
Cross the gold and silver waves,
changin' into water sprays!

296
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Sailing out on our journey
to the ends of the sea!

297
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,740
Gather up all of the crew!
Time to ship out Binks's Brew!

298
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,000
Pirates we, we'll divide
and conquer all the seas!

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,380
With the waves to rest our heads,
ship beneath us as our bed!

300
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,800
Hoisted high up on the mast
our Jolly Roger flies!

301
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,880
Somewhere in the endless sky,
a storm has started comin' by!

302
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,970
Waves are dancing having fun,
it's time to sound the drums!

303
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,970
Hey, you're giving us a ride?

304
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:31,230
If we let blow winds of fear,
then the end of us is near!

305
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,980
Let him take us!

306
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,230
Looks like they're gonna go upward too!

307
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,900
Even so, tomor-row the sun will rise again!

308
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:43,430
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

309
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:52,980
Yo ho ho ho… Yo ho ho ho…

310
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,380
It's the New World, the final sea
of the Grand Line, up above us!

311
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,850
I can't wait!

312
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,890
Luffy?

313
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,460
That's it!

314
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,700
Finally!

315
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,600
Let's do it, guys!

316
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,480
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

317
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,320
...5, 4, 3, 2...

318
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,030
...1!

319
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,460
--We're out!
--In the New World!

320
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,300
--We did it!
--We finally made it!

321
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,110
But it's not time to celebrate yet!

322
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,810
Oh, the whales!

323
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,310
We'll tell Laboon about
you all if we see him!

324
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,030
Laboon's relatives! Take care of yourselves!

325
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,450
Thank you for everything!

326
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,530
I had heard about it but
it's more than I expected!

327
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,420
The New World has...

328
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,440
…really bad weather!

329
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,800
The sky is filled with thunder!

330
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,720
The wind is so strong!

331
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,590
The sea is very rough!

332
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,550
The needle is going crazy!

333
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,520
I see some ships!

334
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,940
Pirates are having a party!

335
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,320
No, those are warships!

336
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,440
Couldn't ask for anything better!

337
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,990
The Navy?

338
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,460
The Straw Hats finally
make it to the surface.

339
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,560
They encounter many grueling trials...

340
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,890
...including a mysterious girl small
enough to fit in the palm of you hand.

341
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,550
However...

342
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,890
...it also brings to light a conspiracy...

343
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,180
...between pirates and the
Navy of the New World!

344
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,720
On the next episode of One Piece!

345
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,020
"Z's Ambition!
Lily the Little Giant!"

346
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
