00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,470
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,390
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,270
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,240
The words he uttered just before his death

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
drove people around the world to the seas.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,380
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,090
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,620
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,110
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and set out in search of something to find

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,380
ONE PIECE!

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,770
Compasses only cause delays

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,820
Delirious with fever, I take the helm

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:24,110
If the dusty treasure map has
been verified, it’s not a legend!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,430
When it comes to personal storms,

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,550
simply ride aboard someone else’s biorhythm

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,990
and pretend it isn’t there!

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,830
We’re going to gather up all our dreams

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,330
and set out in search of something to find

22
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:56,590
A coin in my pocket,
and you wanna be my friend?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,280
We are, We are on the cruise!

24
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
We are!

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,940
Wealth, fame, power...

26
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,720
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,160
The words he uttered just before his death

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,870
drove people around the world to the seas.

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,400
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,830
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,190
The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!

34
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,400
He slipped away from my Hair Bind!

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,620
Rumble...

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm sorry, Doctorine.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,490
Just like Doctor put his life on the
line in order to save the country...

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,410
...I want to put my life on the
line in order to save my friend.

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,370
If I'm gonna die anyway, I'll do it!

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,590
Just please, nobody come into this room.

41
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,440
"Bubble Master Kalifa!
The Soap Trap Closes in on Nami"

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,740
Yo...

43
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,250
Yoyoi...

44
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,970
I don't know what's going on,
but the way you firmly stand like a devil...

45
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,430
I like it, my friend!

46
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,120
Whether you're a devil or a demon-god,

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,260
a real man wouldn't withdraw even a step!

48
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,400
On my honor as Kumadori the lion,

49
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,810
I'll bring you down!

50
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,610
Shave!

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,530
Finger Pistol! Q! Q! Q! Q! Q!

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,420
Moon Walk!

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,710
Shishi Kabob!

54
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,430
Y-Y-Yoyoi!

55
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,510
N-Now that it's come to this,
I'll use my specialty attack!

56
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,660
Take this! Life Return!

57
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,370
Hair Bind!

58
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,870
Hair Bind!

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,730
H-Hair Bind!

60
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:45,110
My God! My consciousness,
all the way to the tip of my hair,

61
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,950
is screaming that the best thing
to do here is to run away.

62
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,110
Even so, please don't stop me, Mother!

63
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,880
A man... A man...

64
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:09,840
A man has battles that he must face head-on!

65
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,300
Shave!

66
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,270
Tempest Kick! Lotus!

67
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,440
Take this! Song of Willow!

68
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,640
Dammit!

69
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,020
I'm super this week, and yet I still
had a harder time than I thought.

70
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,980
But, well...

71
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,230
...I got his key.

72
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,360
#4...

73
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,870
The key the swordsman and
the nose wanted was #2, right?

74
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,330
This guy had #4.

75
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,010
That guy had #3.

76
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,200
And there's only one left.

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,880
The one who has the #2 key
is that secretary woman!

78
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,480
I'd better hurry up.

79
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,760
I'll go help them out!

80
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,580
You guys don't have much time, right?

81
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,070
I thought you weren't going to go easy on me.

82
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,580
Did I hear you wrong?

83
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,630
How dare you mock me?!
I won't let you get away with it!

84
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,670
Then, bring it on.

85
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,930
You don't have to wait. The battle
has already started, you know.

86
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm surprised that a power holder
could take a bath in front of her enemy.

87
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,440
If your body is halfway submerged,
you shouldn't have full use of your powers.

88
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,610
Are you saying that I'm
leaving myself wide open?

89
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,930
You don't have to worry about it,

90
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,620
because just like me, you can't
exert your strength, either.

91
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,120
Pardon me for a bit.

92
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,130
What'd you do to me?!

93
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,270
Isn't solving a mystery like that one of
the true joys of fighting a power holder?

94
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,690
It was definitely this woman
who put Sanji-kun in that state.

95
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,320
I have to be careful. Or there's no
point in me taking his place to fight.

96
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,590
The strength that ebbed away
is coming back little by little.

97
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,920
I'll show you the power
of the Perfect Clima Takt!

98
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,130
You're mistaken if you think
I'm just a cute beauty!

99
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,010
I can move my legs, too!

100
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,250
Here I come!

101
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,810
Thunder Charge!

102
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,010
Swing Arm!

103
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,000
That's an amazing weapon.

104
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,670
These are...

105
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,380
...clouds?

106
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,230
There's no way I'd just lay on
the floor doing nothing, is there?

107
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,390
Thunderbolt... Tempo!

108
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,910
It's your own fault for acting so confident.

109
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,020
That was a surprise.

110
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,020
I never thought I'd be hit by lightning indoors.

111
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,760
What was that thing that
guarded you from the lightning?

112
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
It turned into bubbles and disappeared.

113
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,450
You have no chance against me
unless you solve that mystery.

114
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,120
I wonder if you can do it.

115
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,600
It was as if soap turned into bubbles.

116
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,790
A soap human with
Bubble-Bubble Fruit powers...

117
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,820
I wonder if it's something like that.

118
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,160
B-But even if, for example, you figured
out what kind of powers they are,

119
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,150
it's not like you have a
chance to win! How insolent!

120
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,220
So that was right on the mark.
Now I kinda feel guilty.

121
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,720
You're right. My selling point is cleanliness.

122
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,850
I ate the Bubble-Bubble Fruit

123
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,440
and became a soap human
whose entire body lathers.

124
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,360
Isn't it wonderful?

125
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,490
Whoa! How sexy! To be honest,
I'd be happy to have a secretary like her.

126
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,820
Hey! What am I, a middle-aged guy?!

127
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,160
But isn't that poorly suited for fighting?
That doesn't look very strong.

128
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,490
But I can freely manipulate the
bubbles that come out of my body.

129
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,920
What? What's going on?

130
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,410
I'll show you.

131
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,630
The bubbles from the bathtub are...!

132
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,010
Bubble Master!

133
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,890
Soap Sheep!

134
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,190
This is...

135
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,650
How's this? Isn't it wonderful?

136
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,860
You're an idiot, aren't you?

137
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
You shouldn't be deceived by my appearance.

138
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
What?

139
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,070
Sheep Cloud! Relaxing Bubbles!

140
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,080
You did lose your strength at the
entrance of the room. Why was that?

141
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,980
That's right...!

142
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,820
That must've been her powers, too.

143
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,940
Bubbles!

144
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,960
Come to think of it, when I
stepped into this room...

145
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,430
...there were bubbles all over the floor!

146
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,720
Shoot!

147
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,020
You noticed it too late.

148
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,040
My strength is ebbing away.

149
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,490
This happened earlier, too, because I
stepped on the bubbles on the floor.

150
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,490
You'll learn the horror of
this power little by little.

151
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,050
The bubbles that come out of my
body scrape away all sorts of things...

152
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,820
Obviously filth and spots, but also
your strength, among other things.

153
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,980
And I don't want you to forget that I'm
an assassin from a secret organization.

154
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,860
I can move my body! Her kicking
me made the bubbles go away!

155
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,070
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

156
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,120
Thunder Ball!

157
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,130
That weapon's power alone...

158
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,500
...is still an unknown quantity to me.

159
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,570
My strength is ebbing away.

160
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,980
This happened earlier, too, because I
stepped on the bubbles on the floor.

161
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,910
You'll learn the horror of
this power little by little.

162
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,500
The bubbles that come out of my
body scrape away all sorts of things...

163
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,330
Obviously filth and spots, but also
your strength, among other things.

164
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,430
And I don't want you to forget that I'm
an assassin from a secret organization.

165
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,350
I can move my body! Her kicking
me made the bubbles go away!

166
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

167
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,610
Thunder Ball!

168
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,740
That weapon's power alone...

169
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,990
...is still an unknown quantity to me.

170
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,370
Golden Bubbles!

171
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,380
What're you doing?!

172
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,900
I can't stand!

173
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,670
What?! What's wrong with my legs?!

174
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,260
They look pretty, don't they?

175
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,390
Everything I touch gains a beautiful gloss.

176
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,310
I'll make your skin shiny...

177
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,560
Every inch of your body.

178
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,540
Iron Body!

179
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,780
I don't know what's coming next,

180
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,280
so I'm gonna go ahead
and replenish my cola first.

181
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,990
Come to think of it, I wonder
how that deer's doing.

182
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,660
What the heck's going on?!

183
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,180
Wh-What the hell...

184
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,140
...is this?!

185
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,860
That's the CP9 guy who was in the fridge!

186
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,980
What?! Did this monster bring him down?!

187
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,990
What the hell is this?

188
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,380
I feel like that deer was
wearing the same kind of hat...

189
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,840
Hey! You're not that deer-gorilla, are you?!

190
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,570
Hey... This can't be happening...!

191
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,750
There's no mistake.

192
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,320
Kumadori-san!

193
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,580
He flew from the Tower of Law?!

194
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,790
Can't be...! Who on earth could...?

195
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,380
Seriously... what the hell is he?!

196
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,890
A voice...?

197
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,600
Hm?

198
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,820
Hey, hurry up!

199
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,780
Why are you stopping, Nico Robin?!

200
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,490
Hey, are you listening, you woman
whose very life is a crime?!

201
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,450
Hey, Lucci! Drag her along!

202
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,450
Grab her by her hair!

203
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,750
It's an order.

204
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,520
Get moving, Nico Robin.

205
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,870
Don't tell me... you still think that the
Straw Hats are coming to your rescue?

206
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,020
How stupid!

207
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,360
Are you seriously still laying your
hopes on such weak-looking pirates?

208
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,220
That explosion earlier was
surely just our imagination.

209
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,490
There's no way that they can come here!

210
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,330
While you're enjoying your little dream,
we'll pass the Gates of Justice.

211
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,870
"Underground passage
(current location)"

212
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,080
The Bridge of Hesitation lies
in front of the Gates of Justice.

213
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:40,380
"Bridge of Hesitation
(halfway)"

214
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,500
First we'll cross half of the bridge.

215
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,390
When the gates are opened,
the other half will rise from the sea,

216
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,800
"Gates of Justice
(cross-section)"

217
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,030
and we'll finally go through
the Gates of Justice.

218
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,830
Once the gates are closed again,

219
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,020
you'll never have the feeling of hope...

220
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,100
...ever again.

221
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,360
The only feeling you'll have is a sense of guilt.

222
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,700
You'll endlessly atone for your
sin of having lived until today.

223
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,900
Right, Nico Robin?

224
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,930
Now, let's hurry.

225
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,900
Come on already!

226
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,820
Robin!

227
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,450
Wh-Wh-What was that?! I just heard a voice!

228
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,170
Hey! What was that voice?!

229
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,840
Chief, please take Nico Robin
and hurry on ahead.

230
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,690
Hm? Doors?

231
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,100
They don't look like iron this time.

232
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,700
Hm? The space has opened up. Where am I?

233
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,990
There you are! Pigeon guy!

234
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm glad you came.

235
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,920
Hey! Come in, CP9!

236
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,760
A pirate strayed in!

237
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,180
Geez... Hey, are you listening?!

238
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,140
Wait! What you're holding is...

239
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,140
Hm?!

240
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,690
Ahhh! I pressed the button on
the golden transponder snail!

241
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,030
On the next episode of One Piece!

242
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,470
"Resounding Bad News! Buster Call Invoked!"

243
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
