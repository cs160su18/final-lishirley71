00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,260
Ah! My hat!

22
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,430
Wait!

23
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,340
Wait, hat!

24
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,520
Good! My hat!

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Hm?

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,260
Wow! So this is the scenery
that the King of Pirates saw...

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,000
Wow...

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,850
Finally... Finally the time
for revenge has come.

29
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,540
Just wait, you damn Straw Hat!

30
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,290
He finally showed up...
Took him long enough.

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,340
Please wait... Captain Smoker!

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,760
Come with me, Tashigi.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,750
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,600
"Buggy's Revenge! The Man Who
Smiles On The Execution Platform!"

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,640
Hey, someone's on
the execution platform!

36
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,930
Who the heck is that?

37
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,200
That old man said
that it was 22 years ago

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,970
that the King of the Pirates died here...

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,040
Hey you over there!

40
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,320
Come down right away!

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,590
Why?!

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,330
That's a special execution platform
under control of the World Government!

43
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,680
Come down right now!

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,560
Well, you don't have
to be so strict, officer.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,770
If you don't come down,
I'll just arrest you. I'm coming up now!

46
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,690
Hmph! Now's not
the time for small fries.

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,370
Hm?

48
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,220
I've been looking for you, Luffy.
Long time no see...

49
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,040
Huh?

50
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,890
Don't tell me you forgot my face...

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,240
How beautiful...

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,300
She's so pretty!

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,230
She is a woman of unrivaled beauty!

54
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,770
Her skin looks very smooth.

55
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,340
I don't know anyone like you.
Who the heck are you?

56
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,320
I'll never forget you...
because you're the first man who hit me.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,660
What? I hit you?

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,070
When your passionate
fist hit me that time...

59
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,660
Gum-Gum...

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,950
Pistol!

61
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, it felt good...

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,550
You guys... what's the most
beautiful thing in the East Blue?

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,510
That'd be you!

64
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,690
That's right. It's me.

65
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,060
There's no man in this world that
doesn't bow before my beauty.

66
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,020
And I like strong men.

67
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,490
I'll make you mine, Luffy.

68
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,090
Shut up! No way!
Who the heck are you?

69
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,450
You still haven't figured it out?

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,870
This is the police!
Hey, woman, come quietly!

71
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,850
You're under arrest for
harming the police captain!

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,470
And you over there!
Get off the execution platform!!

73
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,260
Oh? Who'd you say you'd arrest?

74
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,020
Y-You!

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,970
Are you capable of that?

76
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,540
A-Asst. Captain, this is a problem!
She's beautiful!

77
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,820
So what?! We'll arrest her!

78
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,050
She's so beautiful
that she's dazzling!

79
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,700
Good for you!

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,090
Terrorist bombing!!

81
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,580
It's heading straight for her!

82
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,020
Wh-What the...

83
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,470
The fountain slipped!

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,840
What just happened?!

85
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,290
That was dangerous, you know.

86
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,060
Flashily sorry. But your smooth skin
is unharmed, of course. So don't worry...

87
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,380
...beautiful lady Alvida.

88
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,950
Huh? Alvida?

89
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,970
I don't see Alvida.

90
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,230
I'm Alvida! You blockhead!

91
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,610
Really? You don't
look like Alvida at all...

92
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,540
I changed after eating a devil fruit.
The name of the fruit is...

93
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,780
Smooth Smooth Fruit!

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,760
No attack can hurt my skin
because it slides off it.

95
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,550
Unfortunately, my beauty
couldn't be improved that much, though.

96
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,340
One big change was...
yes, my freckles are gone.

97
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,510
N-No, that's not really what I meant.

98
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,440
After becoming a new person,

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,150
I joined forces with him since we
had the same goal-- finding you.

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,840
Now, the ultimate star
appears super flashily!

101
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,930
Monkey D. Luffy!

102
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,920
Since the day you blew me off, I've
been obsessed with revenge on you.

103
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,640
That alone led me to finally find my crew.

104
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,970
It was indeed a great adventure.
I was missing parts of my body.

105
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,310
Laughs. Hell. Friendship. It was
tiny Buggy-kun's great adventure.

106
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,980
But Buggy-kun was...

107
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Why am I telling you
a story, you bastard?!

108
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,320
What? Well, what was your name?

109
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,990
Boggy? No, Boogie?
No, Behie... isn't right...

110
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,380
Oh yeah! It's Buffoon!

111
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,160
Buffoon?! Stop messing around!

112
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,670
You sure haven't lost
your nerve, you moron!

113
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,710
I-It's Buggy the Clown!

114
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,040
P-Pirates!!

115
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,580
It's the Buggy Pirates!!

116
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,230
People! Remain flashily where you are!

117
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,100
I'll show you good how scary I am.

118
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,360
Oh! It's Buggy!

119
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,800
You just remembered it?!

120
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,460
Wh-What's going on?

121
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,630
Long time no see, rubber man.
Is Roronoa Zoro well, too?

122
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,490
Okay, Cabaji. Good job.

123
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,420
To my several hundred billion
servants around the world! Look!

124
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,490
We'll now super flashily
start the open execution!

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,550
Monkey D. Luffy! You can
no longer move even an inch.

126
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,020
You feel honored, Straw Hat?!

127
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,840
You can die in the same place
the King of the Pirates died.

128
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,290
The atmospheric pressure
is dropping abnormally.

129
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,830
I've never seen such
a bizarre drop before.

130
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,570
Now that you mention it,
I feel a strange wind...

131
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,950
A storm is coming... to this island!

132
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,290
A-A storm?

133
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,290
We'd better hurry back to
the ship or we'll be in trouble.

134
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,780
Is it a pretty big one?

135
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,470
Hey...!

136
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,790
Hm?

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,290
Zoro!

138
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,080
Have you seen him?

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,460
You mean Luffy?

140
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,390
Yeah... We got separated.

141
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,820
I also feel something strange...

142
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,850
...like... something terrible
is about to happen...

143
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,940
Pirates're here!

144
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,230
Pirates're here!

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,170
Pirates're here!

146
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,910
Run!

147
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,690
It's Buggy the Clown!!

148
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,320
What?!

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,650
Buggy the Clown!

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,660
What? Then...

151
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,590
Y-Yes! In addition to Straw Hat Luffy,
Buggy the Clown and Iron Club Alvida,

152
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,000
all notorious pirates in the East Blue,
are taking over the square!

153
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,530
Right under my nose...

154
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,220
What impudent jerks...

155
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,110
What should we do,
Captain Smoker?

156
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,680
Send Unit #1 to the sea.

157
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,600
Unit #2 is to secretly surround
the square from the streets.

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,310
And have the rest stand by within
shooting range of the square.

159
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,770
That's all.

160
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,560
Yes, sir!

161
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,620
Give this order to Unit #1.

162
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,120
Yes, sir?

163
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,570
"Crush any pirate ships
as soon as they see them.

164
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,440
Don't let any pirates off of
this island. Not even one pirate."

165
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,110
An execution!

166
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,270
An execution will start!

167
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,560
Buggy the Clown will be
executing Straw Hat Luffy!

168
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
Luffy's gonna be executed?!

169
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,140
That idiot!

170
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,270
Let's go!

171
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,390
Take care of this!

172
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,660
Ahh... Ahh... Ahhhhh...

173
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,050
S-S-S-Sanji!

174
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,150
Treat it like a lady! Got that?!

175
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,520
Oops! Ahhh...

176
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,520
We have to hurry, too!

177
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,640
Hey! Hey, Nami!
Where're we going?!

178
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,540
The harbor, of course!

179
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,060
H-Harbor? Oh yeah, of course!

180
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,010
Captain Smoker!
Please come here.

181
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,040
Things are getting weird.

182
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,610
Hm? Wha...! Th-That kid...

183
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
What's he doing?

184
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,590
Monkey D. Luffy. This can't be!
Looks like he's about to be killed!

185
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,540
How pathetic that kid looks!

186
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,920
I want to see the place where
the King of the Pirates died!

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,130
Hm?

188
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,180
He was somehow
different from the others.

189
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,340
He caught my attention...
So I thought, but...

190
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,540
Does this mean that he's just
another pirate after all?

191
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,920
Captain, are we
swooping in right away?

192
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,310
Idiot. Don't be hasty.

193
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,150
But if we don't hurry...

194
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm the one in command here!

195
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,040
Y-Yes, sir!

196
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,920
A pirate is about
to kill another pirate.

197
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,360
This is great.
They're saving us the trouble.

198
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,660
Listen! Once that
Straw Hat's head falls,

199
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,650
surround Buggy,
Alvida and their gangs!

200
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,980
Don't give them time to think!

201
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,410
Pirate Monkey D. Luffy, the criminal,
is to be flashily executed for the crime

202
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,110
of getting me angry
by becoming stuck up!

203
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,900
Live it up flashily!

204
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,530
This is my first time
seeing an execution.

205
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,920
We're executing you.

206
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
Huh?

207
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,530
What?! Stop joking!

208
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,060
You stop joking!

209
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,940
Take this board off!! You bastard!!

210
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,940
Okay! We are now going

211
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,040
Take it off!! You liar!
You jerkwad! You stupid head!

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,040
to start the flashy execution openly!!

213
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,440
Ahhh!! Stop it!
Ahhh! I don't wanna die!!

214
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,000
I saw a big cumulus
cloud in the eastern sky.

215
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,840
A storm is coming.
An unimaginably big storm is...

216
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,460
If Buggy, Luffy and the others
go crazy, the Navy will come out.

217
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,460
We're done for if the ship is washed out
to sea when we have to get out of here.

218
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,580
I see. That really is a big deal!

219
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,870
The Navy may have
already started taking action.

220
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,970
The Going Merry is in danger!

221
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,340
Th-The Going Merry
will be in the Navy's hands?

222
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,030
H-Hey, Nami! Hurry up!!

223
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,660
Wait for me!

224
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,640
Hurry to the harbor!
Crush every single pirate ship!

225
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,600
Yes, sir!

226
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,980
Riding around on the Richie bike!

227
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,940
Who's that man?
Who? Who? Who's that man?!

228
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,050
Me!

229
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,390
So this is the rubber guy's ship...

230
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,990
He now has a bigger ship,
as if he's become a real pirate.

231
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,880
It's about time for him to get
flashily executed by Captain Buggy.

232
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,250
However...! Just in case the rubber guy,
who has no chance of escaping,

233
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,110
happens to escape,
burning this ship is... our job.

234
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,850
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
Please save me.

235
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,140
Why would I save you, idiot?!

236
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,820
Hmph! This is what happens
when someone goes against us.

237
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,640
I guess this is it for
the man I had my eye on...

238
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,600
Since you have a big audience,

239
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,060
do you wanna say
something before you die?

240
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,670
Well, that's okay. Whether you
wanna say something or not

241
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,530
doesn't matter since you're gonna die.

242
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!!

243
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,170
Wha...

244
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,810
K-King of the Pirates, he said?!

245
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,010
In this town, of all places...

246
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,950
That's a crazy thing to say...

247
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,100
Well then, I guess I'll do it now...
you damn piece of rubber.

248
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,410
Stop...

249
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,030
Hm?

250
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,260
...the execution!

251
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,660
Hm?

252
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,360
Zoro! Sanji!

253
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,830
Zoro?!

254
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,840
Hm?

255
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,900
Shame on you!

256
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,280
There's a limit to how much
you can fool around, Luffy.

257
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,710
If you're starting a sideshow,
let me join you.

258
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,930
What we have to do for now is
drive those damn pirates away?

259
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,300
P-Pirate hunter Zoro!!

260
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,130
Sanji! Zoro!

261
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,480
So you're here, Zoro!
But you are a little too late!

262
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,630
We'll bring down...

263
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,640
...that execution platform!

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,210
Roronoa Zoro...

265
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,770
Guys... get them!

266
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,410
We'll get them!

267
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,180
Big Sis Alvida!

268
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,760
Out of our way!

269
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,920
Not even Zoro can stop me now!

270
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,260
This is the end of your captain!!

271
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,270
Damn bastard!

272
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,990
If I cut down the execution platform...

273
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,840
Listen. The moment Monkey D. Luffy's
head falls, we'll attack all together.

274
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,040
All units. Get ready for battle.

275
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,350
Yes, sir!!

276
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,050
Zoro! Sanji!

277
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,260
Hurry up!

278
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,260
Usopp!

279
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,470
Nami!

280
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,470
This is heavy!

281
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,150
Sorry. I'm... dead.

282
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,510
Idi...

283
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,150
Don't say something so stupid!

284
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,730
He smiled!

285
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm still alive after all.

286
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,850
I got lucky.

287
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,620
H-Hey, do you believe in god?

288
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,620
Phew, lucky me.

289
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,530
Stop talking nonsense. Let's
get out of this town already!

290
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,530
I was worried what was
going happen for a while.

291
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,070
Another trouble seems to be brewing.

292
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,750
Now! Corner those pirates!

293
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,700
Yeah!!

294
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,390
Here they come!

295
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,830
Tsk!

296
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,390
Amazing! Amazing!
It's somehow gotten crazy!

297
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,790
Amazing! Ahh! Amazing!

298
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,630
Hey, Luffy!

299
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,530
Ahhh... Z-Zoro!

300
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,880
This is no time to be excited!
We need to get out of here!

301
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,130
We'd better hurry back to the ship

302
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,100
or we'll never be able
to leave the island.

303
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,500
We won't be able to
enter the Grand Line!

304
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,350
What?! That's not good!

305
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,590
The Straw Hat gang is running away!

306
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,560
Capture them!

307
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,860
Go after them!

308
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Why did he smile?

309
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
Did he know he'd be saved?

310
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,430
No. At that moment, he seriously
thought his life was going to end there.

311
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,980
He accepted death and smiled
after preparing himself.

312
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,370
Captain, please go seize the pirates.

313
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,520
Hey... have you seen any pirates
who smiled on the execution platform?

314
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,950
N-No way! Even if it's
a brave-acting big shot,

315
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,350
at the moment of death,
he turns pale and dies in despair.

316
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,470
That straw hat man smiled...

317
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,410
...just like Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates,

318
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,740
smiled 22 years ago in this town...
on that execution platform...

319
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
Captain...

320
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,730
Where did that Straw Hat go?

321
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,140
Yes, sir. He's running towards the sea.

322
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,080
What's Unit #1 doing? They should've
blown up their ship by now.

323
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,990
Well... They're back for
refitting because they couldn't

324
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,430
light the powder
due to the sudden rain...

325
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,040
What?!

326
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,360
A reserve unit is currently getting
ready to attack the ship instead.

327
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,740
Captain Smoker! If we let them sail
out now, they'll enter the Grand Line!

328
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,540
The wind is blowing towards the west.
It's a tailwind for their ship.

329
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,970
Are these all coincidences?

330
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,950
It's as if heaven is trying
to let that man live.

331
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,190
We'd better hurry
or we'll be in trouble!

332
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,730
We're gonna make it to
the Grand Line like this!

333
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,930
I am White Hunter Smoker.

334
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,660
On my honor as a
Navy Headquarters Captain,

335
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,350
I won't let that man
leave this island!!

336
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,250
Wind, blow!

337
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,400
The storm of fate has arrived!

338
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

339
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

340
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

341
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

342
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

343
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

344
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

345
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

346
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

347
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

348
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

349
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,140
I'm alive! Everything's okay!

350
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,640
We need to set sail right away or
the clothes I bought will get wet!

351
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,280
My elephant tuna had better be okay!

352
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,480
I can't stand this Tashigi woman.

353
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,440
Hey, guys! Stick with me!

354
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,970
Let's go to the Grand Line!

355
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,000
On the next episode of One Piece!

356
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,960
"The Legend Has Started!
Head For The Grand Line"

357
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
