Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,000
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,570
The words he uttered just before his death

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,790
drove people around the world to the seas.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,330
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,420
Find it!

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,840
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,860
Now everyone is in search of romanticism!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,560
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

Make waves, jump from your sleep

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,210

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,830

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
WE GO!

68
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

69
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,690
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:07,370
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,040
The New World has ruined many
pirates' dreams and ambitions.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,340
and his friends venture into that sea.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

75
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,650
On their way to the New World,

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,440
Luffy and his crew reached the Fish-Man
Island located 10,000 meters below sea level,

77
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,860
where the New Fish-Man Pirates who are
looking to destroy the Ryugu Kingdom...

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,370
...assisted by Vander Decken, who is after
Shirahoshi, are engaging in secret maneuvers.

79
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,080
The Straw Hats find themselves
caught up in the turmoil

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,080
while Zoro, Usopp and Brook get
captured by Hordy at the Ryugu Palace.

81
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,670
Get out of my way, Jimbei!
You gotta let me go!

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,170
No, I won't! Leave it up to me!

83
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,180
You bastard!

84
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,220
Then I'll just beat my way past you!

85
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,730
I'll fight you as many times as
I have to till you understand!

86
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,650
What did you say?!

87
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh, I see some soldiers from the army!

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,850
Water Shot!

89
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:17,500
"The Battle is on!
At Conchcorde Plaza!"

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,010
Captain Hordy is awesome-ch!

91
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,140
I can't believe that he was just writhing in
agony from an Energy Steroid overdose-ch!

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,500
N-Neptune's army's been beaten!

93
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,760
They got wiped out!

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,260
Exactly how strong is Hordy?!

95
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,970
Minister of the Right-dono!

96
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,220
Minister of the Left-dono!

97
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,600
Neptune-sama!

98
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,100
King-sama!

99
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's go to Conchcorde Plaza!

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh no, Neptune-sama!

101
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,170
Neptune-sama!

102
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,010
We were almost...

103
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,810
...almost there!

104
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,570
Your efforts were expected to bear
fruit at the World Summit this year!

105
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,570
Queen Otohime!

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
But then they started this all of a sudden!

107
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,740
Please save him!

108
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,290
If nothing is done, they will kill King-sama!

109
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,170
Please! Please save the King!

110
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,060
Mom!

111
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,660
What's gonna happen to this country?!

112
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,850
Captain! Hey Captain!

113
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,890
Captain Decken,
things will start looking up soon.

114
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,730
You fool! I don't need you to comfort me!

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,320
You guys don't know how painful
it is to be broken-hearted!

116
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,030
I mean, Shirahoshi was
just a kid when we first met.

117
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,790
And I decided to marry her to
fulfill my ancestors' dream!

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,910
And how did it all turn out?

119
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,010
You're not my type!

120
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,150
"Not my type" she said When the words came
to my ears I felt my true love grow, I suspect.

121
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,820
A haiku with extra syllables.
By Vander Decken IX.

122
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,400
She broke... She broke my heart!

123
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,540
I was dumped so I cut my hair!

124
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,710
Only the top?!

125
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,250
I wanted to kill her but she's still alive!

126
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,420
I know it because I still
can throw things at her!

127
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,760
That Straw Hat fool must be protecting her!

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
Oh yeah.

129
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,020
What's wrong?

130
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,900
I got an idea!

131
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,570
What don't I just destroy
everything altogether?!

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,070
It's gonna be great!

133
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,570
Let King-sama go, Hordy!

134
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,340
Stop! Or we'll open fire!

135
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,690
Run, soldiers! Don't die a
meaningless death-jamon!

136
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,610
I won't let them get away-ch! Sea Bear!

137
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,050
Dammit!

138
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,790
Finally, you're here! I got tired of waiting!

139
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,370
Hyouzou-san, we're here!

140
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,620
Don't get too close! He'll cut you!

141
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,170
I'm here as you wish-dokan!

142
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,800
You folk have nowhere to... run!

143
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,870
We can't get in! The entrance
to Conchcorde Plaza is locked!

144
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,410
Neptune-sama!

145
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,160
Let's climb the wall!
Maybe we can see inside.

146
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,490
Boy, he gave me a lot of trouble...

147
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,120
We've wasted so much time.
Let's go, Princess-sama.

148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,330
Okay!

149
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,290
Take care of Hachi, Camie!

150
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,750
Y-Yes.

151
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,170
Go, Megalo!

152
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,470
I thought you soldiers had
to protect this country!

153
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,810
Soldiers...

154
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,820
Hordy!

155
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,910
That soldier is up to something.

156
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,910
Which one?

157
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,630
He's gonna launch a suicide attack
to kill anyone around him-bokan!

158
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm gonna become a piece of
dried squid if he does-ch!

159
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,550
Before the Princes gets here,

160
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,100
if I can kill at least one of their officers!

161
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,850
Oh no, he's gonna...

162
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,230
Water Shot.

163
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,580
What's that? How far can it go?

164
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,650
MERMAID COVE

165
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,940
--What is that?
--Huh?

166
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,610
I hear something.

167
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,270
Hey, I thought the Water Shot
was fairly weak, wasn't it?

168
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,120
I know you took a lot of Energy
Steroid but still, that was great-ch!

169
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,410
Your hair turned white
and you've gained muscle.

170
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,870
How do you feel, Captain?

171
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,630
Couldn't be better!

172
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
The soldiers...

173
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,190
Why didn't they wait for us?

174
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,340
Fukaboshi! Ryuboshi! Manboshi! Be careful!

175
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,090
All the sea monsters and the
Fish-Men have taken the drug!

176
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,180
I thought Neptune's army

177
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,050
wouldn't be beaten so easily as long
as playing field was level-re-mi-fa!

178
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,140
We'll save you, Father!

179
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,710
Why don't you understand, Hordy Jones?!

180
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,550
You folk are the weakest on this island!

181
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:22,010
The other islanders were trying to ignore
the history of discrimination by humans

182
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,520
and to forgive the murder of their hero
and queen who died at the hands of a human.

183
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,980
They endured their pain in
order to change the future

184
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,560
and signed their names.

185
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,610
--Prince!
--Fukaboshi-sama!

186
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,740
Why can't you appreciate the boldness
and kindness of their decision?

187
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
Kindness?

188
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,410
It's a meaningless gesture.

189
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,830
You all want to be fooled by the humans?!

190
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,260
Merman Combat!

191
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,880
Spear of the Ages!

192
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,550
Seven Great Treasures!

193
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,100
Dragon Tower Gate!

194
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,690
Th-They beat the sea monsters!

195
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,900
You folk are just seeking your
revenge out of your own hatred!

196
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,120
But I won't let you take the King's life,
or the island that belongs to our citizens...

197
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,120
...or the Ryugu Kingdom!

198
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,050
They're so strong! After all,
they're the strongest men in the Kingdom!

199
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,720
You think you win because
you beat the sea monsters?

200
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,190
We won't lose! Because we were
given the great power from above!

201
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,150
That power will allow us to
rule the real Fish-Man country!

202
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,990
We'll beat you all and lead the way to
peaceful coexistence with the humans!

203
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,790
If we let you have your way,

204
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,540
Fish-Men and humans won't get another
chance at friendship for hundreds of years!

205
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,250
Say whatever you like! But after all,
this country will be ruled by...

206
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,340
...the winner, right?

207
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,670
They look strange!

208
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,710
Here they come!

209
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,340
Wh-What the...

210
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,890
Too slow.

211
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,960
Hurry up, Megalo!

212
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,300
Father-sama, please be safe!

213
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,510
He will be fine! It's going to be alright!

214
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,320
So that was the true power of the drug!

215
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,300
Attempting to free Neptune,
Shirahoshi and Jimbei

216
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
but they are caught in Hordy's trap.

217
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,220
Displaying his prisoners, Hordy affirms
his complete control of Fish-Man Island.

218
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,810
and reveals a surprising, long-hidden truth!

219
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,190
On the next episode of One Piece!

220
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,730
"A Surprising Confession! The Truth
Behind the Assassination of Otohime!"

221
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
