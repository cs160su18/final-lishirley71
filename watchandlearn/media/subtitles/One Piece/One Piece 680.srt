Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
We are the one! Go ahead!

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,070

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,390

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340
Force it and go

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,930
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Get dragged into darkness, Straw Hat!

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,710
I'll never lose!

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,370
I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,100

go - that's the adventure

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,010
Let's go, Shining! Running! Forever

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,040

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

67
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,570
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,710
turned to rubber after
he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

71
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,380
and his friends venture into that sea.

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,480
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,080
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law and have come to Dressrosa

75
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,000
but Law has been captured by Doflamingo.

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,960
Luffy snuck into the Royal Palace
to take back Law.

77
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,200
Meanwhile, the toys who turned
back to their original forms

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,740
channel their anger towards Doflamingo.

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,210
Who are those bastards?!

80
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,690
--Look! He's a Doflamingo operative!
--Thank you for turning us into toys!

81
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,390
Take him down together with the factory!

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,010
The fighting competition
came to a surprising end

83
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,260
and the mystery man who were disguised as Lucy
finally disclosed his identity.

84
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,950
Who are you really?

85
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,020
Me?

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,260
My name is Sabo.

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,320
We're members of the Revolutionary Army.

88
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,120
What? Then, the first Lucy, too?!

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,370
The first Lucy has a bounty of 400 million.

90
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,440
He's the man who'll become
the King of the Pirates someday!

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,090
Straw Hat Luffy!

92
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,410
A pirate?!

93
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,930
Yeah, he's my brother. Take good care of him!

94
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,680
At the same time, Luffy finally comes face-to-face
with Doflamingo. However...

95
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,580
Tra-guy!

96
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm here to save you!

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm glad that you're alive!

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,540
Oh, the stone guy!

99
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,250
Pica!

100
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,220
I never thought I'd be taken in like this.

101
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,880
Mingo's alive!

102
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,430
It's a difficult situation.

103
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,170
I have no choice but to use the "Birdcage."

104
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,320
The Birdcage?!

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,170
Right, Law?

106
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,560
"The Devil's Trap!
A Dressrosa Extermination Plan!"

107
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,960
Where's Doflamingo?!

108
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,410
Take everything away from him!

109
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,360
Destroy the factory as well!

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,050
THE SMILE FACTORY

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,740
What should we do?!
The ex-toys are coming to...

112
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,030
...raid the factory!

113
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,990
Well...

114
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,900
Nobody can get in here
unless they have a key to the door!

115
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,520
This factory means everything
to the Young Master!

116
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,190
Even if the ceiling collapses,
there won't be a single scratch

117
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,880
because the buildings are
made of Sea Prism Stone.

118
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,620
And more importantly...

119
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,610
Those two top executives are on guard now!

120
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,970
It's no use!

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
Lock!

122
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,080
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

123
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,460
Don't push your luck, you scum!

124
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,100
Stick-Stickem!

125
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,910
Nobody can take down those two!

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,290
This factory has
an impregnable two-pronged defense!

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,290
We need to do something immediately.

128
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,960
Creepy!

129
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,890
How are you still alive, Doflamingo?!

130
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,510
Do you want me to teach you...

131
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,590
...how to kill a person?

132
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,260
Soldier!

133
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,560
Brother Kyros!

134
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,870
This is how you do it.

135
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,090
Kyros!

136
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,910
Straw Hat!

137
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,030
There are two Young Masters!

138
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,430
Pentachromatic Strings!

139
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,080
Sorry! I dropped my guard!

140
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,330
Gum-Gum...

141
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,490
Armament!

142
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,200
...Jet Gatling!

143
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,370
Luffyland!

144
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,930
What is that clone?!

145
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,900
That hurts!

146
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,540
It's like a marionette made of strings!

147
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,220
I've never seen such a technique!

148
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,920
King Riku.

149
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,790
Do you remember the feeling you had
on that night 10 years ago?

150
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,400
The day you sliced up your dear citizens
and burned down peaceful towns.

151
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,010
Please stop!

152
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,760
If there's no preventing me
hurting the citizens...

153
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,070
I'd rather be dead!

154
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,340
Somebody, please...

155
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,490
...kill me!

156
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,550
I still have nightmares of it every night!

157
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,400
Yes, I remember it! So what?!

158
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,340
The tragedy that will unfold soon
will not be small-scale like that.

159
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,920
Don't be ridiculous!

160
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,580
What are you planning?!
I don't ever want to see such...

161
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,680
Now it's time to let you guys go.

162
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,190
Pica!

163
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,090
Throw these nuisances out!

164
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,180
Doflamingo!

165
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,220
Don't cause harm to...

166
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,400
...this country anymore!

167
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,660
Gum-Gum Balloon!

168
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,660
Now, let's bring an end to everything.

169
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,010
He threw us out into
the garden of the Rampart Tower!

170
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,910
We can't get near Doflamingo
as long as Pica is there!

171
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,830
I-It's started...!

172
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,580
The Birdcage!

173
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,660
Captain, what's that?!

174
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,110
How do I know?!
Let's get off of the island now!

175
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,490
Even if we stay here and hurl
our anger at Doflamingo,

176
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,750
we'll just be crushed in return!

177
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,050
Captain! Watch out! Something's there!

178
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,420
Ouch!

179
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,240
A-Are they blades?

180
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,230
What are these bars?

181
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,000
It didn't work! We can't break it down!

182
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,120
What the hell is that?!

183
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,010
The Birdcage?

184
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,750
What do you mean by that, Tra-guy?!

185
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,630
Before the truth behind
this country is exposed,

186
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,640
Doflamingo is going to...

187
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,860
...kill everyone on the island!

188
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,080
What?!

189
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,280
There's a fence all over as far as I can see!

190
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,140
Where is the exit?!

191
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,910
What is that-dara?

192
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,870
Vice Admiral Bastille!
I can't reach the Headquarters!

193
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,580
The same here!
I can't make contact with the base!

194
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,760
We haven't reported anything yet!

195
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,950
This must be...

196
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,310
Hey! What did you shoot somebody's house?!

197
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,630
I-I didn't want to! I can't control my body!

198
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,690
Hey! Stop!

199
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,700
Wh-What the...?! M-My body's...

200
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,340
Daddy!

201
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,390
Stop me! Please duck, everybody!

202
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,370
Parasite String!

203
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,670
Help!

204
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,560
What the hell is going on-dara?!

205
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,160
Sir, I have report!

206
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,900
There are people causing

207
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,200
harm to others randomly
in different parts of Dressrosa!

208
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,010
Some of us Navy soldiers
are running wild, too!

209
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,050
If nothing is done, many citizens will die!

210
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,480
What is it this time?!

211
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,560
Th-The King's Plateau is sinking down!

212
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,770
H-H-Hey! The ground is descending!
What's going on?!

213
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,370
It's Pica!

214
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,050
Since he can merge with stones,
he can even shift the geography!

215
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,030
The Royal Palace is going somewhere!

216
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,400
Stop, Royal Palace!

217
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,210
The factory is going up!

218
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,120
What?! What the hell is happening here?!

219
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,000
Somebody!

220
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,750
Please stop me!

221
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,460
The plateau of the Flower Field is...

222
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,180
...rising up and pulling in the whole town!

223
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,820
Clank.

224
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,670
Citizens and guests of Dressrosa.

225
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,110
I could have reigned over you all
with terror from the start.

226
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,400
After finding out the truth,

227
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,970
I bet a great number of you want
to kill me now.

228
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,470
That's why I prepared a game for you.

229
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,400
It's a game to kill me.

230
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm in the Royal Palace. I won't run or hide.

231
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,690
If you can take my life,

232
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,760
the game ends there, of course.

233
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,500
But there is another way to finish the game.

234
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:44,140
Here is how. You kill all the
people that I'm going to name now.

235
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:50,530
Also, I will award a large prize
for killing each one of them.

236
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,320
Kill or get killed.

237
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,300
Everyone in this country will become hunters!

238
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,600
The only way for you to survive is...

239
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,030
to kill somebody!

240
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,320
The all-out battle at the Colosseum was
only a beginning!

241
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,180
Now, the whole of Dressrosa has

242
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,160
become a battlefield and the
horrifying, life-or-death game is on!

243
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,980
Faced with an extreme situation where
citizens turn violent and try to kill him,

244
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,670
Luffy moves to take down Doflamingo!

245
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,690
On the next episode of One Piece!
"The 500 Million Berry Man! Target: Usoland!"

246
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!
