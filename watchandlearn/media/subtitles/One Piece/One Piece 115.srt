00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people
seek the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future --
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright,
but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,550
I'm really really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really
need everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:19,050
"North Block"
"West Block" "South Block" "East Block"

22
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,370
The feelings of those who are in anguish

23
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,670
are crushed by a dry cloud of sand.

24
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,250
There are those who seek hope,
and those who cling to hope.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,650
Their feelings cross each other,
uncertain what to do,

26
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,320
marking an era of history ending in sadness.

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,860
There are those who would prevent war,

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
and those who would incite war.

29
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,400
Many different sensibilities
have gathered at Alubarna.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,920
Among them, at this very moment,
were Usopp and Chopper,

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,450
whose battle against Mr. 4 and
Miss Merry Christmas was unfolding.

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,890
Will Alabasta fall?

33
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,930
Or will it find true peace?

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,140
Moment by moment, the goddess
of fate marks the final hour.

35
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,640
"Big Opening Day Today!
The Copy-Copy Montage!"

36
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,980
Don't you lie to us, you haggy old mole!

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,150
There's no way he can be dead!

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,590
There's no way he'd be beaten
by that sand-gator bastard!

39
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,320
I'd think you'd need
some grounds for saying

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,590
that there's no way it could happen.

41
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,370
He's the man who will be
king of the pirates someday!

42
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,430
That's why there's no way he
can get his ticket punched here!

43
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,980
K-King of the pirates?

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,210
"King-er-ates"? "K-rates"? "K"?

45
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't make me laugh!

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,350
I wouldn't tell that foul story
in the Grand Line, ever again!

47
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,360
Man, I'm glad he's dead!

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,220
He was a stupid bastard,
who didn't know his own place!

49
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,920
A "ba"! He was a "ba"!

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,050
Listen up, Chopper!

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,030
A man...

52
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,310
It's about time for
you to die, longnose!

53
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,430
Molehill Highway!!

54
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,240
...n-no m-m-matter how d-deathly
h-hideous his foe may be...

55
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,000
See you in hell!

56
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,440
Mole-Mole Impact!!

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,700
Usopp!

58
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,950
...n-no matter...

59
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,120
...how slim a chance
he has at beating them...

60
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,170
Mr. 4!

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,150
Look sharp! Take your batting stance!

62
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,140
With your four-ton bat!

63
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,950
Here goes! Molehill...

64
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,490
...Intersection #4!!

65
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,030
Usopp!

66
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,690
The weak are always weak,
no matter what they do! Take that!

67
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,150
You bastards!

68
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,490
Why, you...!

69
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,340
Oh, you want a go at it? That's perfect.

70
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
We'll send you into the next world,

71
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,930
just like we did that
cowardly punk with the nose!

72
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,950
Shut up! Usopp...

73
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,380
Usopp is no coward!

74
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,850
There are times... when a man...

75
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,370
...must not run from a fight...
no matter what...

76
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,580
You're still...?

77
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,980
Like when... like when his
friend's dream... is laughed at...

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,320
Impossible! Your head was
knocked in with a four-ton bat!

79
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,450
You can't still be alive!
You can't still be able to get up!

80
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,740
What trick did you use this time?!

81
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,540
Luffy... isn't dead...

82
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,800
He's gonna be...
king of the pirates someday...

83
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm sure he will...!

84
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,180
That's the one thing...

85
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,780
...that's the one thing
I won't let you laugh at!

86
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,860
Ha! Looks like you still
haven't learned your lesson yet.

87
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,490
One more time, Mr. 4!

88
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,260
You think I'm gonna let that happen?!

89
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,430
Let me show you a transformation
point that I've been saving!

90
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,010
Horn Point!

91
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,600
Usopp!

92
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,650
Your determination,
at least, is praiseworthy,

93
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,320
but no matter how resolute you might be,

94
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,830
you can't do anything in your shape!

95
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,750
C-Chopper...!

96
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,850
Get... b-behind... me...!

97
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,030
You got it!

98
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Get ready, Mr. 4!

99
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,570
Take this! Special Attack...

100
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,440
Here it comes! Molehill...

101
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,860
...Smoke Star!!

102
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,300
The rest... is up to you, Chopper!

103
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,890
All right!

104
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,780
That kid took off his boots and got away!

105
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,720
What the--?! Hey!

106
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,950
Molehill Intersection #4!!

107
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,540
Stop! Mr. 4! It's me!

108
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,430
Hey!

109
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,330
You guys look over here!

110
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,270
Special Attack: Uso-Cho Hammer Comet!!

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,920
We did it...!

112
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,140
Usopp!

113
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,860
Usopp! Hang in there!

114
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,320
Don't you die!

115
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,150
Someone get a doctor!

116
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,510
A doctor!

117
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,550
That's you!

118
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,390
"Alubarna - Southeast Gate Battle"

119
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,890
"Alubarna - Southeast Gate Battle"
"Winners: Team Usopp & Chopper"

120
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,970
Are you okay?

121
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,540
Y-Yeah.

122
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,370
Koza! Are you all right?!

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,720
Y-Yeah.

124
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,330
You've still got that
bullet from Nanohana...

125
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,580
This is a battlefield.
Something like that doesn't matter here.

126
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,230
Never mind me,

127
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,700
I'd like to get one
of their horses somehow.

128
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,030
If we get down this street,
and through the center of town,

129
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,670
we'll be at the north block,
where the palace is.

130
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,410
The palace? What are you planning to do?

131
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,140
Demand that King Cobra surrender.

132
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,050
Don't be ridiculous! North block
is where the royal army's

133
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,840
main force, including Chaka and Pell,
will be! It's too dangerous!

134
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,670
We haven't even mustered
all of us together yet!

135
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,320
We can wait until reinforcements get here

136
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,570
from the other areas of town, right?

137
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,810
It's already too late as it is.

138
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,830
Give me a hand!

139
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,570
Hey, Koza!

140
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,690
Halt! Are you with the rebel army?!

141
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,970
There's nothing ahead in
north block but the palace!

142
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,260
Understand me?!

143
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,700
If you're not here as part of the battle,
leave this area of town at once!

144
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,250
Hey, are you listening, woman?!
This is no playground!

145
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,670
I know!

146
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,810
Princess Vivi!

147
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,440
It couldn't be!

148
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,540
Is it really her?

149
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,610
Where is my father? Where is he now?

150
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,730
W-Well, the thing is...

151
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,090
In that case...

152
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,630
...take me to where Chaka is!
There's something I want him to do!

153
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,660
Deux!

154
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,050
Un... deux...! Un... deux...!

155
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,490
You bastard...!

156
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,870
What a kick...

157
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,900
Imagine, him being able to
compete with my Ballet Kenpo!

158
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,240
Out of my way!

159
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,530
I told you, if you want to get by,
you'll have to defeat me, first.

160
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Just keep pushing your luck like that.

161
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,670
Day in and day out, lesson, lesson!

162
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,490
The dancer's kenpo I've refined will
not be beaten by the likes of you!

163
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,720
It's no use trying to escape from my fists!

164
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,100
Ballet Kenpo!!

165
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,540
Degenerate Swan Dance Recital!!

166
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,710
I'm not getting anywhere like this.
I'm gonna settle it right here and now!

167
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,150
Collier Shoot!!

168
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,290
Un!

169
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,470
Épaule!!

170
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:40,970
Deux!

171
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,170
Côtelette!!

172
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,560
Ora!

173
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,350
Selle!!

174
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,540
Un!

175
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,890
Poitrine!!

176
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,690
Deux!

177
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,570
Gigot!!

178
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,120
Krah!

179
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,860
Ballet Kenpo!

180
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,400
Mouton Shot!!

181
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,660
Swan Arabesque!!

182
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,570
My Mouton Shot...
blocked by that bastard...?

183
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,370
My Swan Arabesque, stopped by
that insignificant cook...?

184
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,000
You've got to be kidding me!

185
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,400
Okay, fine! I mean business!
From now on, I mean business!

186
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,350
Try me.

187
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,340
You don't know what
my ability is yet, do you?

188
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,340
What's amazing is the capacity
of my memory. If I use it,

189
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,640
I could make, say, this sort of montage!

190
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,890
When you see this, you will
laugh until you collapse.

191
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,250
First...

192
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,750
the world's most unusual hair...

193
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,760
Then, the world's most unusual eyes...

194
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,670
The world's most unusual nose...

195
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,150
The world's most unusual mouth...

196
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,620
Now, take a good, long look!

197
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,640
Grand opening, today!

198
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,190
The Copy-Copy Montage!

199
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,450
90% of that was your own face, huh?

200
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,650
You've left yourself open!

201
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,890
Stop playing around, you dirty bastard!

202
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,940
Don't you have a heart?! You devil!

203
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,930
I don't have time to mess
around with your craft.

204
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,670
Craft? That's nothing!
Calling it a craft is nothing!

205
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,340
There was someone like this once.

206
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,910
A man who, through friendship,
made me powerless.

207
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:22,280
Love is everything. People have
to have love. Your love needs me.

208
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,840
So that's it. I more or less get now...

209
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,000
...what you're going to do.

210
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,760
Go on, try to lay a hand on--

211
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,630
H-How could you?!
That was the face of your friend!

212
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,850
What do you take your friends to be?!

213
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,640
What are you, stupid? No matter
who you change your form into,

214
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,730
you're still you.

215
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,930
I'm not the sort that's
caught up by such images.

216
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,910
A person is their soul!

217
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,860
A person is their soul...?

218
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,320
You're so...

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
...refined!

220
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,640
I'm embarrassed to have
been caught up by looks!

221
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,340
All right. Even if I were to,
say, set myself up as her,

222
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,700
or any of your other friends,

223
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,600
Mellorine! Mellorine!

224
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,650
it wouldn't mean anything.

225
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,650
Mellorine! Mellorine!

226
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,280
Mellorine! Mellorine!

227
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,900
He's easy to read...

228
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,650
Mellorine! Mello--

229
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,900
Really easy to read...

230
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,650
--rine! Mellorine! Mel--

231
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,620
Seriously easy to read...

232
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,920
You're a fool.

233
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,490
It's Vivi-sama!

234
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,450
It's true! The princess has come back!

235
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,930
Why, at a time such as this?

236
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,770
Are you insane, Vivi-sama?! If we did that...

237
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,670
If we did that, what?
This land would be finished?

238
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,110
It wouldn't, would it?
This place isn't Alabasta, after all.

239
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,540
The Kingdom of Alabasta...

240
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,190
...is the people who are
hurting each other now!

241
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,550
It's because of them that this
place first became a country!

242
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,530
If we can stop this war,
then that's good enough!

243
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,680
Please! If we can draw everyone's
eyes over here for a few seconds...

244
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,870
...then I will come up
with something from there.

245
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,000
I swear, I will!

246
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,580
Destroy... this palace!

247
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,330
W-What are you saying, Princess?!

248
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,000
This palace has a 4,000-year history!

249
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,340
Please don't go through with
this foolish idea, Vivi-sama!

250
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,060
Chaka-sama, don't let
your judgment go astray!

251
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,460
The king is not present!

252
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,080
We cannot allow you
to do this on your own!

253
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,020
But then, Your Majesty,
the way things are headed,

254
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
this country is in a mortal crisis!

255
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,030
So what if it is? Are you
saying we should wipe out

256
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,890
the people of this land,
without even knowing the cause?

257
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,810
That indeed would be the
destruction of this country.

258
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,370
We set out for Rainbase, where Crocodile is.

259
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,710
Forgive me for saying so,

260
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,660
but if we were to turn
against Crocodile now,

261
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,650
it would be like pouring fuel
on the flames of rebellion.

262
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,990
While we would be attacking Rainbase,

263
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,620
the rebel army would come
against Alubarna Palace!

264
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,060
And so what if a rebel army
were to take the castle?

265
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,600
Even if we, the royal army, were to fall,

266
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,900
if we cut out the root of this,
the country will surely rise again.

267
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,340
It is not this castle that
we should be protecting,

268
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,220
it is the people of this country!

269
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,390
Remember...

270
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,170
...the people are the country.

271
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,100
Vivi-sama...

272
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,660
I shall do as you say!

273
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,850
I always wanted to talk about it

274
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,790
I couldn't even say half of it

275
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm by your side, I glitter
every time we share a dream

276
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:55,650
The smile you gently gave me
was a very happy and kind one

277
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,020
Glory glory you're my shine

278
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,560
Because you're here, even
these tears turn to courage

279
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,100
I want to be strong,
I want to share with you

280
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,970
I'm sure I'll make it there

281
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,980
Yaah! Why are they coming after me?!

282
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,990
That dumb woman! Where did she go?!

283
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,620
This first-class cook of the sea
is nothing special, is he?!

284
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,330
Let me show you my dancer's kenpo,

285
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,330
developed during my daily lessons, lessons!

286
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,660
On the next episode of One Piece!

287
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,000
"Transformed into Nami!
Bon Clay's Rapid-Fire Ballet Kenpo"

288
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,380
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
