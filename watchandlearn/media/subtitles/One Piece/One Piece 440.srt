2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,020
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,670
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,690
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,570
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,600
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,340
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,650
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,530
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

51
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,090
Luffy has snuck into Impel Down
to rescue his brother, Ace,

52
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,770
who has been captured by the Navy.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,260
Bon Clay who was saved by
Ivankov of New Kama Land...

54
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,530
...has just learned that Luffy's
treatment has already begun!

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,870
Don't underestimate miracles!

56
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,920
"Believe in Miracles!
Bon Clay's Cries from the Heart!"

57
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,190
M-Miracles?

58
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,950
Yeah!

59
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,560
But it will take a tremendous miracle
for Straw boy to survive!

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,520
I believe in Straw-chan's spirit!

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,710
I believe that miracles can happen!

62
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,370
B-Because it's Straw-chan!

63
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,310
I believe that he can do it!

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,100
Then, stop panicking!

65
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,150
We have to trust him and wait!

66
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,710
So I ate the Horm-Horm Fruit

67
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,020
and now I can control people's hormones

68
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,460
and change their sex, body temperatures,

69
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,910
skin colors, growth and emotions!

70
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,640
I can remodel people from the inside,

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm like an engineer of the human body!

72
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,090
I can feel that you're
like the candies here...

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,190
...except they've all
transcended sex completely!

74
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,410
Some men you see could have been women...

75
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,830
...and some women could have been men!

76
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,390
That's some kind of miracle!

77
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,770
That's some kind of miracle-able!

78
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,430
That's right!

79
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,480
He changed that man to a
woman by injecting hormones!

80
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,500
Umm... But I still can't believe
there's a place like this in a prison!

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,990
I must be dreaming!

82
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,650
It's not a dream!

83
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,610
It's a dream land!

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,460
All of these candies were lost
prisoners who made it here by luck!

85
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,550
You see--there are entrances to
this New Kama Land on every floor!

86
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,400
There's one at the bloody mountain of needles,

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
and in the lair of wild beasts!

88
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,060
Or in the burning hellfire!

89
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,100
Even in the mortuary.

90
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,400
We use those passages to
get everything we need!

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,640
Jailers would never think that
there was a paradise like this in hell.

92
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,420
But we always know what's going on out there!

93
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,000
Because we've got a Transponder Snail

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,280
which is the same as the ones the jailers use.

95
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,690
So we can get all information
inside the prison!

96
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,120
And we steal newspapers from garbage cans

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,220
so we know what's going on outside, too!

98
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,730
We enjoyed watching the adventures
of the first invader--Straw boy...

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,030
...as well as you and the others!

100
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,230
We had so much fun!

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,630
Where are we in the prison?!
How did you find a space like this?!

102
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh, this place wasn't always here.

103
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,690
I heard that there was a prisoner
with a hole-digging ability

104
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,050
and with that candy in the lead,

105
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,630
they built this prisoners' paradise long ago!

106
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,360
This place is like an ant farm that's been
created by digging tunnels in the rock.

107
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,940
It's right in the middle of level 5 and level 6!

108
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,130
Wait a minute! Level 6?!
There is such a floor?!

109
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,720
Well, it's not widely known but...

110
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,270
...there is level 6 where true villains are kept!

111
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,010
Every one of them is condemned
to a lifetime without parole!

112
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,110
That's level 6--Eternal Hell!

113
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,070
Exceedingly cruel crimes are often
covered up by the government.

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,700
As are incidents that'd harm
the reputation of the government.

115
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,160
For example, you guys
rampaged all the way to level 4

116
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,630
but if you'd tried that a little while ago,
it wouldn't have been so easy.

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,760
Because there was another
threat in this prison!

118
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,310
He was the Jail Manager of Impel Down -

119
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,810
Shiryu of the Rain!

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,760
He's as strong as Warden Magellan.

121
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,560
If you think about how little
Magellan actually works,

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,310
Shiryu was twice as troublesome.

123
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,770
S-Strong as Warden Magellan?!

124
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,860
Impel Down was iron-tight with those two!

125
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,930
Jail Manager Shiryu of the Rain...

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,470
What do you think you're doing, Shiryu?!

127
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,060
What do you mean?

128
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,030
The prisoners are not here
for your amusement!

129
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,660
No one cares whether or not these vermin die!

130
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,180
I can't overlook your actions any longer!

131
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,500
If anyone finds out what you've done here,

132
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,090
it will disgrace Impel Down!

133
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,670
Now I must exercise my authority
and put you under arrest!

134
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,420
He put prisoners to the sword as he wanted

135
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,730
and was out of control

136
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,390
so they hold him in level 6
now as a security risk.

137
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,750
I've never heard of this!

138
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,610
Even though it happened before I got here...

139
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,160
There are also pirates like

140
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
the world's most dangerous woman--
Catalina Devon,

141
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,670
"Great Battleship" San Juan Wolf,

142
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,670
"Heavy Drinker" Vasco Shot!

143
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,550
These are names that'd make
anyone shiver with fright!

144
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,770
There are wretched criminals,
whose crimes were so cruel

145
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,360
even papers refused to mention them...

146
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,430
...all down there in level 6.

147
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,700
Your former boss is there, too!

148
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
He's just as crazy as the others!

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,740
What?! 0-chan?! Crocodile?!

150
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,660
You guys were enemies of
Straw boy at Alabasta, right?

151
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,440
It's interesting!

152
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,020
It goes to show that anyone
can become friends!

153
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,650
You're right!

154
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,980
There is also a Warlord of the Sea
- "First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

155
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,210
And the guy that Straw boy snuck in here for.

156
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,250
He's the second division commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates--

157
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,550
Portgaz D. Ace!

158
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,220
I heard it over the radio!
They are brothers, right?!

159
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,330
Yes, Straw-chan said that the only reason
he came here was to rescue him!

160
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,900
It's miraculous that he snuck in.

161
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,390
But he's going to have to give it up!

162
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,100
He has to save himself first!

163
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,220
Today's the day that Ace boy
will be executed--at 3pm!

164
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,120
I think that they're gonna take him
to Navy Headquarters in the morning.

165
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,980
That means Ace boy will be taken
out of Impel Down in 7 or 8 hours!

166
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,720
Straw boy's treatment will take 2 more days!

167
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,250
Even if he survives,

168
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,930
he'd need 3 days of sleep
to restore his strength!

169
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,610
So when he wakes up, everything will be over!

170
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,070
But can he even take 2 more days of that?!

171
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,820
I told you that the possibility is low
and that he needs a miracle to make it!

172
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,350
You need to rest, too!

173
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,440
Eat something nutritious and go back to bed!

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,180
I'll offer you a quiet room to sleep in.

175
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,430
I'll stay with Straw-chan!

176
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, don't bother! He's...

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,850
There's little hope!

178
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,020
What are you gonna do?!

179
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,540
S-Straw-chan!

180
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,180
Hang in there!

181
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,550
Hang in there!

182
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,510
Hang in there!

183
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,220
Straw-chan!

184
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,040
I wonder how he's doing.

185
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,850
All he can do is wait.

186
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,990
Hang in there!

187
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,070
Hang in there! Straw-chan!

188
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,080
Hang in there! Hang...

189
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,460
Hang in there! Hang in there!

190
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,620
He's been doing it all this time?!

191
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,300
That's so stupid! That won't do anything!

192
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,960
You're right! Let's go!

193
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,930
Hang... Hang in...

194
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,020
Hang... Hang in there!

195
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,280
Can't you find...

196
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,650
...even one queer?!

197
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,090
Look for him again!

198
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,160
He's not back yet.

199
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,660
Is he still doing it?

200
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,870
He must have given up already
and probably went to sleep!

201
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,790
I'll go check!

202
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,020
I'll go!

203
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,070
Me, too!

204
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,170
I can't hear it anymore.

205
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,890
See, I told you!

206
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,310
He gave up and...

207
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,730
Hang... Hang in there!

208
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,790
Hang in there!

209
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,520
Hang... in... there!

210
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,660
Hang in there!

211
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,080
How long will he keep wasting time like that?!

212
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,760
Hang... Hang in...

213
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,930
S-Straw-chan...

214
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,690
S-Straw-chan...

215
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,120
That fool!

216
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,390
Hey, you alright?!

217
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,170
Take care of yourself first!

218
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,200
We gotta treat him!

219
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,360
Keep your hands to yourselves!

220
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,340
Let him do what he wants!

221
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,540
But...

222
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,660
Bon boy wants to struggle
and fight alongside Straw boy!

223
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,730
Even if there's only a ghost of a chance,
he believes in Straw boy

224
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,220
and puts his life on the line
and shouts himself hoarse!

225
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,680
S-Straw-chan!

226
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,200
They're both beyond their
capacities already but...

227
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,610
...they're trying to create a miracle!

228
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,800
For more than 10 hours,

229
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,300
S-Straw-chan has been fighting against
his own destiny for his life in this way!

230
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,810
Then I... I...

231
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,870
I shouldn't give in, either!

232
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,720
Hang... Hang in there!

233
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,710
Hang in there!

234
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,420
Hang in there, Straw-chan!

235
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,640
Straw-chan!

236
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,550
You have to live!

237
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Hang in there!

238
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,060
Hang in there!

239
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,300
Hang in there!

240
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,680
--Straw-chan!
--Hang in there!

241
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,690
Hang in there!

242
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,520
Hang in there!

243
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,060
Hang in there-able!

244
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,530
Straw-chan!

245
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,630
Hang in there!

246
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,650
Hang in there!

247
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,050
Straw-chan!

248
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,630
Hang in there!

249
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,030
Straw-chan!

250
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,380
WARDEN'S OFFICE

251
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,210
Warden!

252
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,180
I just heard from the canteen staff on level 5

253
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,980
and they said that Straw Hat Luffy has...

254
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,450
...disappeared!

255
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,260
What?!

256
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,880
V-Vice Warden Hannyabal!
What are you doing here?!

257
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,350
Hang in there!

258
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,580
Hang in there! Straw-chan!

259
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,060
Hang in there! Straw-chan!

260
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,240
Ace-san, I don't know anything
about that woman but...

261
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,050
...I think that you better
assume she's lying.

262
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,360
So you're saying that she came
all the way to here just to lie to me?!

263
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,750
Well, I'm sorry.

264
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,760
But, to tell you the truth, Jimbei.

265
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
My brother would do something like that!

266
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,520
He does stupid things!

267
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,610
Since we were kids,
he always made me worry, that fool!

268
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,930
Finally, the day has come!

269
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,740
I hope that we can get
rid of him successfully!

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,390
I don't want any wars in Impel Down!

271
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,320
Warden Magellan will be here any minute.

272
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,630
I-It's blood!

273
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,430
No more screams...

274
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,450
But the treatment is excruciating!

275
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,520
So the fact that we can't
hear him anymore means...

276
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,790
It's too bad!

277
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,650
But he did his best for 20 hours!

278
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,790
Straw-chan...

279
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,980
What... What?!

280
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,410
Food!

281
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,670
S... Straw-chan!

282
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,080
Yeah!

283
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,290
Straw boy! I...

284
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,880
I can't believe this!

285
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,190
How can this be true?!

286
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,090
It didn't even take a day!

287
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,770
Warden! Warden Magellan!

288
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,410
Good morning!

289
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,040
I've got very bad diarrhea...

290
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,230
Please hurry.

291
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,040
It's time to move the
condemned prisoner - Portgaz D. Ace

292
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,960
Bring more food here!

293
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,120
Keep it coming! Cooked or not!
The amount is what matters!

294
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,380
Hurry up! Just leave it close to him!

295
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,840
Wow! He's taking in food like a sand pit trap!

296
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,580
How long will he keep eating?!

297
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,940
He's been eating for
30 minutes at a steady pace!

298
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,390
He ate several days worth of
the food supply for Kama Land!

299
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,810
What an amazing vital force!

300
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,900
He's coming out!

301
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,490
What kind of creature is that?!

302
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,590
That's not the form of human being!

303
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm...

304
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,740
...recovered!

305
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,800
Thanks to Ivankov's treatment, Luffy has miraculously recovered

306
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,670
and intends to save Ace by himself.

307
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,470
Once Ivan-san learns that Luffy is the son of the revolutionary--Dragon,

308
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,060
he decides to lend Luffy his strength.

309
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,810
On the next episode of One Piece!

310
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,140
"Luffy's Back!
Ivan-san Begins the Breakout Plan!!"

311
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,290
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
