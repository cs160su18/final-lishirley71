2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,250
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,330
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,030
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,790
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,590
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,760
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,020
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,580
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,490
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,900
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,010
Make some waves...

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,830
Impel Down - the great prison that holds

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,750
villainous prisoners from all over the world.

40
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,960
The world's greatest prison - so heavily
guarded - has just been breached!

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,720
He has come to rescue his brother "Fire
Fist" Ace who will soon be executed.

42
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,010
He is Straw Hat Luffy.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,680
However...

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,520
twenty years ago...

45
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,260
there was a man who had broken
out of the iron-tight Impel Down!

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,660
This can't be real! He cut off his own legs!

47
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,920
This legendary person is...

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,930
"Golden Lion"

49
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,680
...the captain of the Flying Pirates,

50
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,990
Shiki the Golden Lion!

51
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,250
This is a story of what
happened several days ago...

52
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,240
...before Shiki the Golden Lion
faced Luffy and his friends!

53
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,220
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
A Gold Lion's Ambition on the Move!"

54
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
Captain! Colt-san!

55
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Ah? What?

56
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,740
We have word from Big Boss Shiki!

57
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,750
Well, finally! We've waited so long!

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,530
Bring a Transponder Snail here!

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,780
Yes! Right away!

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,790
Big Bro, we did it! If we
can join Shiki's party,

61
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,600
it's gonna be our chance
to become successful!

62
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,560
B-Big Bro? Why are you crying?

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,350
Amore! My beloved brother Colt!

64
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,530
I am very sad!

65
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,740
If the plan of senor
Shiki is put into action,

66
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,560
the world will be filled with sorrow.

67
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,500
When I think about hearing
thousands of despairing voices,

68
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,910
it makes me very very sad...

69
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,200
Here is a Transponder Snail!

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,580
Good! Put him through!

71
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,290
Are you the captain of
Amigo Pirates - Mr. Largo?

72
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,310
No, I'm a vice captain Colt.
Tell me what you want.

73
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,610
All right.

74
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,300
I called to let you know that we have decided

75
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,840
to welcome Mr. Largo to Big
Boss Shiki's assembly...

76
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,770
...as our 51st pirate captain.

77
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,690
--No surprise there!
--However...

78
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,020
...there is a condition to
your attending the assembly

79
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,860
and we need to ask you to fulfill that first.

80
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,060
Conditions?

81
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,500
Nothing so far...

82
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,590
No good at all...

83
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,610
I'm hungry...

84
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,380
You look pretty full to me.

85
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,500
We've been having banquets
every night these days.

86
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,230
So our stomachs have expanded and
we have to eat more to be satisfied.

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,590
You're right! It feels like my
bones are bigger these days...

88
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,150
Yeah, in your dreams.

89
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,920
How's it going? Catch something?

90
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,550
Not good! Not even a nibble!

91
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,480
We're totally out of food!

92
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,620
If you can't catch anything,
it'll be no food for you guys!

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,000
What?!

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,860
Don't "what?!" me!

95
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,440
I told you it was a bad idea

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,740
to have a banquet before
we got to the next island!

97
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,300
But you guys were...

98
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,710
Banquet! Banquet!

99
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,890
Is that how we were?

100
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,590
Don't even remember?!

101
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,600
A bite! I've got something!

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,810
Here it comes!

103
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,190
Way to go, Brook!

104
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a big one!

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,610
Great! We're gonna have
another banquet tonight!

106
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,960
Catch that fish even if it kills you!

107
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,450
--Banquet!
--Hang on! It's coming!

108
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,790
Looks like they're having fun.

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,190
It's coming! It's coming!

110
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,490
You gotta be kidding me!

111
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,580
What the hell is that?!

112
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,850
I-It's a...

113
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,560
...Beetle!

114
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,600
Our fish...

115
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,730
...He ate it!

116
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,770
Awesome!

117
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,610
It's...

118
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,350
...a pirate ship!

119
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,650
What shameless bastards!

120
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,580
Boss! Get them!

121
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,100
I-It's coming back!

122
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,100
That's a big beetle!

123
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,330
I wanna ride on it!

124
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,070
What?! Are you nuts, Luffy?!

125
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,180
Hey, Usopp! Let's catch it!

126
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,450
Alright!

127
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,160
Where the hell did you get that net?!

128
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm not gonna let it destroy our ship!

129
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,830
Coup de Vent!

130
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,540
Franky's attack didn't work?!

131
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,070
Can't be true!

132
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,640
Leave it to me!

133
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,190
Alright, come on, you giant beetle!

134
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,400
Gum-Gum...

135
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,000
...Bazooka!

136
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,550
They blew Boss away!

137
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,970
That beetle breathes fire!

138
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,420
He's gonna roast our ship!

139
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,650
Luffy! You alright?!

140
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,580
That beetle isn't just
huge - he breathes fire...

141
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,160
How cool is that?

142
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,030
Huh?

143
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,420
He looks just fine.

144
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,100
Okay! I'm gonna make him one of us!

145
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,830
What?! No! Wait a minute, Luffy!

146
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,090
Alright, you giant beetle! Join my...

147
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,810
I got you!

148
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,020
This can't be true!

149
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,390
What is he doing there?

150
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,080
They're coming this way...

151
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Yeah, they seem to be getting bigger...

152
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,700
He's aiming at us!

153
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,330
Help... Help...

154
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,040
Help me!

155
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,030
--Oh no, Usopp!
--Damn it! You idiot!

156
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,510
He's flying away!

157
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,100
What were they thinking?!

158
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,580
Hey, look! An island!

159
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,610
Is that where the beetle came from?

160
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,990
Boss!

161
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,910
Watch out, Boss!

162
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,790
H-Hey! We're gonna hit the wall!

163
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,690
You can't get away now, you giant beetle!

164
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,650
Just give up and become one of my crew!

165
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,100
I don't take "no" for an answer!

166
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,580
My boss...

167
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,750
...will never become...

168
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,870
...a pirate!

169
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,120
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

170
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,480
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

171
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,260
Ow, ow, ow! What is this place?

172
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,470
I didn't know there was an island like this.

173
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,230
And for that matter...

174
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,810
...What the hell is going on?

175
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,650
Yoko! What happened?!

176
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,990
Be careful! He's a pirate!

177
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,780
A pirate?! No!

178
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,990
Show us mercy!

179
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,460
Stop doing that!

180
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,280
You people are Straw Hats, aren't you?

181
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,420
Yes, we are.

182
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,140
Oh yeah! He's a Straw Hat!

183
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,600
Ah! He's "Pirate Hunter" Zoro!

184
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,020
And he's "Black Foot" Sanji!

185
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,980
And then he's...

186
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,560
Who are you?

187
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,650
Let me go! He tried to steal Boss from me!

188
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,570
I'm gonna bite you to death!

189
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,590
Yoko! Stop!

190
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,950
Shut up and just let me go!

191
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,400
Who are these people?

192
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,210
Ouch! You are the owner of this beetle?

193
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,670
The owner?! No way! Boss is my friend!

194
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,400
Friend?

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,050
Oh, you're already on someone else's team?

196
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,300
Is there any way that you'd let me have him?

197
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,430
Of course not! Over my dead body!

198
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,980
Alright! I give him up!

199
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,900
Huh?!

200
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,360
Here we go!

201
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,070
Hey! What're you doing?!

202
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,210
Boss!

203
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,630
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

204
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,840
You think that you defeated him?!

205
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,190
No, I didn't mean it like that.

206
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,930
Boss!

207
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,560
--Hey!
--Stay away!

208
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,840
These wounds mean nothing to him!

209
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,320
They'll heal up overnight while
he's sleeping underground.

210
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,240
Wow! That's amazing!

211
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,110
Not only that! Tomorrow he will molt!

212
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,950
He'll become bigger and stronger!

213
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,990
Huh? Do they continue doing that
even as full grown beetles?

214
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,010
Boss is different. He sheds
his skin once a month.

215
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,090
That's why he's so big.

216
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,800
You're gonna be stronger than you are now?

217
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,430
Yes, he is! What do you say to that?!

218
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,400
That's cool!

219
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,770
Alright! Then, let's have
this fight again tomorrow!

220
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,860
Let's make it clear which
one of us is stronger!

221
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,710
That's so silly... Oh?

222
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,700
Alright! So I have your word, then!

223
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,500
He is an interesting young man as they say!

224
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,830
Boss?

225
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,530
This way!

226
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,200
What a big cave! What is it for?!

227
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,640
This is an escape route.

228
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,260
Escape route?

229
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,260
This cave is like a maze.

230
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,290
We can escape through this
cave when pirates come.

231
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,040
We are world champions at
running away and groveling!

232
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,970
Y-You're proud of it?

233
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,490
That's how we survive in the Grand Line.

234
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,480
We don't have a military
and it's a remote island

235
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,460
so the Navy always leaves
us on a back burner.

236
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,950
Speaking about the Navy, that
girl was wearing a Navy coat.

237
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,800
Is there any reason for that?

238
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,510
She wears it in memory of her father.

239
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,280
He was a good man.

240
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,410
He couldn't stand by and see us
repeatedly attacked by pirates

241
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,060
so he stayed on this island separated from

242
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,190
other marines in order to protect us.

243
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
You said "in memory of" so I assume...

244
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,660
It was exactly five years ago...

245
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,740
he was fighting against some
pirates alone and died.

246
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,200
Three years later,

247
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,980
Boss came to us out of nowhere.

248
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,860
He bonded with Yoko right away and became

249
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,100
the guardian angel of this island.

250
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:27,150
Maybe, Boss reminds her of her
late father who was strong.

251
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,140
Is it okay for us to be here?

252
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,360
We're pirates.

253
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,440
You people are different! Now, we are here!

254
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,530
Wow! A windmill! It's gigantic!

255
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,530
It's so high!

256
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,600
Oh! I thought that it was just a
crag but it's beautiful in the back!

257
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,960
But then...

258
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,390
How can I say this? The buildings
here are all different in style...

259
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,770
It's a strange town!

260
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,270
Can't you see?

261
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,730
It was a deserted island when we first

262
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,740
got here and that was just the beginning.

263
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,910
Since then, for some reason, people
are coming here from the same ocean.

264
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,000
That's what made this town.

265
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,870
Welcome, Straw Hats!

266
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,670
This is Kansorn Island where people
from the East Blue live together!

267
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,950
It also known as Little East Blue!

268
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,720
Yeah! I didn't expect to see the rookie
of great promise in the East Blue!

269
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,110
Zoro-san! You're from
Frost Moon Village, right?

270
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,110
We have a training hall for
people who came from there!

271
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,200
Come and see it!

272
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,850
A training hall?!

273
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,330
Sanji-san, you grew up on The Baratie, right?

274
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,290
Try the food at the local Baratie!

275
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,590
It's pretty good!

276
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,070
You have The Baratie here?!

277
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,850
Anyone from Syrup Village?!

278
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,450
I think Luigia is from there.

279
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,780
Luigia?!

280
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah. She's living in the most
luxurious mansion in this town!

281
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,880
Mansion? The only mansion in
Syrup Village is Kaya's mansion.

282
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,420
Humph! Everybody's so caught up in them!

283
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,770
Pirates are all the same!

284
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,310
I wonder how they're doing...

285
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,750
Don't worry, Chopper! They'll call us soon!

286
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,060
You think?

287
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,070
We better get an insect cage fixed for them.

288
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,200
You're right. If the beetle
joins us, we will need it.

289
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,890
See? It's them!

290
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,830
Hey, it's me! Is Nami there?

291
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,120
Usopp? It's me! What's
wrong? Did you catch it?

292
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,810
No no no, it's...

293
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,170
Shut up! Calm down!

294
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,520
I got it!

295
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,340
Um... I'm wondering - can you come over here?

296
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,720
Huh?

297
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,250
There's a town on the
other side of the island!

298
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,240
They say that they really wanna see you!

299
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,350
Call her "Nami-sama"!

300
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,100
What's going on?

301
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,230
Anyway, just come over here! I beg you!

302
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,100
Huh? Wait, Usopp!

303
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,440
He hung up!

304
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,470
Why do they want just Nami?

305
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,610
I don't know.

306
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,120
Okay! Let's just go!

307
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,110
I'll leave the ship to you!

308
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,790
Yeah! Count on us!

309
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
There she goes...

310
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,590
Is this it?!

311
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,400
It's a rockbound and there
are reefs all around it

312
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,390
so regular ships can't approach the island.

313
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,310
Well, reefs are no problem with this ship.

314
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,980
Alright! Let's go hunting!

315
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,490
We're gonna get the big beetle that
took off from Shiki's hide-out!

316
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,950
Let's go, guys!

317
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,010
Yeah!

318
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,400
The Straw Hats arrive at the island

319
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,130
where immigrants from East Blue live.

320
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,670
The scenery looks so much like

321
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,120
their homeland that they
can't help but reminisce.

322
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,760
But the Amigo Pirates are also heading
toward the island in pursuit

323
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,010
of the giant beetle!

324
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

325
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,180
"A Special Presentation Related to the Movie!
Little East Blue in Danger!"

326
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
