2
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,350
A world... Yes!

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
A world for you who seek freedom

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
stretches out right before your eyes.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,380
If your endless dreams are your guide,

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,640
surpass them, under the flag of your beliefs!

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,340
Heading towards a world without end

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,620
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,630
In search of light yet unseen

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,300
When the summer sun
sways the sails of my heart

12
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,810
It's the cue to open the door to a new world

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Sailing through the rocky waves of despair

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,990
We head beyond the horizon

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,670
Making a splash,
I've just started on my search

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,300
Heading towards a world without end

17
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,420
My heart bursting with enthusiasm,
I'll go to the ends of the earth

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,510
In search of light yet unseen

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,900
"Upper Yard" "Angel Island"

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,990
After the campfire ended...

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,290
Usopp had a mysterious experience late at night.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:37,240
Meanwhile, Ohm, Gedatsu, and Shura
were called to God's shrine...

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,020
...where God Eneru made an appearance.

24
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,510
Tomorrow, I will let you enter
all areas of Upper Yard.

25
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,000
You can set up your ordeals wherever you like.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,660
You can also ignore the rules
and go as wild as you want.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,180
Tell me, Merry. Who was that?

28
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,140
--Let's get going!
--Yeah!

29
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,140
"A Giant Snake Bares Its Fangs!
The Survival Game Begins"

30
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,620
Hey! Where are you going, Zoro?!

31
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,090
That's the wrong way! West is this way!

32
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,610
Geez! Your horrible sense
of direction is such a pain!

33
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,580
West? That's east!

34
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,080
C'mon, Luffy! Why don't you
ever listen to anyone?!

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,470
It's the "skull's right eye," so we
gotta go right! Are you stupid?!

36
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,310
I think they both are...

37
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,790
We're heading south, so could
you tell them it's this way?

38
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,060
You got it!

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
Luffy! Zoro!

40
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,450
South, huh? Why didn't you say so sooner?!

41
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,490
Luffy! That's a nice stick!

42
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,780
Isn't it? You can't have it! Go find your own!

43
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,600
You're so lucky! Stick...! Stick...!

44
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,430
What about sticks?

45
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:59,510
I thought this forest would be a
scarier place, but it's not so bad!

46
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,780
Chopper! You're strong today?

47
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,150
That's right!

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,740
I feel so reassured when I'm with these three!

49
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,060
But it really is a let-down, to be honest.

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,040
There was nothing in the
forest yesterday, either.

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,970
We didn't run across a single priest.
I know how you feel, Chopper.

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,050
Right?!

53
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,890
What odd people. Do you want
an accident to happen that badly?

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,280
Huh? Those big roots have a weird pattern...

55
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,570
It's moving!

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,660
What's moving, Chopper?

57
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,540
O-Oh, nothing! It's nothing at all!

58
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,250
If I said I saw roots moving,
they'd all laugh at me for being afraid.

59
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,500
I'm supposed to be strong today!
I bet it was my imagination!

60
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,030
I sense something strange...

61
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,970
Chopper. Why do you keep
looking behind you?

62
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,750
N-No reason at all!

63
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,060
What are those big roots with a weird pattern?

64
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,530
You see it, too?! I knew it was strange!

65
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,920
Why are the roots moving?

66
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,200
You see it too?! Actually,
I noticed earlier, and...!

67
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,580
--W-What the...?!
--What the...?!

68
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,430
The wind's good! The helm's good!

69
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,890
Truly comfortable! What a perfect cruise!

70
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,620
But this thing sure is slow!
Hey, navigator! Do something!

71
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,990
I'm afraid I can't, Captain Usopp!

72
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,040
Say that again...

73
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
--I'm afraid I can't!
--No, not that part!

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,200
The Milky Road has intense ups and downs,

75
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
so our only choice is to rely
on the dial ship's power!

76
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,910
You can do it, Crow!

77
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,200
Oh, and Sanji. Be at my guard at all times!

78
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,880
The captain is afraid of this forest...

79
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,510
Shut up! Then quit acting
like a big-shot captain!

80
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,390
And just so you know, I'm only
going to protect Nami-san!

81
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,800
Oh, yeah! It's time for the
Weird Knight's medicine!

82
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,850
Where did Chopper say he put it again?

83
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,040
My name is Gan Fall. Gan Fall.

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,760
Oh, the medicine's on a
barrel next to the fridge.

85
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Thanks, Nami-san!

86
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,570
Okay!

87
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,440
Looks like you've gotten a lot better, old man!

88
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,800
Yes. I thank you all.

89
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,270
If you're gonna thank anyone,
thank our ship's doctor!

90
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,350
Chopper's medicine works real wonders!

91
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,400
Oh, but you tried to save Chopper, right?

92
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,230
Then you're both even!

93
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,760
Old man?

94
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,400
Shall I talk a little about this land's history?

95
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,050
Until six years ago, I was God...

96
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,100
Did you hit your head, old man?

97
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:37,720
As you know, it is said that
Upper Yard appeared in Skypiea

98
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,670
some 400 years ago.

99
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,000
Until then, Skypiea had
been a peaceful sky island...

100
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,690
Items from the Blue Sea that
sporadically rode up the Knock-Up Stream

101
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,930
were rare and valuable to the sky people.

102
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,200
All the Vearth on the sky islands
came into the sky in this way.

103
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:10,140
But Vearth the size of Upper Yard
was an unimaginable miracle.

104
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,610
Naturally, the sky people were
overjoyed and worshipped it

105
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,740
as holy ground bestowed by Heaven.

106
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,830
However, indigenous people
lived on this Vearth,

107
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,210
and a battle over its ownership began.

108
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,270
Those people are the Shandians...

109
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,640
--You mean the guerrillas?!
--Yes.

110
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,970
So they originally lived on
Jaya in the world below?

111
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,980
Yes. They were sent into the sky
with the island, against their will.

112
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,840
Yet, you guys kicked them off the island?

113
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,280
Yes. The sky people stole their
homeland, due to their own greed...

114
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,210
Even after 400 years,

115
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,910
the war between the Shandians
and the sky people has not ended.

116
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,050
The Shandians are simply trying
to take back their homeland.

117
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,920
That's... kind of heartbreaking.

118
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,970
Then doesn't that make you the bad guys?!

119
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,090
Yes... You're right.

120
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,720
Oh, my medicine. Thank you.

121
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,730
What about Eneru?

122
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,890
Who is this "God Eneru"?

123
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,300
When I was God,

124
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,140
he suddenly appeared from
some sky island, leading soldiers.

125
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,220
He made a heavy blow to my
"Divine Squad" and to the Shandians,

126
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,520
then took control of Upper Yard.

127
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,700
This was six years ago.

128
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,440
Most of the Divine Squad is now
being forced to work hard by Eneru.

129
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,020
I do not know the details.

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,800
But to the Shandians, who God
is doesn't change the situation.

131
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,400
They simply want their homeland back.

132
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,400
If these Shandians just
want their homeland back,

133
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,990
why'd they attack us the
instant we came to the sky?

134
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:51,640
Members of the Divine Squad
sometimes escape via ship.

135
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,400
Naturally, the Shandians see them
as enemies and try to eliminate them.

136
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,970
Perhaps they mistook you for them.

137
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,900
We were almost killed because
of a mistake? That's too much!

138
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,930
One reason I became the Sky Knight

139
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,870
was so that I could help those
escapees flee to other islands safely.

140
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,880
As criminals, they can't stay here,
where Eneru can observe them.

141
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,670
From the sound of it, "God Eneru"
is almost like a king of terror...

142
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,310
Hey, now! Watch what you say!
The almighty God sees all!

143
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,850
Since when did you become
a native Skypiean?!

144
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,770
D-Didn't you hear what he just said?!

145
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,060
Terror, huh? No, it is worse than that.

146
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,080
Eneru establishes outsiders
like yourselves as criminals,

147
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,830
then has the denizens of Skypiea
lead them to their "judgment."

148
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,600
What this brings about is the
citizens' "awareness of sin."

149
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,480
A person becomes his weakest when
he senses sin in his own actions.

150
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
Eneru knows this.

151
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,880
He creates his own "lost sheep"
and controls them.

152
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,650
He is truly playing God. He's a powerful man...

153
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,400
We thought we found a paradise
when we arrived at Angel Beach...

154
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,820
Boy, were we wrong...

155
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,540
This is one hell of a place the
old city of gold flew up to...

156
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,150
Oh, that reminds me.

157
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,320
This "gold" you've been
fussing about since last night...

158
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,880
What exactly is it?

159
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,300
Eh?!

160
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,490
So you've appeared again...

161
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,910
Leave, old man!

162
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,070
Stop it, Wyper! Gan Fall is here to negotiate!

163
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,250
Negotiate, my ass!

164
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,560
Move aside, Chief!

165
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,550
Do you expect us to agree to a
compromise between two old men?!

166
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,220
Listen, Gan Fall!
We're not budging a single inch!

167
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,310
If you insist that fighting is
pointless, then give it all back!

168
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,260
Do you know what you've done
to us Shandians for generations?!

169
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,440
So why do you want "coexistence" now?!

170
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,680
I cannot return everything.

171
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,420
The power of Upper Yard's Vearth
is essential to Skypiea now.

172
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,950
They are all grateful for its blessings.

173
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,340
I cannot possibly take that
away from innocent people!

174
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,790
You're saying the sky people are innocent?!

175
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,500
Maybe so, if you live in peace and never fight!

176
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,310
Should we get people outside your
"Divine Squad" involved, too?!

177
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,960
Don't be foolish!

178
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,640
If you wanna undo your sins, take a risk!

179
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,980
Sacrifice 100 people who don't
wanna die, and bring their heads here!

180
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,770
I cannot do that!

181
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,420
Then our negotiations
have broken down! Leave!

182
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,900
Unless you want your head
removed where you stand!

183
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Wait, Wyper!

184
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,380
Don't be saying my name so freely...

185
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,990
I...

186
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,800
...love pumpkin juice.

187
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,060
I'll kill you!

188
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,270
Wait, Wyper!

189
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,770
Men! Stop Wyper!

190
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,230
What are you doing?!
Kamakiri! Braham! Not you, too?!

191
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,460
Aisa certainly cries a lot, doesn't she?

192
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,540
Yes. She always cries when something
scary happens in the village.

193
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,130
Is it because of Wyper...?

194
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,630
It's okay, it's okay.

195
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm not sure. Though he always is
in the center of any trouble there is.

196
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,650
Why do you think it's him?

197
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm afraid of him, too...

198
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,870
After all, he's almost like a demon...

199
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,250
The Vearth!

200
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Wyper!

201
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,760
I told you, that's Aisa's treasure!

202
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,450
Stop.

203
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,180
Braham!

204
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,780
Don't assume we'll get another chance!

205
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,340
I won't let this opportunity go!

206
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,950
Those who aren't prepared,
stay here. I won't blame you.

207
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,700
C'mon, Wyper! We're always prepared!

208
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,950
Are you prepared to abandon
anyone who falls during the fight?

209
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,900
Those who can step over comrades
and keep moving, come with me!

210
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,470
Today... Eneru's head will be mine!

211
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,980
Run! It's a giant snake!

212
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,700
What size! Is this also a result of
the sky island's environment?

213
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,760
You're like a catfish! I'll chop you into chunks!

214
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,980
How the hell can something
so big move so fast?!

215
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,210
Poison!

216
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,040
I think we should run away...

217
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,540
Definitely.

218
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,040
Yikes!

219
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,760
Don't touch the poison! You'll die instantly!

220
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,610
Hey! Poisonous snake! Over here! Follow me!

221
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,990
Your food's running away!

222
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,700
Robin! Look out!

223
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,510
Cinco Fleurs!

224
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,870
Too bad!

225
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,930
Robin! You're incredible...!

226
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,460
Alright! I should be behind its tail now...

227
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,140
Crap!

228
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,310
This way! Over here!

229
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,390
This isn't good...

230
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,830
I returned to our course,
but no one is coming...

231
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,790
Did I get separated? Should I
go ahead and wait for them?

232
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,580
Oh, no! I got separated! Huh?! Huh?!

233
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,760
H-Help! Where is everyone?!

234
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,950
Where are they? I look away for
a second and this happens...

235
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,480
Oh, well. I'm sure they'll manage somehow.

236
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,180
I got most of the map memorized,
anyway. It's to the right.

237
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,110
Yeesh...

238
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,510
Where'd they all go? Am I lost now?

239
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,170
Oh, well. Guess I'll go ahead
and wait at the ruins.

240
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,200
She said "straight south,"
and south is in a warm-ish direction!

241
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,950
This way!

242
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,960
It seems the Shandians have started to move...

243
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,120
And the Blue Sea people
have split into two groups...

244
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,550
And then split up even more... Solo, huh?

245
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,680
Today is going to be a lively day.
Just how many people will survive?

246
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,430
Well then, let the survival game begin!

247
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,710
We're now heading for God's shrine!

248
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,740
Don't stop, no matter what happens!

249
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,080
We're after only one thing... Eneru's head!

250
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,840
Yeah!

251
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,270
Even if we're far apart

252
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:28,740
I don't want you to forget

253
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:38,170
That on those days when
you're brought to tears

254
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,630
You have a friend here to share the pain

255
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,110
That far-off feeling we refuse to concede

256
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,760
I won't let it just be a dream

257
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,780
The eternal brilliance that
everyone is searching for

258
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:13,360
We will surely embrace it with our own hands

259
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,530
How many will survive?

260
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,600
Where is everyone?! Help me!

261
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,660
If you want a shoulder, you can have it!

262
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,060
They get lost so easily when I'm gone!

263
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,890
Eneru's head will be ours today!

264
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,200
Only five will be standing in three hours' time.

265
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
On the next episode of One Piece!

266
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,960
"The Deadly Reject!
War Demon Wyper's Resolve"

267
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,310
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
