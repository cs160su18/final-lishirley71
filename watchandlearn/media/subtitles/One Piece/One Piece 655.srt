67
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,500
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,770
We are the one! Go ahead!

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

71
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

72
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,330
However, no one has ever fully explored it

73
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,430
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,290
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,690
a boy whose body turned to rubber
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

77
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,750
and his friends venture into that sea.

78
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

79
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,910
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

80
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,050
Luffy and the others formed a
pirate alliance with Trafalgar Law

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,730
and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.

82
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,010
When Luffy found out that the
prize for a fighting event

83
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,900
was the Flare-Flare Fruit,

84
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,430
he decided to enter and fight fierce
battles against other tough

85
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,200
contenders from the New World.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,050
Come after me, Doflamingo!

87
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,950
What? Is he gonna go across the bridge?

88
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,550
No! Idiots!

89
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,640
I get it.

90
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,810
Wait, Doflamingo!
They have nothing to do with this!

91
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,850
It's over, Law!

92
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,780
--Doflamingo is flying towards us!
--What?!

93
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,950
Young Master-sama!

94
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,690
What is this?! A nightmare?!
Are we gonna get killed?!

95
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,760
No!

96
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,750
Watch this, Law!

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll viciously slay your allies
right before your eyes!

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,730
Don't!

99
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,440
Tra-guy, help...

100
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,310
Hey!

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,970
My friends are crying in fear!

102
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,770
Leave them alone!

103
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,450
Sanji!

104
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,860
Here comes quite a tough one.

105
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,290
"A Big Clash!
Sanji vs. Doflamingo!"

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,310
You're the "Black Foot" of
the Straw Hats, aren't you?

107
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,380
Diable Jambe...

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,000
...Premiere Hachis Hash!

109
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,100
Pentachromatic Strings!

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,530
--Sanji-san!
--What did Doflamingo do?!

111
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,610
Save your friends if you can.

112
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,420
--Doflamingo is coming this way!
--You've got to be kidding!

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,750
Young Master-sama!

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,060
--Stay away from us!
--Go away!

115
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,840
No!

116
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,690
Diable Jambe...

117
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,050
...Poele a Frire...

118
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,110
...Spectre!

119
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,180
It's powerful! He's quite strong!

120
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,100
All right, Sanji!

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,390
Go!

122
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,680
Wh-What happened? I can't move!

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,970
Oh? Sanji-san got frozen in mid air!

124
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,010
He's been grappled
by the Young Master's power!

125
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,890
Doflamingo's power?!

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Black Foot is like a bug caught
in a spider's web now!

127
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,270
All he can do is wait for death!

128
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,300
What?!

129
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,700
Look!

130
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,880
--What is it?!
--A whip?!

131
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,050
Don't do anything! Just run!
Use Coup de Burst to get out of here!

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,180
We can't do that!

133
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,450
Overheat!

134
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,720
Sanji!

135
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,290
Get away, Sanji-kun!

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,690
Shambles!

137
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,130
Room!

138
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,860
Law, eh?

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,440
DRESSROSA

140
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,380
Run!

141
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,920
It's Tra-guy! He saved Sanji!

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,090
Sorry. I made a mistake!
Let's get on the ship!

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,230
Tra-guy-san!

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,660
Sanji!

145
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,640
Damn! I'm on the ship again!

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,930
Caesar!

147
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,280
Oh, Giolla! Help me!

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,110
I'm being held captive, too!

149
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,050
I dropped my guard.

150
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,820
Sanji-kun!

151
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,030
Nami-san!

152
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,030
No! Doflamingo's coming again!

153
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,070
Damn!

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Black Foot-ya!

155
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,790
How's the plan to destroy
the factory going?

156
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,350
We found out where it is

157
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,510
but Franky said it's gonna
be harder than we thought.

158
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,190
How's my father?! And Kanjuro?!

159
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,330
San-goro!

160
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,420
How are they doing?!

161
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,890
Momonosuke.

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,570
The samurai is heading to the factory.

163
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,230
He'll be alright once everything is over.

164
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,000
So we need more time.

165
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,580
Hey, you!
Is that my heart?!

166
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,990
Were you keeping it in the cabin?!

167
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,080
This is mine.

168
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,010
I had your heart with me.

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,510
Damn!

170
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,300
Y-You had it in your body the whole time!

171
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,060
Everyone!

172
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,210
I want you to take him
and head for Zou!

173
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,380
Zou?

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,050
I gave you the Vivre Card
that leads you to the island.

175
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,120
Is this a Vivre Card?

176
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,660
Yes. It'll point toward an island called Zou
that I talked about earlier.

177
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,390
Here it is.

178
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,740
Head for the island?!

179
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,020
What about Luffy-san and the others?!

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
The only thing left to do on this island is
destroy the factory.

181
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,070
We'll catch up with you guys soon.

182
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,770
No! We'll wait!

183
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,780
We can't set sail without our captain!

184
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,080
We're the Straw Hats!

185
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,210
What?!

186
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,150
The Navy ship is flying towards us!

187
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,550
How is that possible?!

188
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,930
It must be Fujitora.

189
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,690
Doflamingo is coming from that way!

190
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,590
The Navy ship is getting closer!

191
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,590
No!

192
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,970
You can wait here if you want
but don't let them take Caesar!

193
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,270
Fire!

194
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,350
Something's falling from the sky!

195
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,190
Meteorites?!

196
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,340
Room!

197
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,630
Tra-guy-kun, we "Spiral Hats" are
gonna leave now!

198
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,200
I agree!

199
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Just go!

200
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,070
Hey, Law!

201
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,570
I realize we have
to carry Caesar as far as possible.

202
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,010
It's clear we have to leave here now.

203
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,400
But I thought Dressrosa was just a waypoint.

204
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,220
Our main purpose was killing Kaido
of the Four Emperors, wasn't it?

205
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,140
Aren't you getting too hung up
on Doflamingo?

206
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,310
Meteorites! Meteorites!

207
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,060
Takt!

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,410
Issho-san, they hit the bottom of our ship!

209
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,670
Oops, I hadn't thought about that.
Law-san is there, isn't he?

210
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,030
Why don't you stop eating?!

211
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
What's the matter?

212
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,510
Let's get back to Dressrosa now.

213
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,110
What?!

214
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,070
The tide of the war...

215
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,320
...will turn, it seems.

216
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,920
Tell them to turn around!

217
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,020
Yes, sir!

218
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,470
Everybody, ready?!

219
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm ready!

220
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,410
I'm ready, Nami-san!

221
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,670
I won't let you get away!

222
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,520
The whip, again!

223
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,690
Joker! Help me!

224
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,090
Excess Whip String!

225
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,160
Nami-ya! Listen.

226
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,770
You have to sail where there are no clouds!

227
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,280
What?! Why?!

228
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,410
Doflamingo is a String-String Fruit eater!

229
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,420
He moves through the air
by attaching strings to clouds!

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,320
He can't follow you if there are no clouds!

231
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,950
Strings? I see!

232
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,590
Just go now!

233
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,290
Get ready for Coup de Burst!

234
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,500
Doflamingo, look!

235
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,900
Law, what do you think you're doing?!

236
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,280
Young Master-sama, don't worry about me!

237
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,170
Hey you!
I want to ask you something!

238
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,070
Hey, you on the second floor!

239
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm talking to you! Say something!

240
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,390
Hey, can't you hear me?!

241
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,430
You, right there!

242
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,050
Hey!

243
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,770
I just met my hero - Luffy-senpai today

244
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,400
but now, Zoro-senpai is talking to me!

245
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,700
I can't stop crying from happiness!

246
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,440
He's acting strange.

247
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,300
I wonder who he is.

248
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,320
Hey, I don't know who you are

249
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,390
but can you tell us how to enter the Colosseum?

250
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,880
All the doors are closed!

251
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,480
Z-Zoro-senpai is asking me a question!

252
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm so glad that I sailed out to the sea!

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,870
What is he talking about?

254
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,560
Seems like he got very excited.

255
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,230
Hey, calm down and listen. We're...

256
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,520
I wish you were there to see it, Zoro-senpai!

257
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,040
Luffy-senpai was awesome as hell!

258
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,880
I just heard him say Luffy-dono
and Zoro-dono's names now!

259
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,120
Why does he know who you two are?

260
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,960
I don't know.

261
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
Now, the battle royal here
in the Corrida Colosseum!

262
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,210
Only one winner from Block D can
move to the finals!

263
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,450
They are all fighting intensely
to get that one spot!

264
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,990
The way she moves...

265
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,860
I don't think she's just another gladiator.

266
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,370
But why?

267
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,820
Why doesn't she make an
attack even passing up

268
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,840
some critical chances?

269
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,030
What is she doing?!
She's at the edge of the ring!

270
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,600
You'd better worry about yourself
before you worry about someone else!

271
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,670
Rebecca will be fine.

272
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,570
Go get them!

273
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,950
Hey, stop backing up!

274
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,710
You're at the edge now!

275
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,020
All right! Stay at it!

276
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,650
It's not all right!

277
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,020
Well, you'll see.

278
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,230
Prepare for death, you little tramp!

279
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,210
Go to hell, Rebecca!

280
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,340
Just finish her off!

281
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Drop dead!

282
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,850
See?

283
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,220
That's my girl, Rebecca!

284
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,060
What?

285
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,870
What did she just do?

286
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,910
Yeah, we barely outran
the Navy and Doflamingo.

287
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,480
We're gonna head for Zou.

288
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,850
Huh? No, wait, Sanji!
Are you gonna leave us?!

289
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,100
Sorry.

290
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,550
Get through somehow and meet us there.

291
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,210
What?!

292
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,190
I'm ready to get away
as soon as I have a chance!

293
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,920
You can't do that to me!

294
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
Sorry.

295
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,730
Sanji, we'll be alright!

296
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,870
You can go to Zou (elephant)
or Giraffe or wherever!

297
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm gonna destroy the factory for sure!

298
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,360
What are Luffy and Law doing?

299
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,660
Zoro and Kin'emon went
to tell Luffy what's going on.

300
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,340
Law is...

301
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,470
What's the point in letting half
of the Straw Hats get away?

302
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,630
The other half is in Dressrosa.

303
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,040
If I take them as hostages,
they'll come back

304
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,910
right away to return Caesar to me.

305
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,340
I thought that you knew
there are quite a few people...

306
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,120
...who underestimated them like that
and got burned.

307
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,860
I'm afraid that I have to break up my alliance
with the Straw Hats now.

308
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,040
When I joined forces with them,

309
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,440
my only purpose was to use them
to stop the manufacture of SMILEs.

310
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,650
Even if I can't kill you right now,

311
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,790
Kaido will kill you sooner or later
once you lose all the SMILEs.

312
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,150
I see.

313
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,560
So you're gonna sacrifice
yourself to kill me.

314
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,450
I want to see how the world
falls into a mess after you die,

315
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,630
but more importantly, I want to make
you pay for what you did 13 years ago.

316
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,150
Joker!
