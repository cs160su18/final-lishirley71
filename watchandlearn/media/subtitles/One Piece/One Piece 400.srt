2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,410
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,870
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,080
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,550
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,410
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,510
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,170
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,630
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,970
Make some waves...

22
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,520
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,230
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,890
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,520
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,480
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,650
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,780
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,490
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,290
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Make some waves...

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,340
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,740
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,680
after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,730
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,490
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

48
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,290
The crew, on its way to the New World,

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,470
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

50
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,480
After landing on the Sabaody Archipelago,

51
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,640
the Straw Hat crew succeeded in
rescuing the kidnapped Camie.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,280
However, a battle began
with marines lying in wait.

53
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,530
We're all set to escape!

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,160
The group then attempted to break
through the navy's siege and escape.

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,610
"Roger and Rayleigh
-- The King of the Pirates and His Right Hand Man"

56
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,720
Are you alive, Peterman-san?!

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,550
How dare they do this to our boss!

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,930
Dammit!

59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,960
Damn them!

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,430
Still...

61
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,080
I never expected Duval to have such
a handsome face under that mask!

62
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,460
Well, see ya! Feel free
to call us again anytime!

63
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,490
We'll be at your beck and call until you
can safely set sail for Fish-Man Island!

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,700
Okay! Thanks, you guys!

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,500
No problem at all!

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,540
Just quit winking.

67
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,290
Oh, and one other thing...

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,050
Don't forget this, Miss Mermaid!

69
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh! My backpack!

70
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,590
That idiot Peterman had it!

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,600
Thank you!

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,230
Alright! Let's go, Life is Rosy Riders!

73
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,320
Yes, Hand-Rose!

74
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,380
Their shouts sure change a lot.

75
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,400
They're probably trying
to find one that clicks.

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,700
Now, then. Let us hurry inside.

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,660
We need to get Hachi into a bed!

78
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,810
"Shakky's Rip-Off Bar"

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,890
Hey, Shakky! I'm back!

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,160
Oh, welcome back, Ray-san. That
was sooner than I expected.

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm impressed you guys managed to find him.

82
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,630
Ol' Hachi's been seriously hurt.
We need to get him into a bed.

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,780
What happened?!

84
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,260
This is bad! I'll get a bed ready right away!

85
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,390
Oh, you said you had something
to tell me afterward, old guy...

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,650
Eh?!

87
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,070
On the Pirate King's ship?!

88
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,280
Yes. I'm Silvers Rayleigh,
the ship's vice-captain.

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,370
Nice to meet you.

90
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,390
Vice-captain?!

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,320
You didn't tell them, Hatchan?

92
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,290
We only needed his help
with the coating, so...

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,510
Oh? You didn't realize it?

94
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,800
I know his name so well!

95
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,220
It's in so many books!

96
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,930
It's definitely a name everyone
hears at least once...

97
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,070
Gold Roger...

98
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,270
I seem to vaguely recall a rookie named
that long ago, but I'm not sure...

99
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,150
How do such a big-shot and
an octopus know each other?

100
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,410
Hachi rescued me over 20 years ago,
when I was stranded in the sea.

101
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,700
He saved his life. He was still
a child at the time, though.

102
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,850
Hachi and I remained close after that,
until he joined the Sun Pirates.

103
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,330
You mean Arlong, right?

104
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,720
Still...

105
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,260
Even though Gold Roger was
executed 22 years ago,

106
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,640
you didn't get your head chopped
off for being vice-captain?

107
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,060
The navy caught the entire crew, didn't it?

108
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
We weren't caught.

109
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,970
Roger turned himself in.

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,030
The government might've made it
sound like they had caught him

111
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,630
as a way to show its power, though.

112
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,390
The King of the Pirates
turned himself in?! Why?!

113
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,190
Because we saw an end to our journey.

114
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,740
About four years before the
day of his public execution,

115
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,790
Roger caught a fatal illness.

116
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
Not even Roger could avoid the suffering

117
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,800
that this terminal,
incurable disease brought.

118
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,440
But, there was one man with the
skill to ease his suffering:

119
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,720
a man at the Twin Capes named Crocus,

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,020
who was the most respected lighthouse
keeper and doctor in the sea.

121
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,400
We asked for his help and brought him
on as ship doctor for our final voyage.

122
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,440
Finally, three years later,
while managing to escape death,

123
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,530
Roger achieved what was
said to be impossible:

124
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,210
he conquered the Grand Line.

125
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,860
C-C-Crocus-san?!

126
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,380
At the Twin Capes?!

127
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,760
Oh, that brings back memories!

128
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,620
Huh?! That old guy wasn't
there for 50 years straight?!

129
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,780
He was a member of the Pirate King's crew?!

130
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,540
Come to think of it, he did mention
being a ship's doctor for a few years!

131
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,020
So he was a pirate for
those three years, then?!

132
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,800
The fact that you've met him
must mean he's still doing well!

133
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,080
Crocus agreed to come aboard

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,280
because there was a certain group
of pirates he wanted to look for.

135
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,160
Brook! It was you guys he set
out to find, no doubt about it!

136
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,670
Crocus-san...! You even
went to such lengths...!

137
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,080
He was only a crewmember for three years,

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
but he was unquestionably one of us!

139
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,680
At this age now, it'd be
great to see him again...

140
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,220
So, what happened after he conquered the sea?

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,890
That's when it all began.

142
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,110
The world started calling
Roger "King of the Pirates."

143
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,140
He hadn't been King of the Pirates
the entire time before or anything.

144
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,080
Titles hold no meaning
for a man about to die.

145
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,190
But Roger was overjoyed.

146
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,510
He loved doing everything in a flashy way...

147
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,960
Whether it was celebrating or fighting...

148
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,790
He even seemed to enjoy thinking
out a plan for the future,

149
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,170
even though he wouldn't be a part of it.

150
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,430
Eventually, as per captain's orders, the
Roger Pirates were secretly disbanded.

151
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,830
One by one, everyone discretely left.

152
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,850
As comrades, we all risked
our lives together,

153
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,520
but I know almost nothing about where
they are or what they're doing now.

154
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,680
Then, about a year after we disbanded,

155
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,860
Roger turned himself in and was arrested.

156
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,640
It was then announced that
he would be publicly executed

157
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,500
in Loguetown, the East
Blue town he was born in.

158
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,820
I hear that many of the young
faces in the town square that day

159
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,610
went on to make names for themselves
on the high seas today.

160
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,780
The world focused its attention
on the Pirate King's execution.

161
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,480
I didn't attend it.

162
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,360
The final words he said went like this...

163
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,420
I'm not going to die, partner...

164
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,900
The World Government and the
navy must've been shocked.

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
With only one last remark from Roger,

166
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,030
the public execution meant to serve
as an example to other pirates

167
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,040
instead became the opening
ceremony of the Great Pirate Age!

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,460
My treasure?

169
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,420
If you want it, you can have it!

170
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,870
Find it!

171
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,290
I left everything this
world has to offer there!

172
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,730
In his last few seconds, he
changed the dim flame of his life

173
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,180
into a hellfire that spread across the world!

174
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,210
I've never laughed as much
as I did on that night.

175
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,490
Nor have I ever cried as much...

176
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,320
...or drank as much as I did on that night.

177
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,070
Our captain lived one hell of a life!

178
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,690
It's like we just heard something incredible!

179
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,890
It's almost like a different story,
hearing it from someone who was there!

180
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,290
Then it's almost as if Roger created
this Great Pirate Era on purpose!

181
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,120
That... we still can't say.

182
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,630
Roger is dead.

183
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,580
Only the people living
now can create this era.

184
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,190
I'm certain there are people who
inherited something from Roger

185
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,980
on that day in the town square.

186
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,200
Your good friend, Shanks,
is probably one of them.

187
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,310
Eh? You know Shanks, old guy?

188
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,480
Have you also heard of the East
Blue pirate known as Buggy?

189
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,650
Buggy...

190
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,120
The two of them were apprentices on our ship.

191
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,750
Eh?! Shanks was on the Pirate King's ship?!

192
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,000
What? He didn't tell you about that?

193
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,720
I ran into him again on these
islands about 10 years ago,

194
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,010
and he'd lost his trademark straw
hat, along with his left arm.

195
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,180
When I asked what had happened,
he cheerfully spoke about you.

196
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,520
It was a real shock, Rayleigh-san!

197
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,650
There was a kid in East Blue who said
the same thing Captain Roger did.

198
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,360
Those same words of our captain!

199
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,330
And I've wanted to meet you--
Monkey D. Luffy-- ever since.

200
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,040
Shanks!

201
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:50,050
I'm afraid I can't, in good mind, babble
on about things Shanks hasn't told you.

202
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,720
In any case, you've done
well to come this far!

203
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,670
I'm sure he's eagerly waiting
for you in the New World.

204
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,830
Really?! Do you think so?! I
can't wait to see him, too!

205
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,070
Now, then. Let's get down to business.

206
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,430
You wanted your ship coated, is that right?

207
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,060
I should get back to my real work, anyway.

208
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,650
That reminds me, coating
costs a lot of money...

209
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,580
No, that's all right, Hachi. I can't
take money from friends of yours.

210
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,290
That's a relief. Thank you, Rayleigh.

211
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,010
I dunno why, but he's doing it for free!

212
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,010
We appreciate it! You're one generous guy!

213
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,470
It sounds like we just saved a ton of money!

214
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,230
Rayleigh-san.

215
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,230
I have a question!

216
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,980
What exactly is the "Will of D"?

217
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,320
Roger's name was engraved in ancient writing

218
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,120
on Poneglyph I saw on a sky island.

219
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,460
How was he able to use that writing?!

220
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,720
"I made it here. I will guide this
text to the ends of the earth."

221
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,990
"Pirate Gol D. Roger"

222
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,580
Do you people know what happened to the world

223
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,960
during the Blank Century
that began 900 years ago?!

224
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,980
Yes. We know.

225
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,320
We learned the entirety of history.

226
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,380
But, Miss. You mustn't be hasty.

227
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,770
Continue to move forward one
step at a time on your own ship.

228
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,590
We-- and Ohara-- might have
hurried a bit too much.

229
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,050
Even if I told you everything
about history right here,

230
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,350
you still wouldn't be able to
do anything as you are now.

231
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,980
Once you've taken the time to see the world,

232
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,400
it's possible you'll be led to
a different answer than we were.

233
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,270
But, if you still insist on hearing it,

234
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,260
I can tell you everything
about this world right now.

235
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,460
No, I'll pass. I'll continue my journey.

236
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,920
It will all come into sight someday.

237
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,930
I'm sorry for what happened
to your homeland of Ohara.

238
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,780
However, Roger didn't decipher that writing!

239
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,900
We're pirates.

240
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,030
We can't possibly match
the intellect of geniuses

241
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,980
like Clover and the scholars of Ohara.

242
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,400
He heard the voice of the
universe, that's all.

243
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,660
Whoa, are you sure, Robin?!

244
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,950
Are you sure you didn't just
pass up an incredible chance?!

245
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,580
Umm, old guy! There's one
more thing I wanna ask!

246
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,000
The legendary great treasure, the One Piece!

247
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,870
Is it really--?!

248
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,960
Usopp!

249
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,830
I don't wanna know where the treasure is!

250
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,100
I don't wanna know if the
treasure exists or not!

251
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,140
We've put all our lives on
the line and set out to sea,

252
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,980
even though we don't know anything!

253
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,690
I'd rather give up being a pirate than
have the old guy tell us stuff now!

254
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,240
I won't go on a boring adventure!

255
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,280
S-S-Sorry! I knew that, but it
just slipped out of my mouth...!

256
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,040
I-I don't wanna know, either!

257
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,690
Oh, I forgot! I have the "I'll Die If
I Learn About the One Piece" disease!

258
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,440
Hold on, old guy! Don't say anything!

259
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,420
Do you think you can do it?

260
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:07,070
The Grand Line still far surpasses
anything you can imagine!

261
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,560
Your foes will be powerful, too.

262
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,030
Can you rule this mighty sea?!

263
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not gonna rule anything!

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,160
It's the freest person in this sea
who's the King of the Pirates!

265
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,710
I see...

266
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,660
I really am a fan of yours, Monkey-chan.

267
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,810
Your ship is in Grove #41, was it?

268
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,900
I think I'll head over there.

269
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,800
What will you do?

270
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,260
There could be an admiral on
these islands as we speak.

271
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,300
We'll only be a nuisance if we stay here,

272
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,620
so maybe we should go shopping somewhere?!

273
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,320
What is this, "Laid-Back Life"?!

274
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,750
We're being chased! We gotta hide, you idiot!

275
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,360
Yeah. The people chasing us might
show up if we all stay together.

276
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,240
It'll help him finish the work more
smoothly if we lay low in town.

277
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,870
Then let's just split up and then
meet back there when he's all done.

278
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,710
Who're you to talk strategically about
meeting up and stuff like that?!

279
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,050
Shakky. Do we have any?

280
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,880
Yes, there's one left.

281
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,420
This is a Vivre Card!

282
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,800
Oh, if you know what it is,
that simplifies things.

283
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,610
Since I happen to be a bit notorious myself,

284
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,770
I think I'll move it from Grove #41 to
somewhere else before I start on it.

285
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,730
I'll need three days to complete the coating.

286
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,960
It takes three whole days?!

287
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,890
Your life depends on this work.
It's the fastest I can go.

288
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,520
I guess it's three days of
wilderness survival then!

289
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,990
How frightening!

290
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,090
Sundown in three days, let's say.

291
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,530
I don't know what grove I'll be on then,
so wherever the Vivre Cards lead you,

292
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,440
I'll be there finishing the
coating and waiting for you.

293
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,000
You should probably also
buy whatever you'll need

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,220
for your underwater voyage
to Fish-Man Island.

295
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,750
Luffy-chin! Everyone! Thank you so much!

296
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,930
Yeah! Thanks so much!

297
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,430
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble!

298
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,640
I can't thank you guys enough!

299
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,940
We'll show you the way to Fish-Man
Island, so don't worry about a thing!

300
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,190
Watch out for the navy
for the next three days!

301
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,520
Hachi! Get plenty of bed rest!

302
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,400
Let's meet again in three
days. We'll see you off.

303
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,230
See you later, lady!

304
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,620
We're up against an admiral! We gotta
make sure none of us gets killed!

305
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,210
Don't say unlucky things like that!

306
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,630
Three days, huh...

307
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,920
Alright! Let's go!

308
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,030
To the amusement park!

309
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,050
Hey, now!

310
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,480
A navy warship's been
spotted from the harbor!

311
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,680
The admiral's here!

312
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,280
This is Kizaru.

313
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,110
I've arrived.

314
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,950
Please respond.

315
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,380
Is the admiral really coming?

316
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,760
I don't want to meet him!

317
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,370
The one we met before, Aokiji, was crazy
strong with that freezing Devil Fruit power!

318
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,510
Oh, dear! I bet the other
admirals have powers, too!

319
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,470
I'm scared!

320
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

321
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,310
"No Escape!? Admiral Kizaru's
Light Speed Kick!!"

322
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,610
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
