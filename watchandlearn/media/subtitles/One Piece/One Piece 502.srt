2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,400
After losing his brother Ace during
the War of the Best against the Navy,

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,950
Luffy was consumed with unbearable sorrow.

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,780
However, 10 years ago, in the East Blue...

62
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,740
What did you do?!

63
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,200
Ace!

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,730
Don't do it!!

65
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,800
"Where can freedom be found?
A Sad Departure of a Boy!"

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,960
Dadan!

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,440
Stop it, you sea cretin!

68
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,900
Let go of Ace!

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,630
What are you guys doing here?

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,630
Finally we found you!

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,060
These are pretty serious
wounds, Luffy! Are you okay?

72
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,580
Dogra...

73
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,760
I don't see Sabo anywhere!

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,400
Sabo went home. He's not here.

75
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,620
Ace!

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,160
You're the boss monkey from Mt. Corvo!

77
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,290
I'm the mountain bandit - Dadan!

78
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,080
I don't know why but I'm registered
as their foster parent.

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,560
I won't stand by and watch someone
try to take my boys' lives...

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,540
...even if I'm not their real parent!

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,050
I'll just let you go if you back away.

82
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,140
If you don't, I'll have
to resort to violence!

83
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,060
Try it!

84
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,940
Oh yeah? Alright then...

85
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,620
Run!

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,530
Yes, boss!

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Hey, what're you doing?!

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,220
Ace, hurry up!

89
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,790
Ace!

90
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,480
I...

91
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,010
...won't run!

92
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,850
What're you saying, Ace?!
Don't try to fight him!

93
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,970
Bluejam is a real villain!

94
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,650
He's not a guy that a kid like you can beat!

95
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,270
--L-Let me fight, too!
--No, Luffy!

96
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,240
You all, why don't you
take Luffy and go ahead!

97
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,740
B-Boss!

98
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,290
I'll take responsibility
for bringing Ace home!

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,390
Boss!

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,340
Go!

101
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,090
--Y-Yes, ma'am!
--Ace!

102
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,680
Boss! Come home safely!

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,810
A woman and a child.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,730
If you overestimate your
ability, you'll only get hurt!

105
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,610
Only the strong and the
cowardly survive in wars!

106
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,820
The brave always die.

107
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,510
Is that so?

108
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
What a fool!

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,800
Damn!

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,010
I'm a dead man! The fire
is all over the place!

111
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,510
How could this happen all of the sudden?!

112
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,890
--It's hot! It's hot!
--There's no way out!

113
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,320
We have to give up!

114
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,180
What just happened?

115
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,760
There's a path!

116
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,460
The explosion left a path!

117
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,560
I don't know what's going
on but this is great!

118
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,710
Hey look, there is a ship!

119
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,440
I see a ship!

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,040
This path leads up to the shore!

121
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,600
We can get away by following it!

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,620
Let's go before the fire returns!

123
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,790
How awful they are to burn the
area and the residents there!

124
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,100
By the way,

125
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,870
how did you know the situation in such
an outlying country in the East Blue?

126
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,930
Is there something special
about this country?

127
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,930
This country is an example of how
the world will be in the future.

128
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,130
There can be no happiness in a world

129
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,630
where the undesirables are thrown away.

130
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,160
Someday, I will change the world!

131
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,820
If I stay here... I'll never be free!

132
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,660
Even in a country like
this, there are children.

133
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,180
Those of you who are willing to
fight for freedom, come aboard!

134
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,400
GOA KINGDOM "ROYAL PALACE"

135
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,360
HIGH TOWN

136
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,450
Did they find Sabo?

137
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,830
I just called in the military.
They'll find him soon.

138
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,440
I see. Sabo is giving us
a hard time, isn't he?

139
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,380
Yeah...

140
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,700
Is this town really safe?

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,680
It looks like the fire will
engulf the town any minute!

142
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,470
Isn't there any way to enter High Town?

143
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,820
No, there isn't.

144
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,020
They don't even allow a bug
to enter - nobles only!

145
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,740
--Boss!
--Boss!

146
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,950
Ace!

147
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,070
Boss!

148
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,370
Ace!

149
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,140
Boss!

150
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:56,420
Ace and Dadan didn't return
from the burning Gray Terminal.

151
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,310
Easy, easy, wait, Luffy. You're not
recovered - where're you going?

152
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,330
I gotta go and look for Ace and Dadan!

153
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,820
You can't do that!

154
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,420
Ouch!

155
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,200
See? That's what I told you.

156
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,130
You're seriously wounded. You
have to rest nice and easy.

157
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,720
There are a lot of troops
in the Gray Terminal now

158
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,920
to take care of the mess after the fire.

159
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,800
It's not just burned junk
that they're throing out,

160
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,640
but survivors, too.

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,440
They're gonna kill you if you go there.

162
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,980
But...!

163
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,990
I wanna see Ace!

164
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,090
I know that Sabo is worrying about us, too!

165
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,540
THE FORMER SITE OF THE GRAY TERMINAL

166
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,880
What a great view!

167
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,520
How can you be so happy?

168
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,180
It's a pain in the butt
to clean up this mess!

169
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,040
If we find a survivor, we're
to shoot them on sight.

170
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
There aren't any.

171
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,780
But there aren't as many dead
bodies as I thought there'd be.

172
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,110
It was a big fire. It could've
burned out the bones.

173
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,770
I was nervous yesterday,

174
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,370
thinking that the
fire might get to this side of the wall.

175
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,870
They say that Bluejam's
ship was on fire, too.

176
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,890
It's nice to know that
those villains got burned!

177
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,960
It's morning!

178
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,740
Hi! it's a nice day, isn't it?

179
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,620
Yes, it is a lovely morning!

180
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,100
There are still so many of them!

181
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,640
Enough with this game of tag, okay boy?

182
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,120
No matter how many times you
run, you can't get away, Sabo!

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,750
All the police and troops
have a picture of you now!

184
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,230
You will never get out of High Town...

185
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,840
or even out of this house!

186
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,670
You two, change your uniforms and
start working here as guards.

187
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,730
But we have our duties...

188
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,540
There is nothing that a nobleman can't do.

189
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,110
I'll get the approval of your superiors.

190
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,920
Sabo, you must barricade
yourself in your room

191
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,380
and educate yourself in your role as a noble!

192
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,330
No!

193
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,290
As you know, I can make things
happen just by giving the word.

194
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,500
So I can take care of
you or those two easily.

195
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
Am I understood?

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,540
Dad...

197
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,510
Ace... Luffy...

198
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,070
So why don't you mend your ways
and study hard like Stelly.

199
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,480
And...

200
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,160
...study so that you can make your parents,

201
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,620
who brought you into the world, happy!

202
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,790
Because that will make you happy, too!

203
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,830
Don't you think so?

204
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,140
Father!

205
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't worry! I'm here for you!

206
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,510
You're so dependable, Stelly!

207
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,390
Okay, Let me buy you some luxurious clothes

208
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,720
for the ceremony the day after tomorrow.

209
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,610
There, we'll see the
Celestial Dragon in person!

210
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm... helpless!

211
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,120
Okay, that's it for today.

212
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,710
I'll check your homework tomorrow.

213
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,390
Okay, have a nice day!

214
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,350
Ace... Luffy...

215
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,820
I don't think that you died in the fire.

216
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
You guys are okay, aren't you?

217
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,620
I wish I could see you.

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,550
But I know I'll put you guys in
danger if I try to see you now.

219
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,260
This place is like a birdcage!

220
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,540
I don't think I can stand living in
this country filled with stale air.

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,740
What is freedom?

222
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,280
Where can I find it?

223
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,280
Your shift is over.

224
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,910
Is it the time already?

225
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,040
You shouldn't be sleeping on the job.

226
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,920
Sorry. By the way, how
are things in the town?

227
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,080
The ceremony is just a day away, right?

228
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,050
It's crazy. People are going
wild getting ready for it.

229
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,120
What bad luck!

230
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,760
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing but I got to be here.

231
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,600
This boy and I will be the only
two in this house tomorrow.

232
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,400
I wanted to see the Celestial Dragon.

233
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,530
It depends on your attitude.

234
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,820
All the citizens will be
at the harbor tomorrow.

235
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,430
It'll be such a pain to stand guard there,

236
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,260
compared with this baby-sitting gig!

237
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,040
Then, why don't you take my place?

238
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,780
No way!

239
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,050
Alright, we're leaving now.

240
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,440
Take good care of Sabo.

241
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,430
Yes, sir.

242
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,580
The day of the World Noble
from the Grand Line's visit

243
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,410
to the Goa Kingdom has arrived.

244
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,090
A lavish ceremony is prepared
for the arrival of the ship.

245
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,720
Ring, ring, ring... Ring,
ring, ring... Clank!

246
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Hello, this is A-team on the coast.

247
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,490
The Celestial Dragon's ship
will arrive in a few minutes.

248
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,000
Roger that. It's all quiet here.

249
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,360
We'll continue to stand guard.

250
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Clank!

251
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,080
Hey, look! There is a ship leaving port!

252
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,420
--What?
--Is it a fishing boat?

253
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,730
Hey! Come back here! Don't get
in the way of the ceremony!

254
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,920
It's a child! There's a child on the ship!

255
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,990
A child? I wonder which family he's from.

256
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,440
A child?

257
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,730
Honey, could it be...?!

258
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,220
No, that's impossible! The
guard is looking after him!

259
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,590
What a nice day! It's
perfect for setting sail!

260
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:49,030
Oh no! That's mine! Somebody
stole my fish boat!

261
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,840
Look! He has a black flag on it!

262
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,430
Does he think that he's a pirate?!

263
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,110
No way! A kid can't just become a pirate!

264
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,780
--Where is he heading?
--He's disrupting the ceremony.

265
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,990
The Government's ship will arrive soon!

266
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,660
Hurry up and do something!

267
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,130
Y-Yes, sir!

268
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,830
Hey!

269
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,830
Kid, come back here now!

270
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,630
The scariest fate for me is to
lose myself in this country and...

271
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,550
turn into someone else!

272
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,640
I'm not gonna go back!

273
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,980
Is it Sabo on that ship?

274
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,000
The Government's ship is here!

275
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,900
The ship is huge!

276
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,440
I'll die if I crash into it.

277
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,590
Let's avoid that.

278
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,850
Good. He's turning away.

279
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,390
It seems like the commoners are welcoming us.

280
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,450
Yes.

281
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,240
They're so blessed that
it's rare to even see them!

282
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,290
I can't believe that a real
Celestial Dragon is on that ship!

283
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,300
By the way, what is that?

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
That looks like a fish boat.

285
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,600
It'd be nice to be captain
of a ship like that someday!

286
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,060
Commoner!

287
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,570
How rude is that!

288
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,210
The fishing boat has been hit!

289
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,390
Ace and Dadan return to their hideout.

290
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,640
As everyone is rejoicing
over their safe return,

291
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,360
they learn of the tragedy
that struck Sabo at the port.

292
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Realizing with sympathy
what Sabo had tried to do,

293
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
Luffy and Ace are befallen
by regret and grief.

294
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
On the next episode of One Piece!

295
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,010
"Take Good Care of Him! A
Letter from the Brother!"

296
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,470
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
