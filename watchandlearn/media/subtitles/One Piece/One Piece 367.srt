2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,000
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,100
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,650
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,780
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,580
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,300
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,850
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,400
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,990
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,120
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,870
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,420
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,670
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,010
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,100
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,730
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,070
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,440
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,530
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,540
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,710
Let's press forward

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,090
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,420
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Make some waves...

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,790
Wealth, fame, power...

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,430
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,320
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
The words he uttered just before his death

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,820
drove people around the world to the seas.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,480
My treasure? If you want it, you can have it!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,790
Find it! I left everything
this world has to offer there!

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,750
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

46
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,240
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,180
Smooch...!

48
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,270
What?! W-Wait! What're you doing?!

49
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,730
No, stop it!

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
Curse you, Namizo!

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,950
Damn it, Lola! Not only
did you crash my wedding,

52
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,950
but now you have the gall
to attack my bride?!

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,290
Run for it, Namizo! I will hold him back!

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,250
I came to rescue you, my friend!

55
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,380
Lola!

56
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,050
Ab-sama!

57
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,550
Stay out of my way!

58
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,020
You've made me... waste my energy on you!

59
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,900
How dare you hurt Lola?!

60
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,150
Swing Arm!

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,180
It's not like that'll do anything!
That's why I'm going to...

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,620
Huh?

63
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,840
I won! Yay!

64
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,780
Hey, Oars!

65
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,010
If Luffy's shadow is inside of you...

66
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,520
...you shouldn't underestimate the
underlying strength of your crew!

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,360
"Knock Him Down!!
Special Attack: Straw Hat Docking?"

68
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,670
I'll be just fine, Namizo.

69
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,050
You can go on without me.

70
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,630
I'll get you up to speed with
what's happening here on the island.

71
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,090
Lola!

72
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,880
You know your friend, Straw Hat Luffy?

73
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,110
Well, the Special Zombie
that possesses his shadow

74
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,100
is running amok on the island.

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,390
The Special Zombie...?

76
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,820
It's time! Awaken!

77
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,450
Meat!

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,100
She must mean him.

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,240
Now get going! You can leave him to me.

80
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,440
Thank you, Lola!

81
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,350
Lookie, Ab-sama! It's just the two of us.

82
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,910
Let's savor the moment!

83
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,980
The massive zombie I saw in
the freezer room spells trouble!

84
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,650
Will we be able to tear Luffy's
shadow out of that monster?

85
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,770
But there is no way we're
leaving empty-handed

86
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,910
after what they've put us through!

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
Bingo! The door is even open.

88
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,260
It... It... It's empty!

89
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,640
No way! Where'd my treasure go?!

90
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,650
There isn't a trace of it left!

91
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm sure this is the place! So who took it?

92
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,900
Oh, look! That's the woman who escaped.

93
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
You're right. It's her!

94
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,860
Aren't they...?

95
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,320
Sweet! Let's report this!

96
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Report time!

97
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,910
Stop right there!

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,790
You have impeccable timing.

99
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,640
I'm dying to ask you two a question.

100
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,180
You sure are tough, puny pirates!

101
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,630
Just throwing this out there, but what
do you think of sending him flying?

102
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,380
What?! S-Seriously, Zoro?

103
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,360
I hear you...

104
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Wha--?!

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,920
I bet that'd be a blast.

106
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,260
S-Stop right there!
Wh-When you said, "sending him flying,"

107
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,040
did you really mean that behemoth?!

108
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,560
I nearly had a heart attack when that
lummox started moving around like Luffy.

109
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,770
Still, he isn't fit to be
the King of the Pirates.

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,690
The question is how to topple him over.

111
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,240
We can go about it more ways than one.

112
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,990
He must have a weakness somewhere!

113
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:40,080
It's standard to slowly weaken
a large fish over time...

114
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,390
At any rate...

115
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,580
...he's super scary!

116
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Go crunch!

117
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,130
Here he comes!

118
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,390
Gum-Gum...

119
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,150
...Butt Drop!

120
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,310
That attack is nuts!

121
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,560
Scatter!

122
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,530
Gum-Gum...

123
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,740
Franky, he's going after you!

124
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,450
...Hammer!

125
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,960
Punk! You're just beggin' me
to teach you who's boss.

126
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,920
Behold our forces combined!

127
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Guys!

128
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,140
It's time for Tactics #15!

129
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,550
What?!

130
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,290
You want to do that right here and now?!

131
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,860
Zoro! Curly! Enter standby!

132
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,320
Standby?

133
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,730
Just hold my legs!

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,530
What the heck are they up to?

135
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,740
Here we come!

136
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,450
Let's do it!

137
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,240
Pirates Docking: Six!

138
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,750
Giant Robot Warrior!

139
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,370
Big Emperor!

140
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,050
Hold up, Franky!

141
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,170
Is there a problem, Chopper?

142
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,430
She still hasn't docked onto your left arm!

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,640
What?!

144
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,770
Hey! What's keeping you, Nico Robin?!

145
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,140
Dock onto my left arm already!

146
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,690
Robin, hurry!

147
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,900
Come, Robin! Copy what I'm doing!

148
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,860
No.

149
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,320
That would hurt my human pride.

150
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,950
It'd hurt...

151
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,830
...her...

152
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,700
...h-h-human--

153
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,540
It would hurt my human pride.

154
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,250
She said it twice!

155
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,460
So you're not going to dock?

156
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,130
Why do you sound so shocked?

157
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,220
Poopy! You got me worked up for nothing!

158
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,390
Do it!

159
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,180
Dock with him!

160
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,730
--Oomph!
--Oomph!
--Oomph!

161
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,940
I suck! I can't believe they
duped me into doing that.

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,480
No, just forget about it!

163
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,110
Robin, we could have become Robot
Warrior Big Emperor if you'd joined us!

164
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,700
I never saw that betrayal coming! Never!

165
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,370
I bet Luffy would have
done it if he were here!

166
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,580
Don't ask me to dock with you... ever again!

167
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,800
Let's regroup, dammit!

168
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,220
--Franky!
--Huh?

169
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm gonna borrow your big toy.

170
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,520
Hey, punk! That's my Heavy Nunchaku!

171
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,850
Fine! You can borrow it.

172
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,940
The bastard...! I need to hurry back
to Nami-san and rescue her again.

173
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,450
See how you like a taste of this!

174
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,960
Was that you?

175
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,250
Robin!

176
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,590
Go for the joints after I whack his left arm!

177
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,180
Roger.

178
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,630
Here I go!

179
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,360
I could have sworn it was around here...

180
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,250
Found it! This is the place.

181
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,970
The coast is clear, right?

182
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm coming in!

183
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,260
It looks like someone
has ransacked the place.

184
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,210
But I'm sure they must have some in here...

185
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,690
C-C-Could that be...

186
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,860
...milk?!

187
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,490
As I am now, this is the ultimate medicine!

188
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,700
Now all that is left is to
check the expiration date...

189
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,210
Oh, dear...

190
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,580
What a pity...

191
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,250
No, this should just barely
be in the clear! It'll be okay!

192
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,590
I'll drink this for the sake of the others!

193
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,570
Bottoms up!

194
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,560
I can feel it! I can feel it!

195
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,900
I can feel it!

196
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,730
I can feel the calcium seeping
into every pore of my body!

197
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,150
But since I'm a skeleton,
I don't have any pores!

198
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
I am alive!

199
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,330
Oh, dear! That random outburst made
these poor eyes of mine see stars.

200
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,750
But since I'm a skeleton,
I don't have eyes...

201
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,050
Ah! This is hardly the time to waste
energy on such silly nonsense!

202
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:16,930
All right! I must find some quickly
and return to the others.

203
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,770
That screams "suspicious"...

204
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,370
Found it!

205
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,820
But I don't have a tongue...

206
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,700
Perona-sama!

207
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
What is it?

208
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,380
The fridge is stuffed! We can't
squeeze another morsel in.

209
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,840
Don't they have a pantry?
Put the provisions in there.

210
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Okay!

211
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,340
Hurry up with the treasure!
Don't leave a single gem behind!

212
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Okay!

213
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,020
Robin!

214
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,360
Go for the joints after I whack his left arm!

215
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,610
Roger.

216
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,010
Here I go!

217
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000
Over here, Monster Luffy!

218
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,290
Jerk! You're just a shrimp!

219
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,300
Gum-Gum...

220
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,630
Now, Usopp!

221
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,970
Got it!

222
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,930
Eat this!

223
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,720
Special Attack! Special Oil Star!

224
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,310
Three Chamber Shot!

225
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,190
--Hey, Curly!
--Huh?

226
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,570
Send me flying!

227
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,440
While you're swinging that huge thing around?

228
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,240
If you can't, that's cool.

229
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,780
Why, you...!

230
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,030
Of course I can, moron!

231
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,700
Armée de l'Air...

232
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,540
...Power Shoot!

233
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,710
Super Fencing!

234
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,080
Cien Fleurs!

235
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,650
Big Tree!

236
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,440
Wh-What's that?

237
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,110
Clutch!

238
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,300
Whoa,

239
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,290
this is dangerous!
I'm gonna fall! I'm about to fall!

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,090
Feast your eyes on this!
It's a super impromptu staircase!

241
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,880
Franky Skywalk!

242
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,010
Unfortunately, this stairway
won't last for long!

243
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,390
Let's get a move on, Chopper!

244
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,520
Yeah!

245
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,860
Super Frapper Gong!

246
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,200
Even if he's big, he still has the same
weak spots as any other person.

247
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,150
If we jolt his jaw, it will jolt his brain!

248
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:23,490
That one leg is the only thing
keeping you up, Monster Luffy!

249
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,690
Bad Manner...

250
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,420
...Kick...

251
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,730
...Course!

252
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,500
Bottoms up!

253
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Flip over, monster.

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
Nice! Go!

255
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,730
S-S-Sweet! Now do you see how strong we are?

256
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,610
Whatcha think of that, Monster Luffy?!

257
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,290
We just scored our first knockdown.

258
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,260
Wh-What was that?

259
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,930
Oh, man! You can barely
recognize the mansion now.

260
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,650
Who roughhouses like that?
Is it supposed to be a circus act?

261
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,030
W-Wait... You don't think
someone flipped him, do you?

262
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,320
Really! Try to use your head!

263
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,070
An army with a thousand men
couldn't pull that off!

264
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,120
Y-Yeah, but...

265
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,050
Why else would
he be flipped upside down?

266
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,290
Ah, ouch! Ow, ow, ow, ow...

267
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,200
You're a bunch of meanies!

268
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,790
Now I'm ticked! I'm gonna
send all of you flying!

269
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,880
No way...! Is Oars actually losing?

270
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,400
Oh, well.

271
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
I was mostly hanging out
with Moria-sama for fun.

272
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,850
I don't see the need to stick
around if I sense mortal danger.

273
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,110
Hurry it up, guys!
I'm leaving as soon as possible!

274
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,860
Okay!

275
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,660
All right, bring the rest
of the rations over here!

276
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,530
Sure thing!

277
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,630
Who're you? You don't look like a zombie!

278
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,090
What brings you here?

279
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,680
You're stinking huge!
You look like a bear [kuma].

280
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,930
Kuma? That was a good guess.

281
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,980
Is this... where I can find Moria?

282
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,010
If you could go on a trip,
where would you like to go?

283
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,760
Who are you? Are you after Luffy?

284
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,100
What do you want? Are you really
one of the Seven Warlords?

285
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,010
I am free to do as I like.

286
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,980
This guy is bad news!

287
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,640
I need to warn the others.

288
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,060
On the next episode of One Piece!

289
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,190
"The Silent Assault!!
The Mysterious Visitor, 'Tyrant' Kuma!"

290
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,240
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
