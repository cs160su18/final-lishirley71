2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,290
It's all right! Now let's move forward

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,670
with the sun always in our hearts

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,090
As power passes through our clasped hands

5
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
let's grab hold of our wishes

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,770
Working together, let's ride the giant waves

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,950
Let's hurry toward the excitement--
there's the starting signal

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Now's the time to set sail-- let's raise anchor

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,040
Cut through the rainbow-colored wind
and head for a sea of adventure

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,550
It'll be a journey fraught with injury

11
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,430
but what you cherish most will be right there

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,430
And if you get into a jam

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,430
I'll always be there to protect you

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,650
It's all right! Now let's move forward

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,150
with the sun always in our hearts

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,150
If a storm hits, let's put
our arms around each other

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,660
and gaze at the light beyond

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,370
If we gather up the pieces of our dreams

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,660
they'll make a map leading to tomorrow

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's grab hold of our wishes

21
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,460
under the same flag-- together, we're one

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
One Piece

23
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,270
Team Foxy wins yet again in the
second round of this second fight!

24
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,650
Now you've lost two crewmates.

25
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,740
One game remains, and you can only
take back one crew member at most.

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,030
So, even if you do beat me in this next game,

27
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,000
you've already lost one crewmate for good!

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,960
"The Captains Square Off!
The Final Combat Round!"

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,010
Now then, Boss!
Choose your bounty, if you please!

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,650
You're the second one I choose!

31
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,690
Oh, Choppy! I won't leave you ever again!

32
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,030
Robin!

33
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,530
Don't cry, Doctor.

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,910
Hey, things are looking pretty bad!

35
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,420
What are we gonna do, Luffy?!

36
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't worry! We'll just do
another Davy Back Fight!

37
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,920
Another one?

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,220
Forget it.

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,180
Say, shall I tell you why we Foxy Pirates
are known as the mightiest of all?

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,940
--Heh. Says they're the mightiest.
--After losing to us twice.

41
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,020
Don't be like that...

42
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,110
We had five three-coin games

43
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,900
with the Fang-Frog Pirates
today before we ran into you.

44
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,330
Many of us are hurt. We're exhausted,
both mentally and physically...

45
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,410
We're ready to call it quits.

46
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,330
So we won't agree to any more fights,
however much you want one!

47
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,550
Knowing when enough is enough--
when it's time to quit--

48
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,550
is why we're the mightiest!

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,180
Wh-Why aren't you saying anything?

50
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,770
What a joke.

51
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,150
Acting like you're the
underdogs here... Are you an idiot?!

52
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,610
Is that what you call the "mightiest crew"?
What a bunch of Peanut crap.

53
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,120
How can you be so laid-back?!

54
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,540
We can't choose between Chopper and Robin!

55
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,700
Are we just gonna let 'em keep 'em?!

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,790
Don't be stupid! I'm gonna get both back!

57
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,710
And how do you plan to do that?!

58
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,920
What a pain. Maybe I
should just chop 'em all up...

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Uhh, this is a game, you know. A game...

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,390
Hey, "Boss"! I have an offer...

61
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,640
Huh?

62
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,310
What do you say we bet
five people on the next game?

63
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,530
--Hey, now! You can't just decide--!
--No, let's leave this to her.

64
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,610
Come again?

65
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,280
This game is all about taking
crew members you want, right?

66
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Well, we want those two!

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,240
There's no point to this if
we can't get 'em both back.

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,540
Huh?!

69
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,880
So, if we win the next game,
you'll give them back to us.

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,920
And if you win, all five of us
will join your crew too.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,430
What do you say? It's a pretty
good deal if you ask me...

72
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,760
This girl has some serious guts
to try and bargain with me...

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,930
Those two clearly have enormous power...

74
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,270
This one and his strange
implements could be useful...

75
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,730
And most valuable of all is this
guy worth 100 million Berries!

76
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,410
All right! Two is way too cheap, though!

77
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,160
I'll bet 500 people!

78
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,790
If you win, I'll give you 500 people,
including those two!

79
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,210
Wha...? Why 500?

80
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,960
Oh, my! Our boss has made
the "Hellish 500-Man Wager!"

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,550
Will Straw Hat accept?!

82
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,470
We don't need 500 people!
Are you stupid or something?!

83
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,550
You idiot!

84
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,430
We're so close to making a deal!
Don't back out now!

85
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,770
The Merry can't carry 500 people!

86
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,400
Getting Chopper and Robin-chan
back is all that matters!

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,310
Five or 500, it makes no difference!

88
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,270
Oh.

89
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,400
Do you accept?

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,320
Yeah! Of course!

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Incidentally, should the losing
team not have 500 people,

92
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,080
the remainder will be made up
by the team's descendants.

93
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,660
In other words, your children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren

94
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,380
will be forced to swear loyalty to
the Foxy Pirates until the total is met!

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,170
Children...?

96
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,930
Daddy!

97
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,930
Yes! What is it?

98
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,020
They've suddenly added a
strange condition to the mix...

99
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,600
We don't have much of a choice.

100
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,860
You just have to win! Understand, Luffy?!

101
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,060
Yeah! Leave it to me!

102
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,860
It's nice that you're raring to go and all,
but I should warn you now

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,530
that it's impossible to beat me
in the final combat round.

104
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,490
I suggest you all ready yourselves!

105
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,460
What?! I'd never lose to you in a fight!

106
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,420
How many times must I repeat myself?

107
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,170
A fight and a game are two different things...

108
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,350
Foxy!

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,390
At last, it's time for the final combat round!

110
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,810
First order of business:
establishing the battlefield!

111
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,190
The two competitors spin the cannon!

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,730
And then...

113
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,530
...wherever it stops will be where--!

114
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,570
Hold on! That was clearly not normal!

115
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,080
The battlefield has been set!

116
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,500
By sheer coincidence, it's on
the deck of our own Sexy Foxy!

117
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,540
Coincidence, my butt! You idiot!

118
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,500
I'll now explain the rules of combat!

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,970
Everything within 50 meters
of where the cannonball landed

120
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,720
is part of the battlefield!

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,890
In other words, it's a 100-meter-wide circle!

122
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,850
Weapons are allowed, as well as
anything else within the circle!

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,730
Only the two competitors
are allowed inside the circle!

124
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,570
Knock your opponent out of
the circle and you win! That's it!

125
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,990
Note that the air and water inside
the circle still counts as in-bounds!

126
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,990
F! O! X! Y!

127
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,200
Foxy!

128
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,500
The Flower Cheerleaders
are currently on the stage

129
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,330
performing cheers for our boss,

130
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,170
while an opening fight is
being held aboard the Foxy!

131
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,500
Additionally, the Association of Stalls

132
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,470
is selling limited-edition
Davy Back Fight merchandise,

133
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,180
so be sure to check them out!

134
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,510
We don't need any of this! Just get started!

135
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,930
"Foxy Pins"

136
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,430
--...please!
--Okay! Limited-edition Foxy pins!

137
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,020
Don't buy their junk!

138
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,150
--Excuse me. Where's the participant...?
--There! Just take him already!

139
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,150
What are you so mad about?

140
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,030
Sheesh! Why isn't anyone taking this seriously?!

141
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,120
It really ticks me off how their boss
is dictating the pace of everything!

142
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,870
I dunno, it's probably just 'cause
they've gained so many crew members...

143
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,040
They clearly have more than enough now!

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,500
All that matters is that Luffy wins, Nami-san!

145
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,880
I'll go buy us some drinks! Go on ahead!

146
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,350
Hey, you two! Come on over here!

147
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,180
Here! For you!

148
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,190
--How much is it?
--It's on the house!

149
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,770
Oh, thank you.

150
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,650
Oh, yeah! Even if Luffy loses,
they'll all be part of this team too!

151
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,910
We won't have to go our separate ways!

152
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,540
But if that happens, Captain
won't be our captain anymore.

153
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,210
We'll all be serving under a new boss...

154
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,010
--The King of the Pirates...
--...will be me!

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,260
You guys better work hard for me!

156
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,090
Yeah...

157
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,560
Say, Luffy's going to win, right?

158
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,690
All seven of us are gonna get
to continue our journey, right?!

159
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,650
Let's pray it turns out that way.

160
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,330
What the hell?! Why does popcorn
and a cola cost so much?!

161
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,580
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

162
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,750
--Lower it 80%!
--Get outta my face!

163
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,840
What is all this?!

164
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,710
This is the dressing room.

165
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,180
It's a gloved fight, so choose anything you like.

166
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,510
Awesome!

167
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,270
Wow, this is more like a costume
room than a dressing room...

168
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,850
Look at all this stuff! And I can
use anything I want, Usopp!

169
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,070
Hey, how about this? Does it look good?

170
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,320
No... This is it...

171
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
The boundaries are in place!

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,040
This ends the opening entertainment!
Thank you for your patience!

173
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,250
Now for today's main event...

174
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,010
Combat! The bell will ring shortly!

175
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,470
Hurry to the spectator stands, everyone!

176
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,930
What's happening?

177
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,190
The sky is turning dark...

178
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,570
Nami-san! Where are you?! Say something!

179
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,280
Watch where you're walkin', crappy cook.

180
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,830
This time we're being treated to
a captain-versus-captain battle!

181
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,090
--Beat 'im up, Boss!
--We're counting on you!

182
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,130
First, in the left figurehead corner...!

183
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,300
A man who takes on all challengers

184
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,260
and boasts a legendary, undefeated
record of 920 wins and 0 losses!

185
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,730
Boss!

186
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,730
Our boss, Silver Fox Foxy!

187
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,570
All right...

188
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,490
Listen up, Luffy. You ain't your old self no more.

189
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,500
That hairstyle arouses a man's true wildness.

190
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,420
Some ask if the champion makes the afro,
or if the afro makes the champion...

191
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,460
Not even modern science can explain it.

192
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,050
Luffy... With an afro on, your punches
will have some serious firepower.

193
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,640
--Where's Straw Hat?!
--Did he wimp out on us?!

194
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,850
Let's do it, Pops.

195
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,310
Oh, yeah!

196
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,230
And in the right corner, hailing from East Blue!

197
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,700
The leader of a miniscule pirate band
with a 100 million-Berry bounty...

198
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,660
..."Straw Hat" Monkey D. Luffy!

199
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,920
Wow! The afroed Luffy is all
fired up in the right corner!

200
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,420
Lookin' sharp, Luffy!

201
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,550
Are you kidding me?

202
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,930
Luffy looks so cool!

203
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,180
He certainly does.

204
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,890
Both fighters have stepped onto the battlefield!

205
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,520
Can Straw Hat successfully
knock our boss out of the circle

206
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,110
and protect his crew and pride?!

207
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,030
Or will our boss's legendary undefeated
streak strip him of everything he has?!

208
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,030
This final and fateful combat
round of the Davy Back Fight

209
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,240
is about to begin!

210
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,990
But first, a word from our sponsors.

211
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,390
Hey, Straw Hat! Nice fashion!

212
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,650
Your butt is as good as kicked!

213
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,690
Keep your arms tucked in and
show 'im your golden right punch!

214
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,240
Yeah!

215
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,620
Whoa! His brotherly soul is burning red-hot!

216
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,120
Letting Usopp be his corner man was a mistake.

217
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
I wish he'd take this seriously...

218
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,250
Hey! Not too shabby!

219
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,500
What a wild style!

220
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,340
Quite admirable, even if you are my opponent!

221
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,930
I wouldn't act so confident
if I were you, Champion!

222
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,510
He's liable to bite your head off!
Better watch out!

223
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,770
All right, corner man! You're in the way! Scram!

224
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,520
Whoa! My job as corner man is over already?!

225
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,730
Corner man, out!

226
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,690
Get goin' already!

227
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,480
You're absolutely right!

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,610
There's no need for me to remain
here either! I'll leave as well!

229
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,830
What? The stands are...!

230
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,910
Oh, cool! I didn't know they did that!

231
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,340
Now then, Straw Hat Luffy.
Let's have some fun!

232
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,880
This entire ship is our battlefield!
Rampage to your heart's desire!

233
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,600
We have plenty of skilled shipwrights, you see!

234
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,190
By sheer luck, this bout is taking
place aboard the Sexy Foxy!

235
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,360
What kind of deadly struggle
is about to unfold?!

236
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
The two pirates are now all alone
inside the spacious battlefield!

237
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,320
--Boss!
--Keep your undefeated streak going!

238
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,240
Win, Luffy! You hafta win!

239
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,660
His beam! Watch out for his beam!

240
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,210
Excitement fills the stands!

241
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,380
It's plunder or be plundered!

242
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,300
500 people are on the line in this final
combat round of the Davy Back Fight!

243
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,220
It's one match only, with no time limit!

244
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,220
--Luffy!
--Boss!

245
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,970
Silver Fox Foxy versus Straw Hat Luffy!

246
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,390
It's a head-to-head battle between
these two pirate powerhouses!

247
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,770
The fate of everything hangs in the balance!

248
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,400
Here comes...

249
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,610
...the starting bell!

250
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,690
--Let's do it!
--Yeah!

251
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,450
--Gum-Gum... Pistol!
--Slow-Slow Beam!

252
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,290
Only my fist is slow!

253
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,880
You're not so tough! You're all show!

254
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,630
What?!

255
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,210
Come back!

256
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,220
Slow-Slow...

257
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,890
Oh, no!

258
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,060
Just kidding!

259
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,560
Wha...?!

260
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,930
Slow-Slow Beam!

261
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,270
Luffy!

262
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,690
He's floating! He's slow even when falling?

263
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,780
I told him to watch out for that!

264
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,580
Talk about lame!

265
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,160
Now beat 'im, Boss!

266
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,040
Aww... Crap...

267
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,840
What's the matter, Straw Hat?
Ready to throw in the towel already?!

268
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,640
Say...

269
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
...what...?

270
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,270
Nine-Tails Rush!

271
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,150
Oh! Our boss unleashes a
fierce attack right off the bat!

272
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,400
Straw Hat is helpless to do anything!

273
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,240
Huh? He isn't even budging...

274
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,660
No, that's not true!

275
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,700
The effects are slow too, that's all!

276
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,050
That was just a little "hello."

277
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,340
The punches themselves
didn't hurt you too much.

278
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,930
That much is obvious to me, rubber man!

279
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,470
Darn... it...

280
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,930
Well, your thirty seconds are about up!

281
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,770
--It's hitting him all at once!
--Oh, no! He's going overboard!

282
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,270
Luffy!

283
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,620
Crap! The Slow-Slow Beam is
more dangerous than I thought!

284
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,830
Beams sure are nice...

285
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,670
Guess I shouldn't stretch more than I need to...

286
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,960
Where'd that jerk go?!

287
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
Damn! I won't get hit by that anymore!

288
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,220
Come out, Split-Head!

289
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,060
Please don't take your anger out on the ears!

290
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,150
A-Another Slow-Slow?!

291
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,280
Welcome to my ship!

292
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,570
Why, you...!

293
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,780
He got me!

294
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,330
Calm down, will you?

295
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,170
I'm trying to show you some hospitality here...

296
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,170
Those cannonballs have been Slow-Slow-ed...

297
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,920
If you can ride one, then I can too!

298
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,670
Oh...! I wouldn't ride that one if I were you...

299
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,300
Oh, or that one.

300
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,940
Told you so!

301
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,150
What is this? What's going on in the fight?!

302
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,240
Hey! Robin!

303
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,620
Can you see anything from up there?

304
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,500
Nothing but smoke!

305
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Darn it...

306
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,510
Man, he's wrecking his own ship...

307
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,800
I'm just getting started!

308
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,220
Slow-Slow Foxy Face Bombs!

309
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,940
Freaky!

310
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,860
Huh? Pin badges? They're
bigger than the one I bought!

311
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,240
Of course we are! We're bombs!

312
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,530
You are?! Yikes!

313
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,080
Huh? A bomb just talked!

314
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,950
I'm... the real deal!

315
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,500
Sorry, Straw Hat...

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,750
...but I upgraded my gloves!

317
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,170
And the Face Bombs'
30 seconds are just about up!

318
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,890
Oh, yeah! Luffy! The body! The body!

319
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,560
Oh, Usopp!

320
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,060
Hey, what's happening with the fight?

321
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,230
Dunno. Beats me.

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,520
Are you serious?!

323
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,160
Luffy... Oh, no...!

324
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,270
A piece of a dream that we started grasping

325
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,820
Chasing after something constant

326
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,780
We send our aspirations sailing into the sky

327
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,700
Even when we're exhausted

328
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,870
We have a compass that can
search for something constant

329
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:43,290
Say, do you think we can keep it forever?

330
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,210
At the end of the dream
that we will reach someday

331
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,090
We want to be adults as we
are now as much as possible

332
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,970
We pray to this endless sky that we look up at

333
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,010
Eternally... Eternally...

334
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,850
Wild fantasies from our childhood

335
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,650
We trace unforgettable memories

336
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:06,360
And try to keep the embers
burning that still consume us

337
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,110
To this familiar sunny sky

338
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,990
Together we entrust our feelings

339
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,580
We go beyond the changing time

340
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,700
Eternally... Eternally...

341
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,760
Get up! Get up, Joe-- err, come on, Luffy!

342
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,630
--Do a No-Guard stance, then a double-cross!
--Who are you pretending to be?!

343
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,180
Now! Remember the eye of the tig--!

344
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,890
Not you too, Robin!

345
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,980
--Pops... I'm gonna be pure white ash...
--Don't burn up! Fight!

346
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,770
I'm having fun! Come on, Straw Hat!

347
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,980
On the next episode of One Piece!

348
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,650
"Full-Blast Slow-Slow Onslaught
vs. Invulnerable Luffy"

349
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,480
--I'm gonna be King of--
--Nope, I am!

350
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,690
Huh?!
