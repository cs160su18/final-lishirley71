00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Inherited will...

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,870
The tide of the times...
People's dreams...

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,380
These things cannot be stopped.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,480
As long as people seek
the answer of freedom,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
these things will never cease to be!

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,200
I only believe in the future--
I don't care if anyone laughs

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,540
That racing passion makes you shine

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It's too bright, but I want to gaze at it

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,150
I sense "aesthetics" somewhere

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm really, really stuck on you

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,990
I follow, follow in the footsteps
of a dream that resembles no one

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,330
Until I dramatically get it

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Believe In Wonderland!

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm going to catch, catch the shape
of a dream no one can see

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to go with you,
so passionate feelings

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,590
I don't really need
everything to add up

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,760
Rather than run-of-the-mill daily life,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
run for paradise instead

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
Believe In Wonderland!

21
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,210
Hm...? What's that?

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,260
Hey! There's a flock of birds to starboard!

23
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,520
Alrighty!

24
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,430
Gum-Gum...

25
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,320
...Grab!

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,850
Hold on a sec... Hey!

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,260
Hey, look.

28
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,950
It's a girl!

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,760
Ugh!

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,210
A wind is coming.

31
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,180
A strong wind is...

32
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,970
I feel like this ship hasn't
been moving at all for a while...

33
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,420
Ah!

34
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,270
Dammit...!
We've entered the Calm Belt!!

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,580
Charm Belt?

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,470
What the heck is that?

37
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,890
Calm Belt! It's an area of sea
where nothing moves a muscle!

38
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,030
"Nami grew her muscles"?

39
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,240
Idiot!

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,980
What was that? An earthquake?

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,810
Earthquake? On the sea?

42
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,200
You guys, enough chit chat!

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,220
Fold the sails and start paddling now!

44
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,460
Put the ship back on its earlier path!

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,130
Okay, Nami-san!

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,230
What're you panicking about?
Paddling? This is a sailboat.

47
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,560
He's right. Why're we taking
the trouble to go back

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,310
to where the Navy is waiting for us?

49
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,440
Just do what I say!
We're in big trouble!

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,270
Well, the sea is quiet.

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,890
Yeah.

52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,190
All right, fine! Then I'll
explain it for you! Listen up!

53
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,110
Since we rushed and ran away,
we came further south than we planned!

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,350
Then did we enter the Grand Line?

55
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,020
All right!

56
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,860
If it was that easy, anyone could enter!

57
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,390
Look. The Grand Line is
running between two sea areas!

58
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,130
Do you get it?

59
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,450
The area on both sides of
it is called the Calm Belt.

60
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,370
The reason is unknown but in these areas,
there's no wind and no current.

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,610
They're an area of sea with complete calm.

62
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,170
Sailboats run by catching winds,
so it's an extremely dangerous area,

63
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,100
indeed, a fatal area, for them!

64
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,640
Luffy, did you get it?

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,650
Yeah. At least that we're in trouble.

66
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,980
I see. Good, you got more than I thought.

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,980
So this is what the geezer meant
when he said it was dangerous...

68
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,830
No wonder there hasn't been any wind.

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,320
We can't do anything
if the ship doesn't move.

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
We can just wait until
the wind starts blowing.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,770
Like I said, once you're in
this area, wind never blows

72
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,180
no matter how long you wait!
And, that's not all!

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,600
There's another reason that
people call this area dangerous!

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,640
In this area...

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,320
Ah! Another one!

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
What's going on?

77
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,180
Something is coming this way.

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Here they are!!

79
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Huh...? What's that?

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,160
They're huge!!

81
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,310
The Calm Belt is the
nest of the Sea Kings.

82
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,170
Moreover, the ones here are super huge!

83
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,390
They're another reason why
people can't cross the Calm Belt.

84
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,360
"Miraculous Creature! Apis's Secret
and the Legendary Island"

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,000
What're we gonna do now?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
F-For the time being, no one move.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,330
They'll probably go back
into the sea eventually.

88
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,670
Then we'll paddle hard using our oars.

89
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,340
Are you serious?!

90
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,240
Idiot!

91
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,860
Sorry.

92
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,240
A frog is coming!!

93
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,380
What?! What?! What?!

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,710
Oh, no!

95
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,510
Y-Your arm is stretching!!

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,760
Luffy! Do you have
the power of a devil fruit?!

97
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,190
Yeah, that's right.

98
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
Luffy!

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
Stretch your arm downwards again!

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
Hey, Luffy!

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
What're you doing?!

102
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,910
I don't know.

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,660
Apis!

104
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,620
Watch out!!

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,830
One, two...

106
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,160
What did she just do?!

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,100
She pulled his nose hair.

108
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,010
Hold on a sec...!

109
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,670
If you do that...

110
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,150
He's gonna sneeze!

111
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,660
Ahh...

112
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,780
That's a huge nose hair!

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,870
All right! We're going back!

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,460
What?!

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,370
Do it some other way!!

116
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,630
Amazing! I feel like we're flying!

117
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,330
Idiot!!

118
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,070
We are flying!!

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,650
Looks like we're back
in the area we came from.

120
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,370
I don't see any sign of the Navy, either.

121
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,600
Ahhh... I thought I was a goner.

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,460
Good job!

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,320
Yep!

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,860
Okay! Unfurl the sails!

125
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,190
Our destination is...

126
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,900
Of course...!

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,370
Warship Island!!

128
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,330
We can't see anything.

129
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,660
Well, we can see the fog.

130
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,860
Apis, is it really around here?

131
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,680
Not sure.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,670
"Not sure"? You...

133
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,340
It should be close by.

134
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,110
That's our Nami-san!

135
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,090
You sure know your stuff.

136
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,280
Ah...! Look!

137
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,810
Huh?

138
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,470
Oh! It's a sailboat! It's huge!

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,750
Now listen here...

140
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,160
The word "huge" doesn't
begin to describe it.

141
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,290
Then, a super humongous sailboat?

142
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,720
No!

143
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,960
That's Warship Island.

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
It's shaped like a warship,
so it's called Warship Island.

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,260
I see! Interesting!

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,580
Ah! That flag is...!

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,830
Pirates!

148
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,470
Pirates!! Pirates have come!!

149
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,620
Pirates?

150
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,910
Stay inside!

151
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,280
Hi! I'm home!

152
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,060
Apis...!

153
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,780
Why are you coming out
from the pirate ship?

154
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,440
What's going on?

155
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,790
Say, you guys...

156
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,940
Wh-What?!

157
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,740
Is there a BBQ restaurant on this island?!

158
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,060
Huh?

159
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,840
Wh-What's this guy?

160
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,550
Listen! They're pirates,
but they're good ones.

161
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,460
Are there really good pirates?

162
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,270
Yes!

163
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,230
Weren't you taken away by
the Navy in the first place?

164
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,310
That's right. But I escaped.

165
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,750
And these guys, Luffy and
the others, saved me. Right?

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,470
Yeah.

167
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,310
What'd you do, Apis?

168
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,320
We don't know why, but the
Navy was looking for you.

169
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,570
You should stay away from your home.

170
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,490
They're still around.

171
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,990
What am I gonna do?

172
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,080
We'd like to help, but...

173
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,330
...they're pirates, right?

174
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,480
Ahh, what should we do?

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,670
Like she said, we're good pirates.

176
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,570
Apis!

177
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,390
Come to my house!

178
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,200
Who's that?

179
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Don't know.

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,790
Grandpa Bokuden!

181
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,020
I'm glad you're safe.

182
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,280
Thank you for saving Apis.

183
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,100
How about this? I'd like to throw
a small welcome party for you.

184
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,570
Is your place a BBQ restaurant?

185
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,520
It's not a BBQ restaurant,

186
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,090
but Grandpa Bokuden's pork buns
are the best on the island!

187
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,880
All right! Let's go!

188
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,550
Well then, we'll go.

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,010
Hm?!

190
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,040
There she is!

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,980
Eric!

192
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,670
I've been here all along...

193
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,370
I thought that that girl
got lost in the Calm Belt

194
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,920
and wasn't going to come back alive!

195
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,740
Can't be... That girl...?

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,480
She's...

197
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,520
...back on Warship Island!
Capture that girl, you bum!

198
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,750
Then they escaped from the Calm Belt...!

199
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,450
There,

200
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,930
the preparations are finished.
Wait a little while.

201
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,160
Cool!

202
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,660
Whoa! Smells good!

203
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,460
I see... This is the real deal.

204
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,670
Old man, how long do we have to wait?

205
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,240
Hm? Well...

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,070
maybe about 4-5 hours...

207
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,890
What?!

208
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,230
Ah, I'm starving.

209
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,290
Bokuden-san,

210
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,350
why is the Navy after Apis?
Do you have any idea?

211
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,920
Apis! Do you have any idea?

212
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,020
Not at all!

213
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,690
You said there was a reason
but you didn't want to tell.

214
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,260
Oh that! I lied.

215
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,100
What?

216
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,690
Then none at all.

217
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,910
None at all?!

218
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,330
Really, there's nothing on this island.
Nothing but an old legend.

219
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,640
Legend?

220
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,240
The residents of this island are said
to be descendants of Lost Island people

221
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,460
who prospered but sank into the sea
tens of thousands of years ago.

222
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,490
On Lost Island, there lived
dragons called Millennial Dragons.

223
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,770
The bones of those dragons
are called Dragonite...

224
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,150
...and it's said to be
an elixir of immortality.

225
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,320
I see...

226
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,020
But a legend like that is no reason
for the Navy to get involved.

227
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah. Why is the Navy doing
this in the first place?

228
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,100
That's the thing I don't get.

229
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,410
Doesn't this legend hold some
sort of clue or something?

230
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,710
To begin with, the first king

231
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,940
of Lost Island was Iscardunk.

232
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,290
Here we go again...

233
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,010
Now, King PokePortes had three children.

234
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,680
The oldest son was BokeHontas,
the second son was BokeBonboko, and

235
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,770
the third son was BokeBokepon.

236
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,770
Shhh!

237
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,310
One day, the king said to these three,

238
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,680
"Listen. Go find the tree that grows stars,
which is said to be in dragon's valley.

239
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,830
So BokeHontas,
BokeBonboko and BokeBokepon

240
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,540
journeyed out, one to the sea,

241
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,970
Once Grandpa starts that story,

242
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,570
one to the mountain and one to the forest.

243
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,230
it'll take forever.

244
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,570
I'm not gonna listen to all that.

245
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,300
Now, the 317th King IngriMongri III's son

246
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,420
Hey, how long is this gonna go on?

247
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,660
IngriGrimori was quite a wise ruler.

248
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,660
Who knows.

249
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,580
He had 18 children. His 18 children...

250
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,980
...He was a king who

251
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,850
carried out major reforms.

252
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,550
This King Ikemenes had so many children.

253
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,570
Ahhh, I'm starving...

254
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,390
We won't be able to eat

255
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,550
until this story is over, will we?

256
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,090
He had many princes. 65 of them!

257
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,090
the pork buns until then?

258
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,250
Pork buns?

259
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,680
I hear it was like, "If you throw a stone,

260
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,380
Luffy?

261
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,180
it'll hit one of the princes."

262
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,420
I gotta take a leak.

263
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Pork buns...

264
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,710
Hold on, Grandpa Ryu.

265
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,760
Oh, no!

266
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,920
He's coming this way!
What am I gonna do?

267
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,380
Please! Don't come here!

268
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,660
Pork buns smell yummy.

269
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,810
No way!

270
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,850
I didn't hit him yet, right?

271
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,810
Ahhh, pork buns...

272
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,610
And, the 1,111th... no,

273
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,320
the 1,121st King was HokeHontas.

274
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,150
So, NemeNememitas

275
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,480
Hey, where're you going?

276
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,760
thought about what he could do

277
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,840
I'm worried about Luffy.

278
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,920
since he's gone for a long time.

279
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,980
to protect this kingdom.

280
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,950
So I'll go check.

281
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,800
Then, he made preparation

282
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,330
That's not fair.

283
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,920
before large countries attacked them.

284
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,920
Nami-san's lovely
even when she sneaks out.

285
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,870
Phew! Good grief!

286
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,800
Luffy!

287
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,670
Ahhh! Not even one bun is left!

288
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,510
Yeah, this is yummy.

289
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,680
Yummy?! How do you intend to make
up for eating everyone's share?!

290
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,010
What're you talking about?

291
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,090
Geez... Hm?

292
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,840
What's this?

293
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,240
What made this trail?

294
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,310
Hm? Dead end?

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,580
What's the deal?

296
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,270
Hm?

297
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,470
Hey, Luffy, what're you doing?

298
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,140
A hole.

299
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,930
What?

300
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,830
Looks like they went across here.

301
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,000
Luffy!

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,770
Yep! Gum-Gum...

303
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,480
Suspension Bridge...

304
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,700
Grandpa Ryu!

305
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,560
This is the other side of the mountain.

306
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,720
How far did they go?

307
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,490
Ah, that's...

308
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,060
Yes, I was fine.
These weird pirates saved me.

309
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,970
No, they're not that scary.

310
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,660
You must be hungry. I brought
Grandpa Bokuden's pork buns.

311
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,610
Here you go. No! Slow down!

312
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh, I'm sorry. I still don't know yet.

313
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,860
Although I'm searching very hard,
I still haven't found a clue yet.

314
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,830
I wonder who on earth Apis is talking to.

315
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,940
Hey, Apis! Who're you talking to?

316
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,290
Don't just jump out and say "hey"!

317
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,760
No! Don't come here!

318
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,690
Whoa!!

319
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,810
Luffy, what's the matter?

320
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,930
Ahh!!

321
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,030
Stop it! I said stop it!

322
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,030
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

323
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,490
Hey, Luffy...

324
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,130
This is the real thing! Is he alive?

325
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,350
Stop it! Leave him alone!

326
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,630
I can't believe... that it really exists...

327
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,470
I thought that dragons were just legends!

328
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,510
This is incredible!
Where did you come from?

329
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,290
I see... You want to go home, huh?

330
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,550
Okay...

331
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,660
Grandpa Ryu says that you
can be his friend, Luffy.

332
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,410
He says he can tell
you're a good person.

333
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,670
Luffy, how could you
read Grandpa Ryu's mind?

334
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,970
I somehow did.

335
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,100
Somehow...?

336
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,610
How did you know?

337
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh, well, I...

338
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,800
Could it be... a devil fruit...?

339
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,430
You have the power of
a devil fruit, don't you?

340
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,620
Yes. I ate one called
Whisper-Whisper Fruit or something.

341
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,900
Since then, I've become
able to read animals' minds.

342
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,300
That's why you knew
a wind was coming that time.

343
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,630
Yep. The seabirds told me that.

344
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,020
I met Grandpa Ryu thanks to
the Whisper-Whisper Fruit, too.

345
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,070
Who is it?

346
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,180
I've never heard such
a sad voice before...

347
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,830
Hold on! I'm coming to help you now!

348
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,270
Was it you who called me?

349
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,750
He had lost his energy.

350
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,020
He said that he got separated
from his friends and

351
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,750
that since then he had
been looking for Lost Island,

352
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,290
where the dragons' nest is.

353
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,590
Didn't Lost Island sink
a long long time ago?

354
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,370
Grandpa Ryu says that the
island will surface again.

355
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,300
He says it's about time,

356
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,760
but he no longer clearly
remembers where it is.

357
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,040
He's gotten very old
and lost the energy to fly.

358
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,380
But he keeps telling me
that he wants to go back.

359
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,230
I wanna help, but I can't figure out
where such an island exists at all...

360
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,990
The legend by itself
doesn't really give me a clue...

361
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,700
So I asked the Navy who happened
to stop by this island about it.

362
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,330
That was a mistake.
They were looking for Dragonite.

363
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,670
Dragonite... you mean
the one for immortality?

364
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,830
They took you away
because of such a thing?

365
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,010
Yes. They told me to tell them
everything I knew and took me away.

366
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,510
The pendant that I made with a claw

367
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,350
Grandpa Ryu gave me may
have been another reason, though...

368
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,410
That's why you escaped in that storm...

369
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,800
--You are too reckless!
--I know.

370
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,490
--You are too reckless!
--I know.

371
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,250
That's why I keep this a secret to
the villagers and even to Bokuden-san.

372
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,200
I don't want to cause troubles for them.

373
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,370
But I want to take Grandpa Ryu back
to his home no matter what it takes.

374
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,360
He always tells me that he'll
get his energy back for sure

375
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
once he goes back to the dragons' nest.

376
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,620
I'll find it for him no matter
how many years it takes.

377
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,400
For sure... No matter what it takes,
I'll find it for him.

378
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,470
Okay then! I'll take him there!

379
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,810
Luffy! Were you listening?!
Lost Island sank into the sea!

380
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,820
But since the legendary
Millennial Dragon actually exists,

381
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,560
I'm sure Lost Island
also exists somewhere!

382
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,900
An island that's not even on a map?

383
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,870
Yeah, that's why we're going!

384
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,660
An island that's not even on a map, huh?

385
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,310
Oh, what the heck? Let's go!

386
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,400
All right!

387
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,630
Really?! Really?!

388
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,150
Yeah.

389
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,170
Thank you!

390
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,290
Now that that's been decided, eat more!

391
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,710
Oh, Luffy, I forgot to tell you...

392
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,620
Grandpa Ryu is a little senile.

393
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,020
That girl had a pendant with
a Millennial Dragon's claw.

394
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,800
She must know about Lost Island.

395
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,770
That darn girl who knows
the secret of the Dragonite...

396
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,840
I'll definitely capture her this time!

397
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
My overflowing feelings don't connect

398
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,980
as I firmly squeeze your hand back

399
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll set off by myself,

400
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,250
so keep watching me intently
as I go into the distance

401
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I was thinking about it
a bit since this morning

402
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,330
Why is it so hot?

403
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:55,740
Starting from some point, I haven't
been able to get away from that

404
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to catch those
feelings that rushed off,

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,560
and I'm already about
to overtake myself, even

406
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I want to embrace my
dreams that have jumped out

407
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,730
With you, I can run there

408
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,310
Taking the Millennial Dragon
back to his home?

409
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,650
Why'd you promise such
a thing without asking us?

410
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,550
Hey, let's go to Lost Island!

411
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,320
Hey, the Navy is following us!

412
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,820
Everyone, please help us!

413
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Let's go, Nami-san!

414
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,650
A runaway journey of love
beyond the ocean! Mellorine love.

415
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,820
Are you stupid?

416
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,990
What'd you say?!

417
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,320
On the next episode on One Piece!

418
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,330
"Eric Attacks! Great Escape
from Warship Island!"

419
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,820
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
