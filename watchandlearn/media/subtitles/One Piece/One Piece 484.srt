2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,030
Separated from the rest of the Straw Hats,

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,100
Luffy made it to Marineford to rescue
his brother, Ace who was to be executed!

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,600
In the midst of the Navy's onslaught,
Luffy finally freed Ace! However,

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,870
Admiral Akainu landed a
fatal blow against Ace!

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,760
Pops!

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,510
Everybody!

65
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,400
And you Luffy.

66
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,180
Thank you...

67
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,640
...for loving someone like
me who is good for nothing...

68
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,600
...and who has such bad blood in his veins...

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
...up to today.

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,580
Thank you!

71
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,650
"The Navy Headquarters Falls!
Whitebeard's Unspeakable Wrath!"

72
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,530
Ace...

73
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,650
Did you think that I was dead?

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,460
But...!

75
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,600
Why are you crying?! I'm not dead, fool!

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,780
I promise that I'll never die!

77
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,020
How can I leave a wimpy
brother like you behind?

78
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,570
Garp!

79
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,080
Look after my child!

80
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,500
His name is Gol D. Ace.

81
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,760
Did you know? We can become brothers
if we exchange this cup of sake!

82
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,260
From now on,

83
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,720
we're brothers!

84
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,300
You got to be kidding me!

85
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,110
Ace...!

86
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,110
Ace!

87
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,120
Ace!!

88
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,460
"Fire Fist" Ace is dead!

89
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,100
Straw boy!

90
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,030
He's losing it!

91
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,200
His life is in danger!

92
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,380
It's Akainu!

93
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,720
I'll get you this time for sure!

94
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,820
Straw Hat!

95
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,570
I'm not gonna let you kill him!

96
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,620
Luffy-kun! Luffy-kun! Stay with me!

97
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,200
Move out of my way!

98
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,500
The war is not over yet!

99
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,760
Take Ace's brother with you, Jimbei!

100
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,340
All right!

101
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,140
Straw Hat's life is how
Ace's life will live on!

102
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,400
Commander... Marco!

103
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,830
We will protect him at any
cost on Ace's behalf!

104
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,960
If we let him die,

105
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,200
it's a dishonor to the Whitebeard Pirates!

106
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,840
Luffy-kun, don't lose your sanity!

107
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,710
I told you that I won't
let the brothers get away!

108
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,190
Straw Hat!

109
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,770
Akainu-san!

110
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,000
Pops is furious!

111
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
Guys, we gotta get out of here!

112
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,840
Hell Hound!

113
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,020
Pops!

114
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,130
You must resign!

115
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,010
Pops!!

116
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,950
Pops!

117
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,500
Pops!

118
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,010
Pops.

119
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
Pops.

120
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,280
Pops!

121
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,060
Navy HQ is collapsing!

122
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,920
You bastard!

123
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,840
Whitebeard!

124
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,180
Admiral Sakazuki!

125
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,110
--Don't fall!
--Hang on!

126
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,720
Is it over?

127
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,880
How's Pops?!

128
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,810
Pops!

129
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,410
The plaza has split in two! The
pirates are on the other side!

130
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,580
We are completely separated from Pops!

131
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Pops!

132
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,280
Pops!

133
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,440
He still got this much power
after his torso has been charred?

134
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,240
You haven't seen anything yet.

135
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,470
From now on,

136
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm the only one who you have to deal with!

137
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
Bring it on!

138
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,000
Everybody, get on the ship!

139
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,360
Pops!

140
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,430
Think about why Pops stayed on that
side and the wish that he left for us!

141
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,930
Cry after you get on the ship!

142
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,730
--Pops! Ace!
--Hurry up!

143
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,110
Bring all able ships alongside the bay head!

144
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,560
We won't let you get away!

145
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,740
Hurry up, everyone!

146
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,320
Salome! I can't stop worrying about Luffy!

147
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,590
Forgive me for disobeying you
and staying back to watch, Pops.

148
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,100
Hey, look! What is that?!

149
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,900
There is something behind the HQ building!

150
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,570
Oh, they found me!

151
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,320
Not only him! Who are they on the scaffold?

152
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,030
Oh... They noticed us finally.

153
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,620
It's you! How did you all get here?!

154
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,960
Why are they here?!

155
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,670
You bastard.

156
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,390
They're the most heinous criminals

157
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,640
whose existence has been erased
because of their brutality!

158
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
He's the biggest of all living things!

159
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
A Pirate--"Great Battleship" San Juan Wolf!

160
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,940
"GREAT BATTLESHIP" SAN JUAN WOLF

161
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,940
Oh, not only am I found
but they know who I am!

162
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,690
"Corrupt King" Avalo Pizarro!

163
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,660
"CORRUPT KING" AVALO PIZARRO

164
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,660
I missed being back on the street!

165
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,490
"Heavy Drinker" Vasco Shot!

166
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,050
"HEAVY DRINKER" VASCO SHOT

167
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,130
Am I allowed to kill them all?

168
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,590
"Crescent Moon Hunter" Catarina Devon!

169
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:52,600
"CRESCENT MOON HUNTER" CATARINA DEVON

170
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,600
Can't believe how much you guys want it.

171
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,860
And the Jail Manager of Impel Down

172
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,560
SHIRYU OF THE RAIN

173
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,560
Shiryu of the Rain!

174
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,480
They're the Blackbeard Pirates!

175
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,280
Long time no see! I'm glad that
I'm present at your death!

176
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,990
Pops!

177
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,950
Teach...!

178
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,840
It all started with this man.

179
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,050
Blackbeard, driven by his hidden
ambition, attacks Whitebeard.

180
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,010
Whitebeard fights back,
intent on avenging Thatch.

181
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,480
The fated battle begins at last!

182
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,900
On the next episode of One Piece!

183
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,210
"Ending the Matter! Whitebeard
vs. The Blackbeard Pirates!"

184
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
