2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,770
Travel across the oceans of the world

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,070
Bellow a battle cry

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,510
We've left the established course

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,520
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,740
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,750
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,080
Travel across the oceans of the world

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,340
Bellow a battle cry

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,280
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,980
"That feeling" I get when embarking

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,230
Is something I hope to remember always

15
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,780
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

16
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,990
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,040
Shy hearts engrave
the rhythm of adventure

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,530
Snatch up the treasure here and there

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,740
While laughing out loud

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,080
As we dash by like a noisy party

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
Make some waves...

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,870
Life is "Adventurous"

23
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,620
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,190
Who's gonna be "One of us"

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,850
And a trip goes on because

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,470
We da pirate of the "Mass"

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
To the West, To the East

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Gotta find my way, Sail away

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
All the way to "One piece"!!

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,200
And spread your wings

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,650
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's press forward

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,540
While laughing out loud

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,510
As we dash by like a noisy party

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,670
Make some waves...

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,680
Wait, PX-1.

39
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,250
This one's...

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,090
...the real deal!

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,390
If you were to take a trip,
where would you want to go?

42
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,670
Come on, Zoro!

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,990
We gotta get outta here, quick!

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,980
Zoro-san...?

45
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,570
What happened...?!

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Zoro...

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,220
disappeared!

48
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,360
"Eliminated Friends --
The Final Day of the Straw Hat Crew"

49
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,360
Z-Zoro...?!

50
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,340
You!

51
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,590
What the hell did you do to Zoro?!

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,530
He was...!

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,410
He was right here just now!

54
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,550
Zoro...

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,210
Zoro...

56
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,860
Zoro...

57
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,870
Zoro...

58
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,670
Zoro!

59
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,840
Stop, Chopper!

60
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,740
Don't do anything crazy!

61
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Zoro! Where did you go?!

62
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,580
He's attacking at random...

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,950
But more importantly,

64
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,190
what is that bastard Kuma-kou doing here?

65
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,460
Bartholomew Kuma...

66
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,130
This is exactly why pirates can't be trusted!

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
I'd like to cover for them, but...

68
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,870
Zoro... was erased!

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,250
Does this mean the real one's
finally showed up?!

70
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,900
No question about it!

71
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,510
I've seen that power before!

72
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,750
A girl on Thriller Bark was erased
like that and never came back...

73
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,580
That can't be good...

74
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,600
Hey! What did he do to Zoro?!

75
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,470
Where did he send him?!

76
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,010
I don't have to answer you!

77
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,350
I'm the world's most tight-lipped man!

78
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,900
I don't know if it's true or not,
but they say that his paw pads

79
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,490
can send a person flying through the
sky for three days and three nights!

80
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,480
Only he knows where he sent him.

81
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,450
At the very least, he's not on these islands

82
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,500
or anywhere easily accessible.

83
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,370
Could even be on the other side of the world.

84
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,080
What?!

85
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,330
Say something, damn it!

86
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,220
Where did you send Zoro?!

87
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,010
So you finally show yourself,
real Warlord of the Sea...

88
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
You're the third to look like that...

89
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,030
What's the deal?!

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,540
R-R-Real Warlord of the Sea...?

91
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,400
S-Stay away!

92
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,710
Stop, damn it!

93
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Stay away! Stop!

94
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,540
I-I have 8,000 men under
my command, you know!

95
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,430
Hey! Are you listening?! Stay away!

96
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,930
Look out, Usopp! Behind you!

97
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,430
Behind--?

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,510
Usopp-san!

99
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,110
Stay out of the way.

100
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,580
He erased his own ally?

101
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,260
He even attacked PX-1?!

102
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,420
What are you doing to your allies, Kuma-kou?!

103
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,800
Run! All three of you!

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,310
Luffy?!

105
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,480
Just get out of here!

106
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,400
You can think things over after you're safe!

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,700
Go!

108
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,170
Come on! Let's go!

109
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,590
But, Zoro...!

110
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,620
He told us to think about stuff later!

111
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,760
Come on!

112
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,010
Let's go! The beam only grazed me!
I'll lend you a shoulder! Hurry!

113
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,260
Look out, you two!

114
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,330
Brook!

115
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,710
Brook!

116
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,060
I will protect you,
even if it costs me my life!

117
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,070
Oh, wait, I'm already d--

118
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,930
Brook!

119
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,160
Bastard did it again!

120
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,950
Damn! What am I doing?!

121
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,370
I just let two friends
disappear while I watched on!

122
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,920
Damn it!

123
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,390
Sanji?!

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,980
Go, Usopp!

125
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't be stupid! You're coming too, Sanji!

126
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,330
Why, you...!

127
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
Stop! Sanji!

128
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,630
Damn you, you pawed bastard!

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,680
Sanji!

130
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,910
S-Stay away...

131
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,980
Stay away!

132
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,560
Stay away! Stay away!

133
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,090
Flame Star! Flame Star!

134
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,330
Dammit! Flame Star! Flame Star!

135
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,260
Flame Star! Flame Star!

136
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,310
Usopp!

137
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,380
Run! Run!

138
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,440
Usopp!

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Sanji!

140
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,890
Damn you!

141
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,120
Stop! Sanji!

142
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,840
Even Sanji...

143
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,760
What is this? What do we do...?

144
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,220
This can't be... They're all...

145
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,500
Sounds like the situation
over there isn't normal!

146
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,930
I wish I could lend them a hand...

147
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,410
What a pain growing old is!

148
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,200
If fending off a navy admiral
still isn't enough to satisfy you,

149
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
then that leaves me in an awkward position.

150
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,120
Just give it up, already!

151
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,580
Dark King Rayleigh, yes?

152
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,800
Kuma...

153
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,990
Luffy!

154
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,410
You want me to trust you?

155
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
That choice is yours.

156
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,780
I fear for my own situation as well.

157
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,550
What do you think you're doing, Kuma?

158
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,030
We have no obligation
to act friendly with the navy

159
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,390
in matters that do not have
the government's backing.

160
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,930
I will not answer your question.

161
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,060
Why, you...!

162
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,900
Second Gear!

163
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,390
Luffy!

164
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,650
Let's go!

165
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,980
Outta the damn way!

166
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,780
Strong Right!

167
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,760
What?!

168
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,910
Wait! Don't, Luffy!

169
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,800
Gum-Gum Jet Pistol!

170
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,110
Luffy!

171
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,670
No!

172
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,280
Luffy... Help m--

173
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,410
Nami!

174
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,540
Luffy... Help m--

175
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,020
Luffy!

176
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,410
Chopper...

177
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,080
Chopper!

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,160
Chopper...

179
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,280
Stop... Stop... Stop...

180
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,890
Stop... Stop...

181
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,510
Stop it! That's enough!

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,900
Robin!

183
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,640
Luffy!

184
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,790
What is this? What is this?!

185
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,470
I'm...!

186
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,080
Never mind that!

187
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,420
Join my crew!

188
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,750
I'm so glad I'm alive!

189
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,010
Come out, Straw Hat!

190
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,110
Alright! Get on, Franky!

191
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,110
Get on my ship!

192
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,130
Fine! I'll take care of ya!

193
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,830
I, Franky, accept the job
of your ship's shipwright!

194
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,700
Why do you keep coming to save me?!

195
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,390
I just want to die!

196
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,520
I still haven't heard it from your mouth!

197
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,120
Say you want to live!

198
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,040
I want to live!

199
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,420
Even if I don't have
friends, I can still fight!

200
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,270
As long as the doctor's flag exists...!

201
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,810
You do have friends!

202
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,610
I'm your friend!

203
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,330
I'll stay here, but...

204
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,080
One day, if you feel like it, stop by agai--

205
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,690
Shut up! Let's go!

206
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,130
What do you want?
You don't even know anything..

207
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,950
This has nothing to do with you.

208
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,340
I told you, leave the damn island already!

209
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,100
Luffy...

210
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,140
Help me...

211
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,590
Nami!

212
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,430
You're my friend!

213
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,180
Wait!

214
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,680
We both have foolish dreams.

215
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,110
I'll be the cook for your ship.

216
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,330
Thank you for all the damn things
you've done for me all these years!

217
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,450
What're you talkin' about? Get on already.

218
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,540
We're friends now, aren't we?

219
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,540
Gum-Gum...

220
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,830
...Bullet!

221
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,340
You idiot...

222
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,600
You know you can't beat me!

223
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Please let me join your crew again!

224
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,280
You idiot! Just grab on already!

225
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,650
Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame...

226
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,000
I... I will not be defeated ever again!

227
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,530
Got any problems with that...

228
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,780
...King of the Pirates?!

229
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,750
Zoro...

230
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,210
Usopp...

231
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,710
Sanji...

232
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,180
Nami...

233
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,630
Chopper...

234
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,100
Robin...

235
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,550
Franky...

236
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,060
Brook...

237
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,920
Everyone...

238
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,980
I couldn't save even one of my friends...!

239
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,000
So, you're going to
send him off and that's it?

240
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,480
I hope you have a
good explanation for this...

241
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,400
This will be a major issue, you know...

242
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,760
We will never meet again.

243
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,000
Farewell...

244
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,540
Grove #12 of the Sabaody
Archipelago on the Grand Line...

245
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,800
On this day, the Straw Hat pirate crew
led by Captain Monkey D. Luffy...

246
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,830
suffered a complete collapse...

247
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,050
Next time, we'll be having
a period drama specials!

248
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,160
This time, we'll be holding
the once every 100 years,

249
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,370
Great Portable Shrine Race, with
a sacred treasure as the prize.

250
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,230
I'll have to make an appearance as well!

251
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,540
Sacred treasure, eh? Sounds yummy.

252
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,910
You're gonna eat it?!

253
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,350
On the next episode of One Piece!

254
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,020
"Feudal Era Side Story –
Boss Luffy Appears Again"

255
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm gonna be a detective!
