2
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
Wealth, fame, power...

3
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,810
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

4
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,400
once attained everything
this world has to offer.

5
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,320
The words he uttered
just before his death

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,870
drove people around
the world to the seas.

7
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,200
My treasure?

8
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,470
If you want it, you can have it!

9
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,820
Find it!

10
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,870
I left everything
this world has to offer there!

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,840
And so men rushed onto the
Grand Line in pursuit of romanticism!

12
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,060
The world has truly entered
a Great Pirate Era!

13
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,320
As Luffy and his friends continued their
voyage in search of Fishman Island,

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,710
they finally reached the Red Line,
the halfway point of the Grand Line.

15
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,230
It's the Red Line!

16
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,860
I can't see the top...

17
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,580
It's huge!

18
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,290
So this is the Red Line...

19
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,700
Anyway, we're halfway there now!

20
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,130
But the towering Red Line blocked their way,

21
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,620
and they lost their path to Fishman Island.

22
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,420
I know which way we need to go, but
I don't know the means to get there.

23
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,840
Gum-Gum Rifle!

24
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,010
It spit something out.

25
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,060
Huh? A fish?

26
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,360
It... It couldn't be!

27
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,290
Stuck at a dead end with no options,

28
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,790
Luffy and his friends met Camie the
mermaid and Pappug the starfish.

29
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,240
"Hatred for the Straw Hats!
Iron Mask Duval Appears!"

30
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,480
Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

31
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,930
Sure...

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,250
That surprised me! Look at all the humans!

33
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,630
Wh-What?

34
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,150
We're the one who're surprised!

35
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,090
Thanks for saving me when
I was about to be digested.

36
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,410
I'm such an easy target
for sea monsters to eat...

37
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,850
That was about the twentieth time.

38
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,660
You get eaten too much!

39
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,020
I need to do something to thank you.

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,750
I know! Would you like some takoyaki?

41
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,210
Takoyaki?! That's my favorite!

42
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,510
Really? Okay, that'll be
500 Berries per person!

43
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,880
What?!

44
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,050
You're trying to sell 'em?!

45
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,180
I messed up!

46
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,790
Mermaid! Mermaid!

47
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,980
Yes! The most admired of
all races, the mermaid!

48
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,820
The jewel of the sea, the mermaid!

49
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,340
And yes! I got to meet one of them!

50
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,060
She's so cute!

51
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,840
It's my first time meeting a mermaid!

52
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,140
You're name's Camie-chan?!

53
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,660
It's not your first time.

54
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,280
You met the old woman Kokoro, didn't you?

55
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,340
Thriller Bark?

56
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,700
No, that doesn't scare
me. It doesn't scare me!

57
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,600
If you want to know what scared
me the most in my life, it was...

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,820
Uh, sorry, Sanji! Pretend I didn't say that!

59
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,520
It's your first time seeing a mermaid!

60
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,640
You guys are rude!

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,570
Huh? The old woman Kokoro was a mermaid?

62
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,340
But she was walking.

63
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,590
Oh, that's right, you didn't know.

64
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,530
It was while you were fighting Lucci.

65
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,570
Don't you...

66
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,120
...die!

67
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,740
I really don't want to think
of Kokoro as a mermaid.

68
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,660
You're too blunt!

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,910
That hurt! What'd you do that for, Nami?!

70
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,980
I swear, when it comes to guys and
their desires toward mermaids...

71
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,750
She is quite a cute mermaid, though.

72
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,530
This is my first time
meeting a mermaid, as well.

73
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,930
Pardon me, but would you lend me some money?

74
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,930
Why should she?!

75
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,940
A skeleton!

76
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,110
Look at that! How could
you scare her?! Go away!

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,690
I can open my head, too. Fun, right?

78
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,070
Damn little...

79
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,580
How fun!

80
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,360
She's quick to accept people...

81
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,450
By the way, do you poop?

82
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,970
What are you asking her?!

83
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,720
Sure, I—

84
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
She does not!

85
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,810
She really doesn't!

86
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,810
Camie, Camie?

87
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,600
That's strange. Aren't you missing someone?

88
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,520
What's missing from that
little circle of fun?

89
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
The answer is me.

90
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,230
Oh, yeah, I've been wondering.

91
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,640
Hey, Camie, what's this talking glove thing?

92
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,800
Sorry, I totally forgot.

93
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,990
That's my pet, Pappug. He's
a starfish, and my master.

94
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,140
Master?

95
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,810
Yep. My master.

96
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,160
This thing?

97
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,920
Yep!

98
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,990
Nice to meet ya!

99
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,710
Do starfish talk?

100
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,050
Isn't it weird to have a
pet that's your master?

101
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,480
I let her keep me as a
pet. I've got my reasons.

102
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,820
Camie always gives me clams...

103
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,090
Food, eh?

104
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,970
"Are you a person?" I'm
a starfish, not a person.

105
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,170
What a brute!

106
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,570
I'm not a person, I'm a starfish.

107
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,840
"Are you busy?"

108
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,320
No, no!

109
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:42,200
I've got plenty of hands.

110
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,080
Yay! Thank you!

111
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,490
Laugh! This is where you laugh!

112
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,860
So, this T-shirt is by
a brand called Criminal.

113
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,390
It's all the rage on Fishman Island.

114
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,590
Wow!

115
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,870
It's so cool!

116
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,050
Pappug is the designer.

117
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,390
I want to be a designer someday, too.

118
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,500
You could totally be one, Camie-chan!

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,110
Thank you, Sanji-chin!

120
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,820
Nobody's listening...

121
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,240
Hey, how can you talk, anyway?

122
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,880
That's a very good question!

123
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,180
He got over that quick.

124
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,350
When I was little, I mistakenly
thought I was a person.

125
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,010
By the time I realized I was a starfish,
I could already speak human language.

126
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,420
You can learn to talk because of that?

127
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,480
It's scary when you get on a roll!

128
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,850
That momentum drives the world!

129
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,770
So anyway, I'm Pappug the starfish.

130
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm an up-and-coming designer.

131
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,020
Thanks for saving us!

132
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,270
I'm glad we met you, actually.

133
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,420
We had just lost our way,
and I wanted to ask—

134
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,430
Hey, Nami! Takoyaki comes first!

135
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,280
Oh, right. I wanted to
repay you with takoyaki.

136
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,360
Then we'll have to meet up
with Hatchin somewhere...

137
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,430
Hatchin?

138
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,540
Ring ring ring... Ring ring ring...

139
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,580
Ring ring ring... Click.

140
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,650
Hello, Hatchin? It's Camie!

141
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,810
Sorry we got separated. Where are you now?

142
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,880
Hey! Is that Camie I hear?

143
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,340
Hatchin?

144
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,890
You don't know who I am? I'm not Hachi.

145
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,810
What?! You're not Hatchin?!

146
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,310
I'm Macro! The very same one,
from the Dopey Macro Pirates!

147
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,540
Hey, I just said it myself...

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,980
Sounds like there's some trouble.

149
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,160
Why do you have Hatchin's Transponder Snail?

150
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,980
Because I beat up that Hachi punk, of course!

151
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,650
You're lying! Hatchin would
never lose to you guys!

152
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,010
Yeah, normally we're no match for Hachi,

153
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,920
but this time, we've teamed up
with the Flying Fish Riders!

154
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,050
The Flying Fish Riders?!

155
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,580
Camie, you're okay? Thank goodness.

156
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,070
Hatchin! Did they really beat you?

157
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,220
They sort of caught me off guard...

158
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,920
But you mustn't come here!

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,860
I'll wreak a little havoc and be
back home soon, so it'll be fine.

160
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,280
Hatchin...

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,330
Hey, Camie, I'm about to sell off your buddy!

162
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,170
Octopus fishmen are rare,
so he's worth a fortune!

163
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,160
If you want to come save
him, you're welcome to.

164
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,500
We're five kilometers east of Grove
#44 in the Sabaody Archipelago,

165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,440
at the hideout of the kidnapping
gang, the Flying Fish Riders.

166
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,380
No! Camie, don't come!

167
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,480
Shut up, you octopus!

168
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,170
Bye, now.

169
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,730
Hatchin...

170
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,890
Hey...

171
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,490
Camie-chan...

172
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,190
So, where's the takoyaki?

173
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,570
Is this really the time?!

174
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,150
Wait a minute...

175
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,290
The voice of that "Hatchin" guy on the
Transponder Snail sounded familiar...

176
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,790
I must be imagining it. Surely it's not...

177
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,560
Sorry, Luffy-chin.

178
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,050
Can I treat you to takoyaki some other time?

179
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,780
I have to go save my friend right away.

180
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,740
Aww...

181
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,860
Hey!

182
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,510
Hang on, Camie.

183
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,620
I don't mean to butt in, but if you
want to save your friend, we'll help.

184
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,020
Oh, my mistake. I meant these guys will help!

185
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,990
You little...!

186
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,310
So, what say you tell us how to
get to Fishman Island in exchange?

187
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,470
Really? Are you sure, Nami-chin?

188
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,690
Of course!

189
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,000
Right, Luffy?

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,580
Huh? Yeah.

191
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,960
You'll help me rescue Hatchin, Luffy-chin?!

192
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,450
Sure, but who's Hatchin, anyway?

193
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,310
He owns the takoyaki place where I work!

194
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,130
His takoyaki is the best in the world!

195
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, that's an important matter!

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, boys! We're gonna rescue the
takoyaki if it means our lives!

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,580
Yeah!

198
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,370
Takoyaki! Takoyaki!

199
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,150
They agreed. Do you know where he is?

200
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,170
Yeah... Um...

201
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,840
Grove #44 is the easternmost
island in the archipelago.

202
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,160
And he's five kilometers east of that...

203
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,130
So the Flying Fish Riders'
hideout is around here.

204
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,730
And we're right here,

205
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,180
so it's a straight shot from
here to the Sabaody Archipelago.

206
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,830
Let's start heading west!

207
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,630
From there, we can ask
the fish for directions.

208
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,210
Yeah, sounds good. Let's hurry!

209
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,340
Hey!

210
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,950
Wow! The fish are sticking their heads out!

211
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,290
I need you to give me directions!

212
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,470
They're afraid of the Flying Fish Riders,

213
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,850
so they'll take us as far as
the vicinity of their hideout.

214
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,980
That's amazing! You can talk to fish!

215
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,410
I had no idea mermaids could do that!

216
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,230
Camie, with you around, we'd
have all the fish we could eat!

217
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,140
Watch your mouth! I oughta kill you!

218
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,080
But how can we follow fish
if they're underwater?

219
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,460
Just watch.

220
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,950
Awesome!

221
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,010
Is that even possible? I can't believe it!

222
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,040
The fish are making an
arrow on the water for us!

223
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
That's great! So we just have to follow that!

224
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,640
You're pretty amazing, Camie!

225
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,050
Aww, I still have a long way to go.

226
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,220
Nah, I'm really impressed!

227
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,010
All right! I'll steer!

228
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,140
To four o'clock.

229
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,770
Got it!

230
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,280
Let's go, boys!

231
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,650
Yeah!

232
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,720
So you see, Master Duval, I've
lured a mermaid toward us.

233
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Yes, all is going as planned.

234
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,860
Understood. Hey, you guys.

235
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,190
Yes, Head.

236
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,670
Go out and meet her.

237
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,560
Roger.

238
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,920
U-Um...

239
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,130
She's valuable merchandise,
so please try not to harm her.

240
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,640
How encouraging...

241
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,590
Hey, Hachi! Your Camie is finished this time!

242
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,220
Well? Are you ready for that?

243
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,650
Oh, at a loss for words, are you?

244
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,630
Hey, Zoro.

245
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,930
Setting sail already? You're
not going to Fishman Island?

246
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,790
Forget about that, just check her out!

247
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,150
She's Camie, a mermaid. A
real mermaid! She's awesome!

248
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,970
Hello.

249
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,420
A mermaid?

250
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,510
First one I've ever seen.

251
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,070
He erased it! He just erased the memory!

252
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,760
We're just gonna make a little
detour to save her takoyaki friend.

253
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm worried, though. Hatchin sounded so weak.

254
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,550
I know they've done something awful to him.

255
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,580
Well, he's pretty tough. He'll be fine.

256
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,060
More importantly, you guys
accepted this task so easily.

257
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,140
Are you that confident in your skills?

258
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,550
Yep! We're strong!

259
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,470
Just so you know, there are several
kidnapping gangs operating around here.

260
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,930
The human trade is a booming business
in the Sabaody Archipelago.

261
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,280
They buy and sell humans?

262
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,650
That's nasty business.

263
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,020
Mermaids are sold at particularly high costs,

264
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,780
so the three Macro Pirates are
constantly out to kidnap Camie.

265
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,050
Hachi the takoyaki shop owner

266
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,210
probably doesn't realize we
were eaten by that sea monster,

267
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,910
and thinks we were taken
by the Macro Pirates,

268
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,790
which would be why he went after them.

269
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,040
That's probably right.

270
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,460
Hatchin is very kind and upright.

271
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,330
It's my fault.

272
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,180
Hearing about octopus and "Hachi"
makes me think of that idiot fishman.

273
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,300
If it's really him, I'm not saving him.

274
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,360
Okay, I guess that's not true.

275
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,470
Normally, Hachi would wipe
the floor with them easily,

276
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,440
but if the infamous Flying
Fish Riders are involved...

277
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,970
What are they?

278
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,620
They're a kidnapping gang that's been
throwing their weight around in this area lately.

279
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,060
Everyone says once they set their
sights on you, you're doomed.

280
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,510
Their boss is a guy in
an iron mask named Duval.

281
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,500
No one knows what he looks
like under the mask.

282
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,840
I hear he's searching for someone,

283
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,650
so he checks every ship that goes by here.

284
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,140
Sounds like a pain in the neck.

285
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,890
Well, anyway, Camie, don't worry.

286
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,090
We'll save the takoyaki!

287
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,400
He's a takoyaki maker!

288
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,040
Okay! Thanks, Luffy-chin!

289
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,650
All right, then!

290
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,610
Brook, play something to cheer everyone up!

291
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,830
With pleasure!

292
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,530
H-Huh?

293
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,680
Hey! There's trouble!

294
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,620
What is it, Camie?

295
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,670
The fish said sorry, but this
is as far as they'll go.

296
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,750
What? What's going on?

297
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,340
There they are! The Flying Fish Riders!

298
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,060
Where? I don't see anything.

299
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,130
Camie! Where are you going?

300
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,440
You have to hide!

301
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,190
No! Not in the sea! They're in the sky!

302
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,580
The fish are flying!

303
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,950
Cool!

304
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,370
This isn't the time to be impressed!

305
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,770
Damn! They're attacking!

306
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,210
Do flying fish fly like that?!

307
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,480
Hey! Did you see?

308
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,940
Yeah! There's no mistake!
It's the Straw Hats!

309
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,200
Contact the boss!

310
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,220
Roger!

311
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,720
We came to nab one mermaid,
but this is a huge catch!

312
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,140
Duval-sama is gonna be quaking with joy!

313
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,310
They're coming back!

314
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,690
Stay away!

315
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,460
Bombs?!

316
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,480
Bastards!

317
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,530
Gum-Gum...

318
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,580
72 Pound...

319
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,740
-Pistol! -Cannon!

320
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,330
That was close!

321
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,550
Be careful! Those flying fish can
fly for five minutes out of water!

322
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,760
Damn!

323
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,650
Yes, there's no mistake,
Duval-sama! It's them!

324
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,270
Right. Right... What?!

325
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,670
Go back! We're withdrawing for now!

326
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,110
What? Don't be stupid!

327
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,890
Duval-sama's orders!

328
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,860
Damn... Just when it was about to get good!

329
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,540
What happened?

330
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,400
Macro.

331
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,330
Yes, Master Duval?

332
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,960
It seems the mermaid you lured
out is on a pirate ship.

333
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,390
What? Camie's on a pirate ship?!

334
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,560
I've been waiting. I've been waiting so long.

335
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,940
That pirate ship is the
one I've been waiting for.

336
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,130
I'll kill him.

337
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,580
I'll kill the man who ruined my life!

338
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,700
Camie, run! It's a trap!

339
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,870
The voice we heard, and that silhouette...

340
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,310
Hey, what do you think?

341
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,240
Huh? Oh! So it was him?

342
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Now that we know that, there's no
way we're saving you, you octopus!

343
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,730
On the next episode of One Piece!

344
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,020
"The Fated Reunion! Save
the Imprisoned Fishman!"

345
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,110
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
