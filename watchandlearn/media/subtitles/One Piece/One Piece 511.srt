2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time I look up to
the sky after the rain

3
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,440
ame agari no sora wo aogu tabi

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
I think back to when I was a crybaby

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,150
nakimushi datta koro no boku wo omou

6
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
I was chasing somebody's back blindly

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,910
dareka no senaka wo gamushara ni oikaketa

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
Thinking "I want to be stronger"

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,700
"tsuyoku naritai" tte

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
The word "thank you" has
faded into the wind now

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,210
ima wa kaze ni kieta "arigatou"

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
boku wa tsuyoku nareteiru no kana?

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Am I getting stronger?

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
kotae wa mada desou ni nai kara sa

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,050
I don't know the answer yet

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
yappari mada aruiteiku yo

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,390
That's why I'll keep walking ahead

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
saa yukou

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,810
So let's go

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
Without stopping

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,110
tachidomaru koto naku

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,440
Without giving up to the flow of time

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll keep getting back up

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,410
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
The voice inside of me

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,840
boku no naka ni nagareru koe wa

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
keeps sustaining me

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,010
zutto zutto boku wo sasaeteru

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
itazura na ame ga jama suru kedo

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,260
Wicked rain will get in my way

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
nigedasanai kara

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
But I won't walk away

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
So let's go

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,690
saa yukou

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Tachidomaru koto naku

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,980
Without stopping

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Without giving up to the flow of time

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,160
nagareru toki ni makenai youni

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
nando mo tachimukai tsuzukeyou

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll keep getting back up

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I don't want to
lose something precious

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,380
taisetsu na mono ushinaitakunai kara

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
To the future I believe in...

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,680
shinjita sono saki e to...

48
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,940
The time is the Great Pirate Era.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,130
Countless pirates fight
desperately for the One Piece,

50
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,280
the great treasure left behind by
Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,470
also takes to the sea to become
the next King of the Pirates.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,500
As Luffy and his friends
overcome numerous adventures,

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
the World Government is less and
less able to ignore their existence.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
This is exciting!

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What kind of adventure
is waiting for us next?!

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,310
The crew, on its way to the New World,

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,730
will speed along the Grand Line again today!

59
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,900
Luffy lost his brother Ace in the
War of the Best against the Navy.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,400
After getting back on his
feet with Jimbei's help,

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
Luffy met Dark King Rayleigh.

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,530
What are you gonna do, Luffy-kun?

63
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm gonna go back.

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,580
To Marineford!

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,940
And the rest of the Straw
Hats learned the news.

66
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,300
Why?! What's going on?! What
made Luffy do this...?!

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,930
Luffy! I'm glad he's okay!

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,680
It's in today's newspaper?

69
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,000
Luffy!

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,960
"Unexpected Relanding! Luffy, to Marineford!"

71
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,860
At Marineford - Navy Headquarters
in the Grand Line...

72
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,160
CONFERENCE ROOM

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,160
It's incomprehensible!

74
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,860
Events in the War of the Best

75
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,760
revealed he's the stepbrother
of the late Portgas D. Ace

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,170
and the son of the Revolutionary Dragon

77
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,900
and also, the grandson of
Navy Vice Admiral Garp!

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,630
The pirate - Monkey D. Luffy!

79
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,600
He went missing after the war,
but he was alive as expected

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,720
and resurfaced here,
at the Navy HQ, again!

81
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,770
A FEW DAYS AGO...

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,770
A few days ago...

83
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,710
How terrible!

84
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,120
It was an all-out war

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,750
between the Navy's elite and
the world's greatest pirate.

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,610
It's lucky that the island didn't sink.

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,170
Where did you come from?

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,930
I'm from Alabasta, to do a story
on Crocodile and Straw Hat.

89
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,720
Straw Hat could be dead already though.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm sure that the Navy wants to look
for the pirates involved in the war

91
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,440
but they don't have time for that now.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,820
Yeah.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,450
The One Piece is real!!

94
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,260
Pirates inspired by Whitebeard's dying words

95
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,660
are committing crimes all over the world.

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,840
All the Navy soldiers who can fight
are dealing with them everywhere.

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,760
I feel sorry for them.

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,340
Speak of the devil, here come the soldiers.

99
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,810
What's wrong with that ship?
It's not coming into the bay!

100
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,020
They're acting strange.

101
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,940
Firing a blank?!

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,230
What's going on?!

103
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,620
--Have they contacted us?!
--No, sir!

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,250
No way! Why did he come back...?!

105
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,500
What's the matter?!

106
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,300
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

107
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
What?!

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,960
--Did he steal a Navy ship?!
--Why now?

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,010
He never learns... Sink the ship!

110
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,520
Fish-Man Jiu-Jitsu!

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
Ocean Current Shoulder Throw!

112
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,280
Is that the traitor - "First
Son of the Sea" Jimbei?!

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
There is someone else!

114
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,250
Don't tell me that that's the legendary...

115
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,010
...first mate of the Roger
Pirates - Dark King Rayleigh!

116
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,750
Why don't they come ashore?

117
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,320
They went around the island once...

118
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,430
It's like a funeral at sea!

119
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,500
Funeral? Because our main
forces aren't here now?!

120
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,420
Damn pirates! Barrage
them from all directions!

121
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,530
Go ahead and let loose on them!

122
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,520
Yeah!

123
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,540
Catch Straw Hat!

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,330
I'll fight you guys!

125
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,710
I want you guys to play with me as well!

126
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,710
Gum-Gum...

127
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,550
...Whip!

128
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,180
What is he up to?! He's heading west!

129
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,220
Does he want to bring the HQ down?!

130
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,940
What is he gonna do with the Ox Bell?

131
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,890
Flowers?

132
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,240
This is gonna be a great picture!

133
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,890
Chase him! Don't let him get away!

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
Now he's leaving...

135
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,220
What was that all about?

136
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,060
Dark King Rayleigh and
the Warlord - Jimbei...

137
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,770
Are they taking his side?!

138
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,070
Rayleigh was a crew member
of the King of the Pirates.

139
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,290
Does that mean Straw Hat
is Roger's successor?!

140
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,990
N-No way! He's Dragon's
son! That can't be true...

141
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,950
In any case, this is...

142
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,410
...big news!

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
This article has spread all
over the world already!

144
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,770
It even covers the fact that
we let Straw Hat get away!

145
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,980
How humiliating!

146
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,320
If you look at it simply, what
Straw Hat did was pay a tribute...

147
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,030
...to his brother and Whitebeard and
all other people who died in the war.

148
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,120
No doubt about the moment of silence
and going around the island

149
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,290
but the bell should only have
been rung twice not 16 times!

150
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,670
So the 16 bells could be a challenge to us!

151
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,760
Honestly! How controversial he is.

152
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,580
Straw Hat Luffy...

153
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,680
But it's not so surprising
considering he's Garp's grandson.

154
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,730
I wonder how he knows Rayleigh.

155
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,900
I don't think Rayleigh wants
to come back to center stage.

156
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,270
Jimbei finally turned against us.

157
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,490
He being a Warlord was a
symbol of intertribal peace.

158
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,030
What a shame!

159
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,240
The Three Great Powers are off-balance now.

160
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,910
How should we fill the 3 vacancies
among The Seven Warlords?

161
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,460
We need to see what will
unfold in the New World.

162
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,170
There'll be some changes in power
relationships among pirates.

163
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,550
We have to pick the most powerful ones.

164
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,890
Blackbeard made his move
already in the New World

165
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,560
and took out one of the rookies
with a bounty of over 100 million.

166
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,230
He knows all there is to know
about Whitebeard's territory.

167
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,360
He has a lead over the pirates who want
to become one of The Four Emperors.

168
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,120
No one has ever eaten 2 Devil
Fruits in history except for him.

169
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,760
The people who might be able to
stop him are The Four Emperors...

170
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,880
...or Marco the Phoenix and the
remnants of the Whitebeards.

171
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,340
It's always the "D."s who make
trouble including "Portgas."

172
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,360
Those names are exposed to the public
a little bit too much these days.

173
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,460
I tried to talk him out of it
but Garp virtually resigned.

174
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,460
RED LINE THE HOLYLAND OF MARIE JOIS

175
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,480
But he has to keep his
title and stay in the Navy.

176
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,230
Educating young Navy soldiers.

177
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,400
If you want to resign from your
position as fleet admiral,

178
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
could you at least do that?

179
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,640
Sengoku.

180
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes, sir.

181
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,360
I accept that offer. It's not a
bad way to spend my retired life.

182
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,320
The two of you who have led the
Navy at the front since Roger's era

183
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,870
are stepping down.

184
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,120
That's going to make quite a splash.

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,920
Including the escaped prisoners
from level 6 at Impel Down,

186
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,440
there are a lot of infamous
pirates still on the loose.

187
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,210
And Newgate was at the top of the list.

188
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
The Pirate Era is changing now

189
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,640
and old soldiers shouldn't
cling to power in the Navy.

190
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,390
Justice is based on values. And
those change every generation.

191
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,650
That's not what I want to hear.

192
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,650
By the way, Kong-san,

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,200
I want to recommend Aokiji
for next fleet admiral.

194
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,630
NAVY HEADQUARTERS--MEDICAL CARE FACILITY

195
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,630
They call the power Haki.

196
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,540
It's safe to say that's what you got.

197
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,260
I guess it was awakened
by the trauma of the war.

198
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,180
Normally, you can only obtain
it through long-term training.

199
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,710
Haki...? That's what it is?

200
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,780
The vice admirals are all using it.

201
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,290
Really?!

202
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,630
I feel other people's presence too
strongly...

203
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,000
It's uncomfortable...

204
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,250
You two are apprentices to Garp, aren't you?

205
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,920
Ask him about it.

206
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,710
Hey, doctor! Do you think
I will get the power, too?

207
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,260
How do I know?

208
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,350
Dammit! It's like you're ahead of me now!

209
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,730
I don't know what's going on...

210
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,870
But what is this feeling?

211
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,260
It's like I'm a different person from before!

212
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,700
Maybe... If I try hard, I can get stronger!

213
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,720
Much stronger than I am
now... As strong as him!

214
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,250
I'm sorry! I couldn't hold the fort!

215
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,760
Don't mind it!

216
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,220
He was alive, huh? Amazingly!

217
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,650
Did you hear about it? Straw
Hat caused trouble again.

218
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,310
Yes.

219
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,730
The War of the Best ended not so
long ago and the 16 bells now?

220
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,400
Is this some kind of message?

221
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,570
I don't know.

222
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,240
That aside, what about my transfer?

223
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,670
Well, I'll talk to Sengoku-san
about it but are you serious?

224
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,880
No one would say such a thing as a joke.

225
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,300
I know. G5 is not a place
that you go voluntarily.

226
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,980
That place has a bunch of problems.

227
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,810
Navy - Grand Line 5th branch.

228
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,440
That means you wanna go to the New World.

229
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,610
It's better to be closer to your target.

230
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,500
The news about Straw Hat Luffy
is spreading all over the world.

231
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,740
NEW WORLD

232
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,740
Even in the New World...

233
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,200
"Straw Hat Luffy was alive!"

234
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,790
EUSTASS "CAPTAIN" KID

235
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,770
"Rang the 16 bells for a
new era in Marineford."

236
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,210
What's the Ox Bell?

237
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,970
The Ox Bell is...

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,470
...the holy bell from the Ox Lloyd's,

239
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,890
KID PIRATES--KILLER

240
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,890
a Navy ship that was quite
influential a long time ago.

241
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,770
At the year's end, they ring it 8
times to appreciate the passing year

242
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,170
and 8 times at the beginning of the
year as a prayer for the new year.

243
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,280
So they ring it 16 times in total
- that's the Navy's custom.

244
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,320
That's the meaning of the 16 bells.

245
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,660
But it's not the season yet.

246
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,120
So maybe he did it to announce the
end and the beginning of the era.

247
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,670
He wants to say,

248
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,920
"Whitebeard's era is over.
I'll shape the new era"?

249
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,510
If it's not for those purposes, he
wouldn't go back to the place...

250
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,020
...where he has to relive the
pain of losing his brother.

251
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,890
What an annoying bastard!

252
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,270
In fact, after the war,

253
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,860
he took the lead among the rookies
with a bounty of over 100 million.

254
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,360
But I won't let him do whatever he wants.

255
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,950
The New World...

256
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,540
I thought I could have a lot of fun
here but what's with these cowards?

257
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,040
Come on! I didn't cause any harm to you!

258
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,420
We were about to get out of this sea!
Let us go back to paradise alive!

259
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,510
Paradise? You mean, a loving home?

260
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:10,230
You just got here so you have no
idea how horrible this sea is!

261
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,260
Straw Hat?

262
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,650
Yes, he caused trouble again.

263
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,240
CAPONE "GANG" BEGE

264
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,240
No need to be panic.

265
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
The one who has the final checkmate...

266
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,830
...will become the winner.

267
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,160
What happened?!

268
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,500
Father! The ship is not touching
the water - it's in the air!

269
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,090
What?!

270
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,840
What did you say? What do you
mean? Control the ship, dammit!

271
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,260
Father! Something's coming
down from the sky...

272
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,900
No, we are going up!

273
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,900
NEW WORLD FOODVALTEN ISLAND

274
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm so sorry.

275
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,570
BASIL HAWKINS

276
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,570
Could you say it again? I couldn't catch it.

277
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm Brownbeard!

278
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,740
A pirate with a bounty of over 80 million!

279
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,040
Brownbeard-sama!

280
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,750
Make sure you remember my
name! This is my territory!

281
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,160
What you did to my men is horrible!

282
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll make you pay for it in blood!

283
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,190
I see. I thought I misheard it
because it's such a stupid name.

284
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,270
I'll tell you two things.
First, I don't like jokes.

285
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,430
Jokes?

286
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,770
And here is another thing,

287
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,480
I can see the shadow of death on your face.

288
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,250
Are you sure that the Log Pose
is pointing at that island?!

289
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,620
Lightning is striking the island like rain!

290
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,040
UROUGE

291
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,040
We can't go there!

292
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,420
How can we get to the shore?!

293
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,020
Bold men who set foot in
the New World even once...

294
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,480
High Priest, somebody is approaching!

295
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,600
Who is it?

296
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,530
...all call the first half of
the Grand Line the same thing -

297
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,030
Say, young man...

298
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,320
Who is this grandma?

299
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,350
"That sea was like a paradise."

300
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,790
Do you want an umbrella?

301
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,920
If we stay here, we'll be dead soon!

302
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,130
We just wanna go back to paradise! Please!

303
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,040
You're such a wet blanket.

304
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,930
If you're not prepared to die...

305
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,560
...then stay out of...

306
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,820
...this sea!

307
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,070
I'll take you down soon!
You better be ready for it!

308
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,080
Straw Hat!

309
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,610
Reports on the new incident
involving Luffy at Marineford

310
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,200
spread throughout the world
in the blink of an eye.

311
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,640
The people are bewildered
by his mysterious actions,

312
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,430
as are his friends.

313
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,970
But Luffy has a reason for his behavior.

314
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,770
What exactly is Luffy thinking?!

315
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,130
On the next episode of One Piece!

316
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,980
"With Hopes It Will Reach My
Friends! Big News Spreading Fast!"

317
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,370
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!!
