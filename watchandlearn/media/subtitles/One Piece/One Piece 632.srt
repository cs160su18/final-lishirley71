The unchanging bond will light
up the "end of the dream"

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
Wake up! Wake up! Wake

Freedom is our only compass,
We are best friends

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,580

Why not drag the sun out into the sky

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,340

I'm gonna find the One Piece

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,050
and become the King of the Pirates!

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,550

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
kokoro no chizu hirogete

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,750
Open up the sailing chart in your heart

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
The bond with potential power
will seize the "end of the dream"

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,920
chikara wo himeta kizuna wa

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,490
Never! Never! Never! Never Stop it!

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,760
We are the one! Go ahead!

64
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,730
All the pirates who are
after the One Piece...

65
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,670
...head for the New World,
the second half of the Grand Line.

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,320
However, no one has ever fully explored it
except for Gold Roger, King of the Pirates.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,060
The New World has ruined
many pirates' dreams and ambitions.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body turned
to rubber after he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit,

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,900
and his friends venture into that sea.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

71
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,880
To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,350
Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law.

73
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,410
Planning to hand over Caesar,
who they caught in Punk Hazard,

74
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,020
and to destroy the factory
producing the deadly weapon - SMILE,

75
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,560
they came to Dressrosa -
the kingdom that Doflamingo rules.

76
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,630
Ace's...

77
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,900
...Flare-Flare Fruit?!

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,640
"A Dangerous Love!
The Dancer Girl - Violet!"

79
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,630
The champion will get a Devil Fruit?!

80
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,500
On top of that, it's none other than "Fire-Fist" Ace's
Flare-Flare Fruit?!

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,740
Today, here in this Colosseum,

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,150
we have tough fighters from the New World
who were summoned by our king

83
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,920
and brave participants from the public
who are confident of their ability.

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,210
They will be divided into separate blocks

85
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,600
and the winners of each block
will get to go to the next round.

86
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,870
However, they can't have this valuable prize
so easily!

87
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,770
It's theirs for the taking - if they can!

88
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,440
The gladiators that they're gonna fight
are not the ordinary bunch!

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,810
The ones who are gonna fight
the winners of each block are...

90
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,680
From the Don Quixote Family...

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,660
Señor Pink!

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,870
Dellinger!

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,340
Lao G.!

94
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,150
Machvise!

95
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,480
And the hero of the Colosseum...

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,830
Mr. Diamante!

97
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,540
--Diamante-sama!
--Diamante!

98
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,410
Just start already!

99
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,550
We wanna see a fight!

100
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,680
Can't wait any longer!
Just start a match already!

101
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,040
How did Ace's Flare-Flare Fruit get here?!

102
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,370
Huh?!

103
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,310
I heard there are no two

104
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,330
Devil Fruits of the same
power existing at once.

105
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,110
However,

106
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,520
when a Devil Fruit eater dies,

107
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,460
a Devil Fruit with the power that

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,100
the deceased possessed will pop
up again somewhere in the world.

109
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,660
And when somebody eats it,
he'll become the new holder of that power.

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,570
After "Fire-Fist" Ace died,

111
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,830
the Flare-Flare Fruit was,
without anyone knowing, reproduced

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,430
and the Young Master-sama got hold of it!

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,610
That bastard!

114
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,500
I can't believe the Young Master-sama

115
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,330
made the Logia type Devil Fruit
a prize for the competition!

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,650
If I can possess such incredible power,
my life will change!

117
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,450
I'm not gonna let you eat it!

118
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,090
Now I remember. Ace was your...

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,930
I want it! The Flare-Flare Fruit!

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,240
Oh yeah! Why don't you eat it, Franky?

121
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,880
I don't wanna lose my ability to swim.

122
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,720
I ate the Gum-Gum Fruit so
I can't eat another one.

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,490
But I don't want some stranger
to possess Ace's power.

124
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,130
It's like a memento of him to you, isn't it?

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,770
It's possible that it's a trap
considering the way

126
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,090
Doflamingo dangled it in front of you.

127
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,710
I have something that you'll
want very badly now.

128
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,150
But one thing is for sure!

129
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,720
You shouldn't let the chance slip by!

130
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
You don't wanna regret it afterward.

131
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,930
We have to go to the Colosseum anyway.

132
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,060
Let's just go there!

133
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,160
Uh-huh!

134
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,400
Idiots!

135
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,380
If you think you can have it just because

136
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,510
you want it, no one would
be risking their life.

137
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,410
Don't underestimate the
level of the competitors.

138
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,080
THE GROUP THAT WENT AFTER
THE MYSTERIOUS FAIRY

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,140
They call it a fairy?!
It's just a dirty thief!

140
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,080
Where did it go?

141
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,580
This way!

142
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,850
I said "Wait"!

143
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,420
Just give up a sword or two!

144
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,450
No way, idiot!

145
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,760
Damn!

146
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,960
I won't let it get away!

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,900
Stop striking off on your own!
We don't have that much time!

148
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh, that's...

149
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,400
Did you find the fairy?!

150
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,010
A fairy...

151
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,180
No, she must be a goddess.

152
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,480
What?!

153
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,430
A DANCER - VIOLET

154
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,660
--How fascinating!
--How intense!

155
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,140
You're the best dancer in the world!

156
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,150
Huh?

157
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,730
S...

158
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,790
She's beautiful!

159
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,300
You heard that women in this country stab men,
didn't you?

160
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,270
A guy like you will get stabbed.

161
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,270
I don't mind getting stabbed!

162
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,480
Oh no! I lost him!

163
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,290
That stray Moss Head!

164
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,820
Aha!

165
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,330
This is a good chance.
Let's leave him on this island!

166
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,830
I tried as best as I could to catch him.
I made a sincere effort!

167
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,380
There are so many couples around here!
I'm jealous!

168
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,060
I wish Nami-san and Robin-chan suddenly
became attracted to me!

169
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,260
Excuse me!

170
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,000
We caught each other's eye earlier,
didn't we?

171
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,000
Please! Hold me!

172
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
What?!

173
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,900
Where did she go?!

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,940
She must've slipped out the back door
to this Lover's Alley!

175
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,370
I don't think she went that far yet!

176
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,540
--We can't let her leave the town!
--Yes, sir!

177
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,620
Thank you! They're gone now.

178
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,350
Excuse me. You can let go of me now.

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,760
Well... It's really my pleasure!

180
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,230
I'm sorry! Did you hit
your head or something?

181
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,570
No, it's just meeting you
comes as a shock to me!

182
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,670
But you're bleeding a lot!

183
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,380
No, it's nothing...

184
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,940
It must hurt.

185
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,550
No! I can't help falling in love!

186
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,520
What?! No, you shouldn't
look at me like that!

187
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,120
I have already given up on love!

188
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,390
All the men who have gotten
involved with me are…

189
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,400
Yes!

190
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,630
They were all happy!

191
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,270
They were looking for you! Who were they?!

192
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,770
Tell me if there's something
I can do to help!

193
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,940
They were the police.

194
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,550
There was this man and I...

195
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,490
...stabbed him after things went sour.

196
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,220
What?!

197
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,140
So it's true that women in this

198
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,270
country are so passionate about
love that they'd stab a man for it!

199
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,260
--Okay!
--Okay?! Really?!

200
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,600
What's wrong now?!

201
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,470
No! Don't be so nice to a bad woman like me!

202
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,510
What?

203
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,210
Or I will... fall for you.

204
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,080
BANG!!

205
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,620
My name is Violet.

206
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,130
Could you escort me to the next town
if you don't mind?

207
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,800
The next town?

208
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,370
And...

209
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,840
...I want you to kill someone!

210
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,110
What?

211
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,790
I don't care if it's a
national treasure or not!

212
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,360
I can't allow myself to lose the Shusui!

213
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,130
Boy! First, we saw toys living side-by-side
with humans

214
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,700
and now, a thieving fairy?!

215
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,770
Damn! What an annoying island!

216
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,930
It was fairies who took your stuff.

217
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,770
What are you talking about?!

218
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,410
We have to turn a blind
eye to whatever they do.

219
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,610
If it was a fairy or not,
I'm gonna catch it and...

220
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,810
Well, I'm gonna chop it up
to get the sword back!

221
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,820
Wait! You thief-fairy!

222
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,430
"Dear Nami-san and Robin-chan."

223
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,200
"I hope you will forgive this sinful man."

224
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,340
"I finally... finally...

225
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,050
...met the love of my life!"

226
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,690
I'm your bodyguard.

227
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,090
Yes. I was born to protect you!

228
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,670
I love this romantic island - Dressrosa!

229
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,040
I will get the national treasure of the Wano Kingdom
back for sure!

230
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,550
But first, I have to rescue Kanjuro
who is held captive by Doflamingo's clan!

231
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,650
Kanjuro!

232
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,690
Why are you rushing?!

233
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,320
Wh-What was that?!

234
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,760
She was trying to show her
affection for me apparently!

235
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,230
How aggressive! But...

236
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,270
Come stop by for a while!

237
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,200
I-I shouldn't allow myself!

238
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,010
Yielding to a young lady's temptation is...

239
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,940
...a dishonor to a warrior!

240
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,240
Where are you?! Kanjuro!

241
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,820
I'm coming in!

242
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,720
Mister, you can't just come in.

243
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,390
We're closed now!

244
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,330
They have some stuff to cook.

245
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,330
But the knives and frying
pans are not well maintained.

246
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,900
They haven't even washed their dishes.

247
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,500
These are the guys. No wonder.

248
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,510
Who do you think you are?!

249
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm gonna cook for
the most wonderful lady in the world.

250
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,380
Get out of this kitchen!

251
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,450
Don't mess with us cooks!

252
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,490
Wh-Who is he?

253
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,090
You shouldn't mess with a cook.

254
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,930
Let me use this kitchen for a while.

255
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Violet-chan!

256
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,240
I think dancing requires stamina.

257
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,020
Enjoy this tasty and nutritious special dish!

258
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,420
Are you...

259
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
Wait!

260
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,460
You thief-fairy!

261
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,060
Moss Head?!

262
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,230
Where are you?!

263
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,060
Kanjuro!

264
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,800
Kin'emon!

265
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,670
Is there something wrong?

266
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh no. Not at all.

267
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,450
I wasn't planning to go off on my own.

268
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,480
Forgive me, Luffy.

269
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,650
Because it's destiny!

270
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,850
THE CORRIDA COLOSSEUM

271
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,550
Is this...

272
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,960
It's a huge Colosseum!

273
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,320
What kind of competition is it gonna be?!

274
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,560
The people are going nuts!
That makes me wanna enter the competition!

275
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,630
They're going crazy!

276
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,870
He's making it harder for us!

277
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,170
Just give up already!

278
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,170
You infamous wanted toy soldier!

279
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,010
You can't shoot me!

280
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,380
Jet Walk!

281
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,300
You guys are too slow! Look!

282
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,440
I have my foot in the Colosseum!

283
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,680
THE ONE-LEGGED SOLDIER
AKA THE ANGRY LIGHTNING SOLDIER

284
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,680
You know the law, don't you?!

285
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,410
The police and the Navy are not allowed
in the Colosseum!

286
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,190
Even if a criminal is in the Colosseum,
it's not your jurisdiction!

287
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,660
The only rule of law in here
is that of the Don Quixote Family!

288
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,930
If you pull that trigger,
you will become a criminal yourself!

289
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,030
Go away!

290
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,570
Damn!

291
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,040
This island is so strange.
They put a toy on the wanted list?!

292
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,610
And he's very arrogant for a toy!

293
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,550
Oh, elderly people!
Do you want me to carry your bag or something?

294
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,860
Huh? He became polite all of a sudden.

295
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,320
What a funny toy soldier!

296
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,890
Oh?

297
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,230
Am I funny?

298
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,870
What about this? Or this?

299
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,900
Hey buddy, get out of our way.

300
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,070
Oh, I was in your way. I'm sorry!

301
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,110
You're blushing so much!

302
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,310
You're a serious guy, aren't you?

303
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,780
N-No way!

304
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,590
Toys have to make people smile!
There is no such a thing as a serious toy!

305
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,720
He took it personally!

306
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:49,160
We're closing entries from the public
for today's competition!

307
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,370
I don't think anyone from the public wants to enter.
They're all cowards!

308
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,940
Hey Luffy!
I guess we have to go in separately.

309
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,110
Okay.

310
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,610
Oh, here, here! I want to enter!

311
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,850
Enter! Enter! Enter! Enter!

312
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,050
What?

313
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,890
What?!

314
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,020
No, you don't! You're too old!
